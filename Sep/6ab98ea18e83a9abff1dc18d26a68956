She mentions that from a profitability perspective, WorkBook will allow for greater visibility into resource capacity, as well as actual billable time spent on jobs. Within a growing company, this really helps. In addition to WorkBook, the Hoorah team will be moving over to Deltek ConceptShare – an online proofing software that fully integrates with WorkBook - and will eliminate time wasted on emailing reverts to clients. Ms Kingma believes this will save massive amounts of time for everyone involved – especially their production clients.
