Ninow is the man who pleaded guilty to raping a seven-year-old at a Dros restaurant last year. He pleaded guilty to rape, possession of drugs and defeating the ends of justice — but pleaded not guilty to assault.According to Mitchley, the witness approached the journalists outside the Gauteng High Court in Pretoria during a tea break, asking why media houses named him. It was explained that there was no court order not to name the witness as he testified in an open court.He then looked at the journalists and said that he was going to slit their throats while making a throat-slitting gesture. “I told him to leave us alone and would inform the court of his threats. He tried following to apologise, but I told him to get away from me as he had just threatened our lives,” Mitchley said.The witness came to court to confront journalists as he finished testifying on Monday.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497966-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: Refreshing the legalities of ethical reporting on children" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Refreshing the legalities of ethical reporting on childrenWith #YouthMonth just around the corner, what better time to put the focus on how to more ethically report on violence against children?By Leigh Andrews 27 May 2019“The harassment of journalists, not just by authorities and politicians, but lately general members of the public in protest areas, is a phenomenon that has prompted growing concerns for Sanef in recent months,” said the editors’ forum in a statement.Sanef adds that it “notes that while retaliation for the content of professional output is common to all journalists, female journalists face an additional burden in that they are also attacked purely based on their gender.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/466660-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The 'old boys club' and glass ceilings for women in the SA news media" width="120" height="120">The 'old boys club' and glass ceilings for women in the SA news mediaThe 2018 Glass ceiling report on women in the South African news media shows that female journalists still battle sexist and patriarchal attitudes, lower wages, less opportunities for ascension to managerial positions, and are increasingly targets of online harassment...By Prof. Ylva Rodny-Gumede 31 Oct 2018While concluding on the matter, Sanef said that it wished to caution against impunity for threats of any nature and crimes against the media because it fuels and perpetuates the cycle of violence and the resulting self-censorship deprives society of information and further affects press freedom.

However, we believe this should not be used as an excuse to trigger an all-out attack on the media and journalists as a collective. Rather than a verdict being debated on social media, we ask that this matter be dealt with via the media house concerned,” the forum advised.
