In fact, Pixelate’s 2017 research shows 20% of pay-per-click conversions are fraudulent while FraudLogix estimates 50% of ad impressions served on Internet Explorer were for non-human traffic in 2016. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/460097-120x120.jpg?2" alt="How to stay afloat when fake online reviews could sink your business" width="120" height="120">How to stay afloat when fake online reviews could sink your businessFake news is a pervasive epidemic.

However, Williams cautioned that big data as a strategy can be dangerous. Firstly, the prospect of consumer backlash in light of the growing pushback against privacy invasion and discriminatory “price diversity” managed by biased bots and algorithms. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/470932.jpg" alt="Privacy vs Profit: Will 2019 be the year of consumer paranoia?" width="120" height="120">Privacy vs Profit: Will 2019 be the year of consumer paranoia?On the surface of our tech-dependent lives, all appears to be wonderfully beneficial and benign...By Colin Thornton 26 Nov 2018“Legal restrictions that limit consumer data collection (e.g. GDPR in the EU or PoPI in South Africa) are also a reality and legislation is in the pipeline that will force companies to financially compensate consumers for collecting and using their data.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1312/163383-120x120.jpg" alt="Will POPI become a dirty word for marketers?" width="120" height="120">Will POPI become a dirty word for marketers?The Protection of Personal Information Act No. 4 of 2013 (POPI) was signed into law in November.

But, is that so bad?...By Richard Lord 22 Jun 2018Data eats the worldShe also outlined the concept of unconscious consumerism; “As consumers and businesses increasingly outsource their purchase decisions to algorithms and artificially intelligent voice-activated personal assistants, brands and businesses will increasingly find themselves selling to machines rather than to humans - and, as such, competing in a zero-sum, lowest-cost game. As “data eats the world”, the advertising, marketing, branding, PR and communications industries find themselves competing for smaller and smaller slices of the same shrinking pie. New industry competitors include AI creative directors and “Social” social media agencies namely; crowd-sourced creative agencies taking advantage of the bounty work economy, such as one-minute briefs. Social media past its prime?Williams said society is rapidly approaching peak social media as we know it. “This is where the social media platforms built for and by millennials (Facebook, Instagram and Twitter) have passed their prime (as have the ageing millennials themselves, the first of whom are now approaching their 40th birthday). Soon they could be semi-abandoned wastelands, with only brands left, picking like vultures at the last human laggards left. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/489902-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Khumo Theko, trend spotter at Flux Trends." width="120" height="120">Brands, pay attention to these new urban tribesKhumo Theko, trend spotter at Flux Trends highlights and identifies new urban tribes that brands should be aware of when communicating to their consumers...By Juanita Pienaar 3 Apr 2019“That said, social media itself as an idea is not going anywhere just yet: the next evolution of social media is in the “spatial web” (or with virtual and augmented reality). Already 1 in 800 humans worldwide can be found playing Fortnite at any given time.”Going forward, augmented reality games such as Google’s Pokemon Go and Microsoft’s Minecraft Earth will encourage marketers to pay per person, to get augmented reality games to direct human players to the physical places companies want people to visit. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490794-120x120.jpg?2" alt="How AR and VR will transform the retail experience" width="120" height="120">How AR and VR will transform the retail experienceAugmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) have the potential to shake up the customer experience by individualising retailers' offers and enabling customers to visualise products in different settings.

On the negative side, Brand-jacking or “anti-influencing” is a new trend in which activists or competitors, hire influencers to trash bad or competing brands. Ad mules are the drug mules of the influencer industry. These are people who rent their social media accounts to launder illicit ads.” The emotion economyThe big data economy has evolved. “First it came for our minds, with persuasive hyper-targeted advertising offers and then it came for our bodies, with nudges, or incentives to act in a particular (profitable) way. Now big data is coming for our hearts with the arrival of  the emotion economy, where big data is being used to both measure and manipulate human emotions.” (Try the emotion economy yourself here.)However, the reality is that the emotion economy has taken a toll on society. “Generation Z, the first generational cohort of digital natives, born approximately between 1994 and 2014, have never known life without the internet. They also no longer know the luxury of being ‘off’ or ‘backstage’. Thanks to Wi-Fi, cellphones, public facial recognition systems, wearable technology and all the other conveniences of contemporary life, Generation Z is always on stage.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/464020-120x120.jpg?2" alt="What Generation Z wants - how to attract the &amp;quot;next&amp;quot; generation to your brand and business" width="120" height="120">What Generation Z wants - how to attract the "next" generation to your brand and businessMillennials are already in their mid-thirties.

For example, through the deployment of Therapy Marketing, where advertising itself is used as a way to make society better by making people feel better about themselves, both physically and mentally.”Brand activismIn light of these challenges, and in order to connect with the ever-elusive woke consumer, brands are rejecting the principle of the separation of church, state and business, for better or for worse. “Brand activism is increasing where brands are taking a public stand on controversial social and political issues while morality marketing has seen Brands appointing themselves as judge, jury, priest and executioner by actively rewarding and punishing consumers for good and bad behaviour respectively. Williams cautioned, however; “As great as the rewards are for calling the zeitgeist correctly, brands need to understand that playing the identity politics game is as perilous as walking a tightrope - even a small, unintentional misstep can have serious consequences.” For more information e-mail: connected@fluxtrends.co.zabRev('brev-f97e30c7-8055-4381-9269-fe4234cb59bf', '>a/\<az.oc.sdnertxulf@detcennoc>"az.oc.sdnertxulf;46#&detcennoc:otliam:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<') or follow on Twitter:  @fluxtrends and @bronwynwilliams.
