Being in that room judging was inspiring as it gave me the opportunity to see the best our industry will employ in the very near future.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/514268.jpg" alt="Vega shines at the 2019 Loeries with two golds" width="120" height="120">Vega shines at the 2019 Loeries with two goldsTwelve students from Vega received top honours at this year's Loeries Awards, bagging two golds, two silvers and one bronze Loerie award for their work...Issued by Vega School 30 Aug 2019Much of the work was beautifully crafted and I could see the level of commitment and passion that students have. If you are already thinking about next year’s entries or others on your road to Loeries 2020, here is some advice. I hope it helps.Create work that can exist in the real worldTelling stories that people can relate to is one of the things creatives should aspire to. Find your voice as a young creative and make your work relatable if you want to get into people's hearts and communicate with them effectively. Tell personal stories, no one can ever replicate your story.Have fun with your work, set the scene, make your work compelling and make sure it’s understandable to someone who knows nothing about it. Judges will be judging lots of entries, make their jobs as easy as possible.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1803/434129-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Open Window's Loeries 2017 winners, L to R: Zinhle Zulu, Matthew Tager, Nicole Laxton and Samantha Kogel." width="120" height="120">The Open Window on student creativitySome of the academic team and most recent student award-winners from The Open Window let us in on their most recent successes based on their experimental stylistic exploration of creative briefs, which they treat as the real deal...By Leigh Andrews 23 Mar 2018Ideas are as important as the work itselfDon't be precious about your ideas, you are still going to come up with so many more. Having the right idea is key to avoid working in circles. Learn about the world, every experience could be the insight you need for your next idea.Immerse your ideas in other cultures to see connections that could otherwise be missed. However beautiful your work may be, if the idea is mediocre, I’m sorry to say that its very hard to polish a turd.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511005.jpg" alt="All the reasons why agencies should be at Loeries Woolworths Student Portfolio Day" width="120" height="120">All the reasons why agencies should be at Loeries Woolworths Student Portfolio DayThis year's Woolworths Student Portfolio Day provides all ad agencies and industry leaders with the exclusive and first look at the industry's top future talent...Issued by Woolworths 12 Aug 2019Be originalI believe the best work is brilliantly simple, original and compelling. Steal like an artist and learn from people you look up to but do not plagiarise work.Judges come from different organisations all over the world; there is a big chance any one of them would have seen the work somewhere. Strive to produce something new, rather than work that seems familiar.PresentationPresentation is so important as you need to get the attention of the judges for your work to be noticed. But at the same time don’t be too dramatic.You don’t have to shock people to communicate with them effectively. Judges go through a lot of good boards, don’t lose their attention. Ensure you can tell the story simply so judges will be able to instantly grasp what you’re saying.This week we'll be highlighting the Vega student work that won at @Loeries 2019.

School is a great time to learn that big isn’t always better; clever creativity with impact is what wins clients and awards.Right categoryPaying attention to detail plays a pivotal role in the life and work of every creative. Making sure your work is entered in the right category has to be the first factor to consider. It broke my heart to see work that deserved some acknowledgment but was entered in the wrong category.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513395.jpg" alt="Vega Johannesburg and Mandela University students win Facebook Challenge Student Awards at Loeries" width="120" height="120">Vega Johannesburg and Mandela University students win Facebook Challenge Student Awards at LoeriesVega Johannesburg students - Vini Xavier, Tshego Kwele and Cara Brauckman - have won the gold award in the Facebook Challenge for 2019; while Mandela University students - Sibuyiselwe Nhlangwini, Thembelihle Buthelezi, and Mseki Ludwe Mkinase - clinched the bronze runner-up award...Issued by Vega School 26 Aug 2019In a nutshell, I was very impressed by the level of skill, creativity and enthusiasm in the entries.
