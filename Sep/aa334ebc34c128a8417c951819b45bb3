<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517654.jpg" alt="Beware legacide: A lethal killer" width="542" height="328">Global media and advertising industries have witnessed “the fall of giants” as a result of legacy thinking. Yahoo is a case in point. In 2005 Yahoo was a dominant player in online advertising. Unfortunately, its leadership decided to focus on becoming a media giant and ignored the importance of search, this at a time when consumers were just beginning to understand how they could use the internet as a tool for entertainment and research. The company was also given the opportunity, but decided not to, buy Google in 2002 and Facebook in 2006, in hindsight two lethal mistakes that has seen the company slip in the ranks.Where companies might have gotten away with a certain degree of legacy thinking in the past, these days the speed at which technology is advancing, along with an increasing demand from consumers for unique experiences means there is no room for slow and stodgy decision making. What all of the companies in the examples above failed to grasp is that digital technologies have opened new sources of competitive advantage for businesses and that customer experience is key to this advantage, not the actual physical products.We might be slightly behind the curve in, but the trends following digital are no less relevant in South Africa. “The rate of change we are facing at the moment is faster than what it has ever been, and slower than what it will ever be. So buckle up,” says Chris Botha, Group Managing Director of Park Advertising. And if agencies don’t shift their mindsets from the tried and trusted, they will end up having to close their doors. “The reality for all industries is that we have to deal with technologies evolving, a different skill set expectation from people, consumer changing at a rapid pace, monetising problems, and global pressures all at once. So we all (and I mean all business) juggle these. We drop some balls, but the winners are the ones who drop the fewest.“Every single industry in the world is grappling with similar challenges. We just have a set that is particular to what we do,” Botha believes. In adapting to these challenges we need to understand that the stock market is now driven by Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google (FANG) stocks and that all industries, including the advertising and media industries, need to adapt their strategy by exploring how  best to build competitive advantage through consumer experience. Amazon did it by selling books online, even though these books were available in brick and mortar bookstores. Amazon improved customer experience by making a larger selection available to customers 24/7, as well as by offering the convenience of having the books delivered to their doors. Netflix has done the same by allowing on-demand screening of TV series and movies, without the need to visit a physical video store. Both employ algorithms to offer real-time recommendations of books and movies based on a person’s preferences and online history.“We’ve noticed considerable changes in the past decade in terms of how our readers want their content delivered. The same applies to how they receive brand information and advertising,” says Marise van der Lith, Brand Manager for Ads24. “The nature of the advertising, marketing and media industries has already changed, and will continue to change as AI and automation play an increasingly pivotal role. What’s important is that we (as an industry) remain flexible and responsive to the advantages that technology can offer, while retaining the values, empathy and intellect that only humans can offer.”Remember to follow Ads24 @Ads24_News.
