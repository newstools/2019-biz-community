The company is even failing to rollout digital transmitters across the country,” the source said.Addressing the media recently, TopStar vice president Cliff Sichone said the company is still young and has only been in Zambia for two years.He said while the company is “faring well” against increased competition and was growing according to targets, he acknowledged that revenue generation remains critical.Sichone said the company must reach the point where it will start generating sufficient revenue to sustain operations and repaying the loan. He added that the company has installed 65 digital transmitters, with only six remaining to conclude the installation process.“We are in the right trajectory and you can tell from the distribution of the network of transmitters. In comparison to players on the market, we have been disruptive in the sense that tradition TV has been changed, to a larger extent,” he said.TopStar is a joint venture between China’s StarTimes (60% shareholder) and the Zambia National Broadcasting Corporation (ZNBC) (40% shareholder).Source: NexTVAfrica.com.
