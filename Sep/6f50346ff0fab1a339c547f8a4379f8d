The Jacaranda FM presenters will be out in full force to entertain walkers, runners and those who just come through to enjoy the electric vibe before the prize giving.Good news for the little ones is that there will also be a kiddies’ area where tons of fun can be had.Those who attend are welcome to bring their own alcohol-free picnic baskets to enjoy after the walk, but a variety of food and drinks stalls will also be available to carb up and quench your thirst. “It’s quite a sight to see thousands of people from all over Gauteng and SA, and all walks of life, taking to the streets of Pretoria just as it starts to bloom with new life,” says Jacaranda FM’s General Manager, Kevin Fine. “Whether you’re a more serious runner or simply there to enjoy a leisurely walk in the company of your loved ones, spend time with the Jacaranda FM family and some of your other celebrity favourites, as well as being treated to stellar entertainment, this is THE way to get your favourite part of the year off to a great start.”“September marks the start of spring but is also Heart Awareness Month – making it the perfect time to start a simple, healthy habit like brisk walking,” says Discovery’s Head of Experiential Marketing, Iona Maclean. “Our sponsorship of this family-friendly walk aligns with Vitality’s global commitment to make 100 million people more physically active by 2025 – a goal that’s increasingly important given the rise in chronic diseases worldwide. Some of our own research has found that people who were not active but gradually increased physical activity had a 24% lower risk of death from any cause and we also see that exercise is a wonderful trigger for people undertaking other healthy behaviours. So we’re encouraging people of all ages and fitness levels to sign up for the Discovery Jacaranda Spring Walk, and enjoy this delightful outdoor event together.”Discovery Vitality members will be extra-pleased to know that they can claim Vitality fitness points for participating in the Spring Walk.
