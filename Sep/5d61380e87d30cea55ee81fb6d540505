His technology background made his shift into the leadership role a logical one after his predecessor, Adriaan Strydom, moved into a senior position within the Group.“Growth within the Group generally and South Africa in particular means we need to shift our organisational structure to ensure we are optimally positioned to support our clients and continue with our expansion strategy. Roan’s experience and vision aligns perfectly with our strategy of being a tech-first company. We have no doubt that this will benefit both local and international clients,” explains Jonathan Gluckman, Incubeta director and CEO of NMPi Asiapac and Africa. Mackintosh will remain at the Incubeta operational headquarters in Cape Town from which it serves brands across five continents. Over the past few months the Incubeta headcount has grown to nearly 400 digital professionals, serving more than 750 clients in over 14 markets.  “Our work with well-known international brands as well as our registered multi-region partnership with Google has given us an unparalleled ability to help local companies compete at a global level,” says Mackintosh. “We have invested heavily in training over the years and this is paying off when it comes to understanding and navigating the complexities of larger companies moving through the challenges of digital transformation.” Incubeta South Africa clients include Sanlam, Clicks, Old Mutual, Shoprite, Loot, Outsurance and Rain.
