It’s essential for retailers to understand what makes consumers tick, but also what their competitors may be doing differently to warrant shopper attention.”Survey methodologyA total sample of 2,750 respondents were surveyed in face-to-face interviews, across seven major metropolitan areas, as well as non-metropolitan areas across the country. Kantar used random suburb sampling among all racial groups, with an equal split of male and female adults aged 18 years and older. In order to arrive at the top retailers in SA, overall brand familiarity and awareness were measured alongside brand-user experiences and interactions, non-user perceptions, and brand presence in the market. The combined result of these factors, using a non-proprietary algorithm, produced the winning retailers.Category winnersShopper Survey CategoriesCategory WinnersFurniture StoresMr Price HomeHardware StoresCashbuild **Health and Beauty StoresClicks **Pharmaceutical OutletsClicks **Entertainment, Music and Book StoresMusicaMen's Clothing StoresMarkhamShoe StoresWoolworthsWomen's Clothing StoresMr PriceElectronics and Household Appliances StoresGame **WholesalersMakro **Home Accessories and Décor StoresMr Price Home **Grocery StoresShoprite **Jewellery StoresAmerican SwissTyre and Auto Fitment CentresTiger Wheel & Tyre **Liquor and Bottle StoresTops at Spar **Sports and Outdoor StoresTotalsports **Telecommunications StoresPEPcellKids and Baby Clothing StoresWoolworths **** Winner of category in 2018 as well.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/509021-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Credit: Pepkor" width="120" height="120">Pep, Truworths and Ackermans lead clothing retail customer satisfaction rankingsIn South Africa's fashion retail sector, Pep Stores and Truworths score the highest in terms of customer satisfaction...29 Jul 2019Top rankings in each category2019 Grand PrixIndex ScoreShoprite79.70Clicks77.93Pick n Pay (Supermarket/Hypermarket/Family store)77.38Makro77.08Tops at Spar71.10Spar/ Kwik Spar/ Super Spar69.87Mr Price69.78PEPcell69.12Woolworths68.96Cashbuild68.35Home Accessories and Décor StoresIndex ScoreMr Price Home67.13Sheet Street65.41Woolworths62.01Edgars Home58.95@ Home55.11Ackermans53.04Home Choice50.34Pep49.85Loads of Living49.32Electronics and Household Appliance StoresIndex ScoreGame65.23Clicks59.62Makro59.53House & Home56.67Samsung56.38Hi-Fi Corporation54.75Dion Wired54.31Checkers / Checkers Hyper54.29Pick n Pay53.95Shoprite53.21Jewellery StoresIndex ScoreAmerican Swiss66.57Sterns62.74Galaxy & Co.56.96Arthur Kaplan54.06NWJ Fine Jewellery49.74Browns49.63Takealot44.67Pandora42.04Narandas41.93Forma Viva40.29Kids and Baby Clothing StoresIndex ScoreWoolworths68.96Ackermans67.51Edgars63.99Naartjie60.10Mr Price59.71Truworths56.36Keedo55.53Jet55.17Earthchild54.38Pep53.26Liquor and Bottle StoresIndex ScoreTops at Spar71.10Shoprite Liquor Shop63.02Pick n Pay Liquor60.69Makro Liquor57.18Liquor City54.91Ultra Liquors52.47Checkers Liquor Shop51.67Overland Liquors48.68Liberty Liquors47.74Liquor World45.91Men's Clothing StoresIndex ScoreMarkham65.32Truworths64.63Edgars64.21Woolworths64.07Mr Price63.87Sportscene62.42Old Khaki58.05Studio 8855.10Guess54.39Ackermans52.61Shoe StoresIndex ScoreWoolworths68.81Edgars67.31Spitz64.04Timberland57.07Jet54.41Fabiani53.08Tekkie Town53.00Rage52.38Green Cross52.01Tread + Miller50.33Furniture StoresIndex ScoreMr Price Home59.31House & Home58.94Bradlows58.83Russells57.01Rochester56.86Lewis55.10Ok Furniture53.78Bed & Lounge53.14Fielli52.90Coricraft51.95Hardware StoresIndex ScoreCashbuild68.35Build it63.79Builders (including Warehouse, Express, Trade Depot)60.74Chamberlains50.42Jack's Paint & Hardware49.70Mica49.34BUCO49.11Timbercity48.73P&L Hardware47.68Jadas Hardware46.99Health and Beauty StoresIndex ScoreClicks77.93Dis-Chem68.32Edgars49.76Woolworths46.85Red Square46.49Foschini44.98The Body Shop44.97Truworths44.32Jet Mart39.66Wantitall38.56Pharmaceutical OutletsIndex ScoreClicks73.98Dis-Chem64.36Medirite (Shoprite/Checkers)57.94Link Pharmacy47.77Pick n Pay Pharmacy46.91Alpha Pharm46.76Spar Pharmacy38.96Sports and Outdoor StoresIndex ScoreTotalsports66.97Sportscene64.30Edgars Active59.66Adidas58.06Mr Price Sport57.62Nike57.22Studio 8853.86Cape Union Mart49.17The Cross Trainer47.58Sportsmans Warehouse47.47Telecommunications StoresIndex ScorePEPcell69.12Vodacom Store62.71MTN Store58.88Cell C Store53.29Telkom Stores52.91Game52.58Edgars51.61Ackermans49.28Woolworths48.48Pick n Pay47.06Tyre and Auto Fitment CentresIndex ScoreTiger Wheel & Tyre62.39Hi-Q58.54Supaquick56.55Dunlop Zone56.40Autozone54.83Speedy51.44Trentyre51.36Kwik Fit49.67Tyre Mart49.16BestDrive48.57WholesalersIndex ScoreMakro77.08Kit Kat Cash & Carry60.45Sunshine Cash & Carry49.91Jumbo Cash & Carry49.78Trade Centre49.29Metro Cash & Carry49.03Metro Hyper48.55Rhino Cash & Carry47.12Discount Cash & Carry46.80Women's Clothing StoresIndex ScoreMr Price69.78Woolworths67.94Edgars66.23Truworths65.27Sportscene60.80Guess59.10Ackermans57.62Foschini55.78Studio 8854.76Old Khaki54.23Entertainment, Music and Book StoresIndex ScoreMusica65.45CNA64.19Apple App Store57.56Exclusive Books53.67Netflix51.76Edgars51.53Van Schaik51.52Top CD50.30Checkers DVD/CD Section49.83Grocery StoresIndex ScoreShoprite79.70Pick n Pay77.38Spar/ Kwik Spar/ Super Spar69.87Checkers/ Checkers Hyper66.59Woolworths63.40Makro56.23Fruit & Veg City54.83Boxer50.80Game (Foodco)49.62Cambridge Foods45.73The complete results of the 2019 Sunday Times/Sowetan Shopper Survey will be published in a supplement accompanying the Sunday Times on 8 September 2019.
