Africa has the youngest population demographic across all the continents, with an estimated 60% aged under 21. However, Africa’s youth continue to face the prospect of unemployment and poverty. The African Development Bank noted that 12 million young people entered the African labour market in 2015, but only 3.1 million jobs were created. Annan states that 22,000 young Africans join the unemployed ranks every 24 hours, which has led to him founding an organisation called Africa10 (A10) to help unlock the potential of Africa’s youth through sport and education. “It's time to turn our large youthful unemployed population into our strength. We have to equip them, educate them, and unleash them,” he said. “It is time to realise we are the village that must raise the child.” In her opening address for Africa Week, Murdoch University Vice Chancellor Professor Eeva Leinonen pressed the importance of collaboration in reaching shared global goals. “It is only through researching together that we can create new knowledge and address issues of global importance,” Professor Leinonen said. “Through initiatives like Africa Down Under and the Africa-Australia Research Forum we can better understand the effective structures that harness the formidable African brain power globally.”
