The designs that were pitched gave us a peek at the developing product design landscape informing the contemporary South African furniture and lighting design aesthetic. One can’t resist the feeling that the South African aesthetic is being redefined, not only for locals with a taste for the vernacular in contemporary design, but for a global marketplace that is ready to see African craft and design beyond the curio.”
