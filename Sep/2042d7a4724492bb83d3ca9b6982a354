Twitter users were quick to share their thoughts and sentiments on how well Zara, a global fashion brand, executed their campaign through the use of micro-influencers, who generally have a lower number of followers but higher engagement rates.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517380.jpg" alt="Zara's #DearSouthAfrica micro-influencer campaign floods social media" width="600" height="405"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517381.jpg" alt="Zara's #DearSouthAfrica micro-influencer campaign floods social media" width="600" height="370"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517382.jpg" alt="Zara's #DearSouthAfrica micro-influencer campaign floods social media" width="600" height="353">As Meltwater monitored online conversations by location, the African heat map below indicates that South Africa was yet again the number one country talking about the Zara campaign, with 94.07% of all mentions coming from South Africa. Cameroon comes in second at 1.04% followed by Nigeria at 0.97%.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517383.jpg" alt="Zara's #DearSouthAfrica micro-influencer campaign floods social media" width="600" height="405">According to Meltwater, if there is one thing that the Zara online store campaign proved, it’s that micro-influencers hold significant power when it comes to influencer marketing. Because these influencers are known to have higher engagement rates, using a social media platform, such as Twitter, worked well for the Zara campaign. Not only was Twitter the top social media platform in South Africa for this campaign, but the social reach the day before the official store opening peaked at 42.3M people. On the day of the launch, social reach was 12.3M people.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517384.jpg" alt="Zara's #DearSouthAfrica micro-influencer campaign floods social media" width="600" height="385"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517385.jpg" alt="Zara's #DearSouthAfrica micro-influencer campaign floods social media" width="600" height="420">As a result, not only did the Zara campaign create hype that reached further than our borders, but the overall online conversations were positive towards Zara and their online store campaign. 68.1% of all online social media mentions with the words ‘Zara’, ‘online’ and ‘South Africa’ were positive, while only 17.8% were negative, and mainly referred to social posts on why Zara chose to work with more micro-influencers for this campaign.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517386.jpg" alt="Zara's #DearSouthAfrica micro-influencer campaign floods social media" width="600" height="411"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517390.jpg" alt="Zara's #DearSouthAfrica micro-influencer campaign floods social media" width="600" height="323"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517392.jpg" alt="Zara's #DearSouthAfrica micro-influencer campaign floods social media" width="600" height="293"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517393.jpg" alt="Zara's #DearSouthAfrica micro-influencer campaign floods social media" width="600" height="288">Social media and feature image via Tlego28.
