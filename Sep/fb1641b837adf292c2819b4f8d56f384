It was a $1.7 billion industry in 2016 and is expected to continue its upward trajectory this year to potentially become a $6.5 billion industry.Celebrities value and understand the importance of ongoing fan interaction and have limited channels to effectively engage fans on platforms that don't encroach on their privacy. The myFanPark platform provides a smart solution that allows the consumer and celebrity to interact in a novel way like never before.myFanPark was founded by entrepreneurs Wouter Lombard, Dylan and Joy Des Fountain and former Springbok captain Jean de Villiers. The team launched myFanPark in 2019, after realising that there is a massive gap in the market. “myFanPark lets you request a personalised video message for any occasion from - for words of encouragement, inspiration, big announcements to special celebrations. The possibilities for these videos are endless” explains Lombard.You can send a message of encouragement to your boy on his first rugby match from Springboks Eben Etzebeth and Faf de Klerk or if you need to give someone a laugh, how about asking comedians Schalk Bezuidenhout or Casper de Vries to make it happen.Best of all, no video will ever be the same, as each and every video will be personalised by the celebrity and recorded especially for the fan once the celebrity receives the request. Each celebrity charges their own rate and prices start at R200 per video. myFanPark will also be donating a portion of proceeds from each video to The Red Cross Children’s Hospital Trust or the Laureus Sport for Good Foundation.The myFanPark website already features over 100 celebrities, ranging from sports stars like Springbok Jesse Kriel and EFC fighter Demarte Pena, to musicians like Ard Matthews, Francois van Coke, Gigi Lamayne, Bok van Blerk, Elvis Blue and Brendan Peyper.
