Via a series of mini-case studies, we will share interesting insights gleaned from Brand Atlas 5 about the benefits of having clearly defined and targeted consumer groups. These workshops will be of interest to marketers from all disciplines – brand managers, media planners, account managers, strategic planners, insights managers, market researchers, consultants and data managers alike. The workshops will be informal and conversational.  We will encourage discussion and debate around the different approaches to defining customer segments and the problems experienced with trying to reach them and influence their behaviours. If you can’t personally attend, please nominate someone to come in your place, and we will invite them directly. If you like to come and want to bring along other people, please let us know and will try to accommodate them.
