Spark Media’s CEO, Gill Randall, says: “We are so grateful to every person that made an effort to attend our annual Sports Day. It’s a small token of thanks from us to our clients and agency partners that was once again so incredibly well received. Our aim is to continue to build meaningful connections with clients far from the pressures of the office in a completely relaxed environment.”For golf lovers, prime fairways served as the ideal way to converse with friends, de-stress and, of course, time those drives to perfection. For those less inclined to traverse the greens, the Fun-a-Thon offered plenty amusement and more than just a few challenging tasks.The mental workout of the afternoon quiz also formed an integral part of the day, and provided guests and Spark Media staff with the chance to test their general knowledge and show off their intellectual prowess.Spark Media’s Director of Sales, Olav Westphal, added: “We put a significant amount of effort into the Sports Day, but its success depends entirely on our clients. The day couldn’t work without their enthusiasm and positive mindsets. Spark Media has a vibrant culture, and much of it is as a result of what clients bring to the table. They play a crucial role in the development of Spark’s can-do personality, and for this we thank them.”Although the 2019 edition of the Spark Media Sports Day has come and gone, next year promises to be an event worth pencilling into calendars as early as possible.“We’d like to thank everyone who participated in the raffle,” says Gill. “We managed to raise R5,600 for our longstanding charity, Hayani, which runs both a much-needed crèche in Alexandra and an orphanage in Orange Grove. We look forward to seeing you all in 2020.”
