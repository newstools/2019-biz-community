In the Art ComPETition, artists and designers were given a basic wooden bed to create a one-of-a-kind design using paint, mosaic, collage, metal, pewter, or any other medium. The Textile Design ComPETition offered fabric and surface designers the opportunity to create striking pet-themed prints. The entries from the top 15 finalists in each category were displayed at the Cape Town Homemakers Expo. Judged by an independent panel, the winners in each of the three categories walk away with a cash prize of R10,000, with second place receiving R5,000 and third R3,000, totaling R54,000 in prize monies.
