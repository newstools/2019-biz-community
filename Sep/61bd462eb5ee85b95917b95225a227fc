Over the past three years, the Brands in Motion study has surveyed nearly 80,000 consumers and B2B decision-makers to understand the impact of market forces and quantify how perception shifts are impacted by them over time. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516444-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Joyce McCown on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">How to be brave, brandsWGSN's 2019 report on brands and marketing touched on everything from the power of collaboration to meaningful content and the importance of authenticity - it also highlighted the rise of 'brave brands'...By Lynette Botha 13 Sep 2019This year’s study exposed three main themes:High expectations With greater choice and knowledge at their fingertips, consumers are more empowered than ever to make demands of brands. We see this playing out on several fronts – from climate change to data privacy. Today’s consumer uprising is also reflected in the Brands in Motion study results: Since its inception, not a single global consumer expectation has decreased. “South African consumers have an extremely high expectation of brands. Brands today face a high-stakes environment – insatiable expectations, a push for accountability from all sides, and a consumer audience that has unprecedented levels of customisation, knowledge and choice at their fingertips,” said WE South Africa general manager James Wilson. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/508759-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Coca-Cola Company." width="120" height="120">Fortune favours brave(r) brandsWith so many conservative groups lobbying against the LGBTQ+ community, only big brands can be brave enough to not injure their market share or upset their loyal conservatives, right?...By Arisha Saroop 26 Jul 2019Nuanced needsThis year’s Brands in Motion study delved deeper into consumer expectations when it comes to technology.

The ethics of technology remains front and centre with 97% (90% in South Africa) agreeing that companies are responsible for using technology ethically, and 92% saying they would stop using a product or service if it was using consumer data unethically.New, this year, was a call for collective accountability, with 96% (South Africa 99%) acknowledging that it’s not just up to brands and the government.

That means leading with purpose, building new levels of trust and respect with customers, and creating a more meaningful impact in the way a brand operates globally and locally. Some companies like those that supported the Business Roundtable commitment, are further reinforcing the need to deliver social impact over shareholder value. “Purpose is why you do what you do,” said Wilson. “What’s changed now is that it has to go so much deeper than corporate social responsibility. You can’t just talk about it – your brand has to live it.”For consumers, that means creating a tangible impact. At least 54% (South Africa 52%) say they want the brands they support to balance a great product with powerful purpose and activism, and 53% (South Africa 56%) want brands to address environmental problems in both local communities and at a global level. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/514426-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Loeries2019: Bringing the value of purpose-led work to the world through creative product" width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: Bringing the value of purpose-led work to the world through creative productFor the second year running, Joe Public United was recognised as Agency of the Year at the Loeries...By Juanita Pienaar 2 Sep 2019Other WE research released, earlier this year, showed similar urgency, pointing to the environment, the need for greater equality and politics as critical challenges facing a society where brands have an opportunity to be a part of the solution. By leading with purpose and through thoughtful listening, commitment and bravery, brands have an opportunity to create positive change and a lasting legacy.   “Last year, we said expectations are higher than ever. You had to balance ethics and innovation, and show, not tell, consumers your value,” said Wilson.“This year, consumers are demanding that you do all that and speak your truth as a brand at the same time. In addition to a great product, they expect authenticity and they expect respect – they want brands to show they are human to the core.”
