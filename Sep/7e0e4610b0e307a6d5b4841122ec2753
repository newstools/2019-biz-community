The issue with this is that app developers are prone to focusing more on the quantity of clicks, at the expense of the user experience. "Advertisers should be asking why users do not feel as comfortable converting on mobile as they do on desktop? Are mobile ad clicks sending the right sort of traffic? Is my mobile ad spend driving real value for my bottom line?”SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1804/435886-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Mobile and social are dominant forces in SA retail" width="120" height="120">Mobile and social are dominant forces in SA retailVirtual shopping is becoming the norm.

The more spammy and irritating ads are on an app, the less the propensity someone will trust the companies advertising.Divecha concluded with four tips for advertisers who use mobile as part of their marketing: “Advertisers need to be wary of tracking mobile clicks alone as a primary KPI. They need to ensure mobile clicks are generating value and that they have the right attribution data in place to be able to record such value.”SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497512.jpg" alt="Gen Z: How is business responding to a generation who prefers loyalty to novelty?" width="120" height="120">Gen Z: How is business responding to a generation who prefers loyalty to novelty?There are new kids on the block.

You should then add this list of site visitors to a remarketing campaign, reminding them to convert. Keep track of low-quality apps – those that bring lots of traffic but no conversions – and block these apps from your campaign. Try different variations of ad formats and try to avoid formats that could lead to accidental clicks i.e. larger banners near a small action button.
