Image supplied.Badiel-Liberty is a Burkinabé model and was Miss Burkina Faso in 2003 and Miss Africa 2004. Shortly after being crowned Miss Africa, she began her modelling career in Paris, France. Her client list includes Louis Vuitton, Marc Jacobs, Lanvin, Zan Toi and Dianne von Furstenberg. She has also been featured in Russian and Italian Vogue, Marie Claire, GQ, Essence, among other publications. Her modelling career eventually brought her to New York City where she began using her platform to take on the issue of the lack of potable drinking water in her West African homeland. She runs the Georgie Badiel Foundation, which is dedicated to building and restoring wells in Burkina Faso and Liberia. To date, the Georgie Badiel Foundation has provided access to water for over 270,000 people who previously suffered from water scarcity. She has also co-authored the book The Water Princess published in 2016.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1802/428406-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Scenes from the #2minuteshowersongs and #weewiser campaigns." width="120" height="120">Campaigning to #DefeatDayZeroThe phrases 'water crisis', 'drought' and 'day zero' have been taking up headline space consistently for the past few months.

First and foremost, I've missed this place. I actually lived in Cape Town for a short stint while modelling. Second, I'm excited to have such a large platform to talk through the world's water crisis. I was really excited to learn from the amazing group that Doha Debates curated. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516361.jpg" alt="Georgie Badiel interviewed on eNCA set.

In fact, it takes private and public sector generosity coupled with amazing on-the-ground partners to implement these projects in tough environments like Liberia and Burkina Faso, where I'm from. Unlike so many problems we face right now, water is solvable.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/460295-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#BI4Gov: Why Day Zero was less nudge effect, more kick-in-the-butt effect" width="120" height="120">#BI4Gov: Why Day Zero was less nudge effect, more kick-in-the-butt effectEver wondered how nudges turn into true behavioural change that benefits society?

That is not the case for me. I grew up having to walk 3.5 hours for water, some days. I grew up using water for laundry and baths that caused rashes – which I wouldn't be caught using for anything today. Luckily, I had a special talent and was able to use modelling to get me out of that situation. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1803/432221-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cape Town reduces water consumption by 60% in three years" width="120" height="120">Cape Town reduces water consumption by 60% in three yearsThe City of Cape Town is currently using 516-million litres of water per day, according to its latest data release.

In terms of my experience modelling, a big part of running a foundation is fundraising and modelling definitely has helped me understand branding and how to sell things. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490716-120x120.jpg?2" alt="What Cape Town's drought can teach other cities about climate adaptation" width="120" height="120">What Cape Town's drought can teach other cities about climate adaptationExtreme weather events, such as Cyclone Idai that has recently devastated Beira, Mozambique, and Hurricane Harvey that hit Houston, USA, in 2017 are the types of climate extremes that cities increasingly have to prepare for...By Gina Ziervogel 4 Apr 2019So, basically, I know the problem – intimately.

Right now, we have a huge data project we are working on. Basically, we are mapping every well in Burkina Faso (broken or operational) and then linking it with population data. This is the beginnings of our research that will help get 100% of Burkina Faso residents access to clean drinking water.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/493387-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Mozambique water project: insights into supply and use in a peri-urban area" width="120" height="120">Mozambique water project: insights into supply and use in a peri-urban areaThe United Nations reports that water scarcity affects more than 40% of the global population.

She is such an inspiration to me. That got me interested in Liberian history and politics, so I've started She Would Be King, the debut novel by Wayetu Moore (who is actually my husband's cousin). It's a fascinating magical realism novel – which takes place in colonial Liberia. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us something about yourself not generally known?Cooking is among my biggest passions.
