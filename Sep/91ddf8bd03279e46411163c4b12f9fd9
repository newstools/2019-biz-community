Ogilvy and THB will continue to retain their own distinct identities in the new space, with separate office areas and independent servers to ensure client confidentiality. The new co-location will also allow the two businesses to work collaboratively to provide an integrated team solution centred around clients’ needs when required. “WPP co-location enables greater efficiencies in amazing workspaces, streamlining operations and enabling greater creativity which can be passed on to clients,” said Ogilvy Durban MD John Gale. “We will function as separate agencies and enjoy a healthy competitive spirit, but when the need arises, we can combine our resources to provide a compelling service – as we’ve done already for clients like Unilever.” “Co-locating in modern working environments gives our people the space to create and makes our service far more efficient and effective for the benefit of our clients,” said Sue Napier, MD of The Hardy Boys. “It allows the WPP Durban Network to provide swift, integrated solutions, world-class creativity and technology without compromise. We’re really excited about this new adventure.”
