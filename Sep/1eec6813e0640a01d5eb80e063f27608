Comprising scarves, pocket squares, bandanas and leather bags, the new range was showcased recently in South Africa at the FNB Art Joburg, which took place from 13-15 September 2019 in Johannesburg.  The designs that give The Lalela Scarf such universal appeal are created using Lalela learners' original artworks. New York-based creative director Sandy Tabatznik curates each seasonal collection of scarves by drawing on stand-out paintings and then adapting their format.Arts education<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/518128.jpg" alt="The Lalela Scarf: luxury fashion for a cause" width="310" height="517">The fashion accessory was first conceived as a means of funding Lalela but has grown into a stand-alone luxury brand in its own right and is a member of the Positive Luxury Brand, which includes other top-tier brands such as Louis Vuitton. Research shows that arts education improves the lives of students, increasing their academic, social, mental and economic wellbeing over a long-term period. "Lalela provides educational arts to at-risk youth to spark creative thinking and awaken the entrepreneurial spirit," Tabatznik explains. The organisation teaches children how to map and manifest their goals, launching the possibility of a different future for themselves and their communities. From grade 1 to grade 12, Lalela connects arts to everything important in a child's life, from core academics to critical life skills. Meaningful engagement“I am deeply humbled by the impact our fashion items are having on our customers – the feedback from the market is phenomenal! People respond immediately to the visual appeal of the designs themselves, but also to what they are about and where they come from – there’s a deeper and meaningful engagement with the narratives behind the artworks,” says Tabatznik. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/508040-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Luxury fashion brands are making a splash in the art world" width="120" height="120">Luxury fashion brands are making a splash in the art worldLouis Vuitton reopened its refurbished flagship store in Florence in March 2019 to great fanfare from the fashion industry.
