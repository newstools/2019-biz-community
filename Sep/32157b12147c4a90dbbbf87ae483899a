It was Bono who said: "It's not the answers we get wrong, it's the questions."Start with whySimon Sinek and many other gurus coined this concept. Not because it rolls off the tongue easily or because it's a cool tagline, but because it works.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506752-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Crew on Unsplash" width="120" height="120">From product to customer-centricity - how CX gives business the edgeCustomer experience has moved from a nice-to-have to a need-to-have as a way to distinguish a business from its competitors...By Johan Lewies 19 Jul 2019The first question when engaging with a customer, whether it be new or repeat business, should be why. In our industry, it's understanding why they are hosting an event, why that particular audience, why is it important to their brand and what are the event objectives. What experience do they want to their customers to enjoy?You see, we serve our customers' customer ultimately. Most events are for the enjoyment of an audience that we won't deal directly with, but our customers do, so ask them.It's too easy for us to tell customers what we think they want their event to be or to copy and past from last years' event because it was great.

While we may enjoy tasting them all, by the time we get to the end, the choice is too vast to make a decision. And so we walk away empty-handed.However, when offered two or three varieties, it makes a decision easier and usually ends in a purchase. Studies prove that a small array of choice yields quick decisions.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/512186-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Prevent poor customer service from killing your brand" width="120" height="120">Prevent poor customer service from killing your brandSA businesses are faced with a difficult task.
