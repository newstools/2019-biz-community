"I'm in a unique space where I have developed both a strong arts and business background. I would love to use my time on the board to grow practical plans where artists grow not only their art but their business skills too." An MBA graduate and an honorary member of the Golden Key International Honour Society, Govender is well-known across the African continent, and has spent the past 26 years actively working on various media platforms including television, radio, print and online. "It is a truly an honour to have been appointed to the board of BASA," said Berman, CEO of Space Consulting. Berman has an extensive background in the creative and cultural industries. Her experience over the past two decades, as a practitioner, critic, marketer, board member, trainer, mentor, and coach, has been supplemented by many years in consulting in all sectors. "At a time when South Africa, and the world, transitions to meet the needs of a new digital century, when sciences, technology, and the cultural sectors have begun to work interdependently, BASA plays a pivotal role in connecting the wealth of our artistic, cultural and creative communities to business."Baffoe has been formally associated with BASA for seven years as a member of the annual BASA Awards judging panel, and he has chaired the panel for the last two years. Baffoe said he is honoured to be appointed to the BASA Board, and that he does not take the responsibility lightly: "The private sector has as important a role to play as the public sector in the development of the arts. I am looking forward to continuing to contribute to the partnership between the business world and the arts, beyond the work I have done on the BASA Awards judging committee." An entrepreneur, writer, facilitator, content architect, former magazine editor, former radio talk show host and speaker, he has worked in and runs businesses in a range of sectors including retail, management consulting, publishing, events, IT and media (including television and print).
