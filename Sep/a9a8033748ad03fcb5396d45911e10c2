Rowlands said, “In light of the last few days, my legacy pales in significance to the legacies of the women who have recently lost their lives. We at Dentsu Aegis Network (DAN) are formulating a plan to ensure that women in South Africa and across the continent have a voice.”  DAN also celebrates Phumi Masango who won the Shear Learning Award. Masango said, “I am truly grateful for this award. I appreciate industries choice in recognising and prioritising the upskilling of young people. My ambition is to pay this forward by assisting future young people in media. It’s an honour to be a part of the DAN family and a special high-five to Celia Collins for constantly pushing me to be better." Posterscope SA took second place in the Specialist Media Agency category and Carat Cape Town came in third place for the Media Agency Lamb Award. Koo Govender congratulated Dawn and the DAN team by saying, “I am so proud of my DAN Team. Well Done! Dawn’s award last night was an inspiration to me personally and I could not think of anyone more deserving of the Media Legend award. Onwards and upwards team, let the success continue. “Inspiration is one thing and you can't control it, but hard work is what keeps the ship moving. Good luck means, work hard. Keep up the good work. - Kevin Eubanks”
