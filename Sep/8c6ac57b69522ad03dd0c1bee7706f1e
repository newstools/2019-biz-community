Announced at a Humanz event last night in JHB, RebelRebel has been appointed to oversee media and data sales within the South African market. “We’ve been driving innovation and technology throughout our careers, but this platform exceeds everyones expectations. Humanz has been received with great voracity in the SA market, exposing a need for an influencer platform that not only performs the functional task of identification, but handles the entire process from end-to-end… it’s really on another level,” says Mike Carter, commercial partner at RebelRebel.Humanz is a disruptive social data verification and enhancement business, which uses artificial intelligence, machine learning, image recognition and natural language processing to analyse publicly available information, the same way humans would, to provide an alternative, more accurate version of the truth found inside social data. Humanz' first commercial application is an influencer marketing platform which allows advertisers to search for potential influencers, vet their audience for fraud, manage collaborations with content creators, forecast their performance and audit the results, while tying them back to actual ROI and sales.“When you can demo the platform in-front of major brands and agencies, and they get the power immediately, you’ve got your yard stick. There is some serious proprietary tech powering Humanz, and it sits behind a very intuitive UI… we are incredibly excited to be partnered with such an amazing team,” adds Shauna Carter, operations and sales partner for the new company.Humanz has already been active in the market for three months and experiencing tremendous success, but sought the expertise of a sound sales team to accelerate awareness and adoption of the tool in the South African market. Marketers and agencies can partner with Humanz as a fully outsourced managed services solution for individual campaigns, or enter into long-term partnerships to be trained into using its technology and data.“As a start-up on a phenomenal growth trajectory, we know the importance of building a team filled with talent, drive and urgency. We are very excited to be partnering with RebelRebel, whom we believe exemplify these values, and contribute to their growth as they contribute to ours. Their understanding of data-driven performance media is a huge asset to us given our focus on making influencer marketing as predictable a part of the marketing funnel as other media channels.” concludes Pierre Cassuto, global CMO and SSA CEO for Humanz.
