Driven by our mission to care for people, society and the planet, we believe that the Waste Management Coalition displays these values across their campaign and are most deserving of the accolade.”The Toxic Flag campaign used a large scale art installation to make a powerful statement about the possibility of building harmful incinerators to tackle the major garbage crisis that has plagued Lebanon for almost half a decade, a plan that would adversely affect the environment, increase pollution drastically and put the lives and well-being of the Lebanese people at risk.Accepting on behalf of Impact BBDO Dubai, the agency’s Executive Arabic Creative Copywriter and 2019 Loeries judge, Sarah Berro, explained that the campaign sought to make an invisible danger visible to the people of Lebanon. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515101.jpg" alt="Loeries 2019 Dove Public Service Award goes to the Toxic Flag in Lebanon" width="625" height="443">Inspired by the sculptures of Irish artist John Gerrard, the agency created a Toxic Flag that could be seen from across Beirut – a 35-metre high art installation that spewed black smoke into the sky. While the smoke was non-toxic and environmentally friendly, it gave the people who would be affected by the building of real garbage incinerators a glimpse of their future. This immediately sparked the conversation in Lebanese households about alternate and safer options for garbage disposal. “Handing over an award of this calibre resonates with Dove because our consumers and societies within which we operate are calling on us to make a change,” said Njapha. “Dove recognises this and therefore why it is important for brands to go beyond just talking about issues, and actually taking action – only brands with purpose can truly achieve this.” The 2019 Loerie Awards were announced during Creative Week in Durban on 23 and 24 August.
