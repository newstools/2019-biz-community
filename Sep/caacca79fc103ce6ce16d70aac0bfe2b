Refilwe is warm, charismatic and versatile,” said Tessa Van Staden, CapeTalk station manager in a press release recently published on Bizcommunity.We caught up with Moloto who talked to us about her new role, how she feels about it and what excites her most about the station and where it's going..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Congratulations on your appointment. How does it feel taking over from Kieno Kammies?It’s been exciting getting to know a broader range of Cape Talk’s listeners.

I’m most excited about this relaunch – the leadership has done extensive work on audience research and hearing what they want to talk about with whom and we’re a nimble broadcaster that is reflecting that demand in the changes you see. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about your career in finance and now radio?That I can excel at both and continue to participate in both. It’s a big part of my beliefs that we aren’t singular in our talents, interests and areas where we can deliver excellence and that forms a central tenet of my personal brand and advocacy: there is room and demand for performative skill in “pure” finance, in as much as talk radio – and broadcasting – has long had a need for analytical depth to elevate discourse for maximum impact..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What did it take to get to where you are today?Curiosity, perseverance and a sense of humour.Things you didn’t know about Refilwe Moloto the new Cape Talk Breakfast Show ...
