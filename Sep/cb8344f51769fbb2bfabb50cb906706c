It is our focus on remaining differentiated, useful and modern – and always putting our clients first, that keeps us South Africa’s most valuable brand,” she says.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513795-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Standard Bank targets informal retail economy with $4m Nomanini investment" width="120" height="120">Standard Bank targets informal retail economy with $4m Nomanini investmentStandard Bank has gained a stake in Nomanini following an investment of $4m.

Since we launched the first non-alcoholic beer into the market, numerous other offers have entered the market, but we were the first and are the market leader and we are very proud of that,” he adds.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1710/416506-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Vaughan Croeser, brand director, Castle Lager; Andrea Quaye, vice president of marketing Africa and Ricardo Tadeu, AB InBev president Africa." width="120" height="120">#FreshOnTheShelf: SAB and AB InBev launch locally-brewed alcohol-free beerIn an effort to encourage responsible drinking, SAB and AB InBev Africa have introduced Castle Free, an alcohol-free beer brewed in South Africa...30 Oct 2017Castle Free is an example of the brand’s ability to stay true to its legacy and its purpose but not being afraid to innovate. “We force ourselves to be at the forefront of innovation –whether in our own category of beverages or adjacent categories such as licensing, merchandising, apparel and technology,” he explains.The brand’s newest campaign, Heartbeat of the Nation, is an example of this thinking. “By using technology never used before we can measure the country’s heartbeat while our nation’s sports teams are playing.
