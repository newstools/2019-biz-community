As the largest exchange in Africa, the JSE is at the centre of African finance, but Newton-King has also brought her passion for social responsibility into the mix, as she was part of the team that developed the JSE’s Socially Responsible Investment Index – the first index of its kind globally. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/478532-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The importance of good environmental, social and governance practices" width="120" height="120">The importance of good environmental, social and governance practicesThe JSE is one of five exchanges in the world to be internationally recognised as a pioneer of a global initiative to enhance corporate transparency, performance on environmental, social and corporate governance...By Shameela Soobramoney 21 Jan 2019On the role of tech in business, Scholtz asked about the JSE’s experience, to which Newton-King replied that the JSE is a critical part of the SA economy, with tech at the heart of that. It has to work continuously without moments of fault, as billions have been invested in it. There’s zero fault tolerance and the JSE’s core technology is seen as ‘weapons-grade’.She also spoke of a program that was in development for eight years and had to be cancelled despite the R400m investment up to that point as it just wasn’t getting over the line. Newton-King says the JSE also took the time for some introspection into “what else in our IT real estate wasn’t world-class, including the people and regulatory standards.”Being brave, being fastAs there has major innovation in digital transformation, most laptops don’t last more than 18 months these days. Similarly, Newton-King says we have to be brave in developing technology. Lots of tech is a hygiene factor for basic operations, but some tech is what moves your business forward faster, into new frontiers. Newton-King admitted that the JSE is a user rather than developer of tech, but would love to be an innovator, too. She said the biggest risk in tech investment is that it takes so long to decide what you want to do, as the winds of change are so vicious, turbulent and fast. We spend so much time, money and energy to develop, yet low-cost innovators are coming up along the sides. Taking three years to develop ‘something new’ now means you are 2.5 years too slow, and just playing catch up. Sharing her thoughts on the impact of new technology like AI and machine learning, Newton-King says we need to be at the top end of the wave of everything. Those who are worried about the impact of robotics are missing the point. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/518282-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Woodward presenting at Gartner Symposium 2019." width="120" height="120">#GartnerSYM: AI (Artificial Ignorance) mistakes to avoidWhile Artificial Intelligence or AI continues to make tech headlines for innovative new products and their impact in the workplace, as with most emerging fields, AI has also encountered several noteworthy growing pains.

Newton-King says this is about doubling down on early-stage competence rather than waiting to solve it all amongst the grey-haired contingent.Switching focus to social responsibility and what went into establishing the indices, Newton-King says ‘the top of the Christmas tree’ shouldn’t get all the benefits of business. We extract value from society in the charges levied on clients to pay taxes, which get distributed amongst the executives in the ultimate capitalist way. Rethinking the way we do business is at the heart of the indices.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/486988-120x120.jpg?2" alt="YPO member James Barty - also ACA chairperson and CEO of King James Group." width="120" height="120">#YPOEdge: James Barty on brand humanity and doing good business, beyond ticking the 'CSI box'Leigh Andrews speaks to King James founder and YPO member James Barty about what he gains from his involvement in YPO and how all businesses can make a better impact...By Leigh Andrews 14 Mar 2019Newton-King was applauded and cheered by attendees when she asked:Will an extra million really benefit the top-level executive?

The JSE’s Socially Responsible Investment Index first started 18 years ago, and while investors have been slow to reward business for using the indices, doing so is now seen as a measure of discussion.Newton-King says the likes of Unilever’s Paul Polman are leading the international conversation on socially responsible behaviour.That’s not to say that the status of corporate social responsibility or CSR in SA is quite high, as it’s proven significant support to external stakeholders, especially with the state struggling to provide full services.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496415-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty" width="120" height="120">How marketing with CSR at its heart can change the worldFitting in perfectly with the rise of purpose-led marketing across the globe is Jeanne du Plessis, corporate affairs and citizenship leader at Procter and Gamble (P&G) South Africa.

Our wobbly economy requires us to lean in and leaders need to do what they can to help the country move on rather than just sit and wait. In this regard, the JSE has been involved in a number of marches for social equality.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515505-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Trending images relating to the #AmINext hashtag and the much-shared pic of the protest march outside Parliament on 5 September 2019: ." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Stepping up to keep SA's females safeLocal media covered the general sense of unrest and discomfort in the country last week, following the spate of femicide cases that spurred the nation to say #Enoughisenough and ask #AmInext?

The first is a form of ‘tea leaf-reading’, done with the team to determine where you are going and then guiding the larger whole, while the other is essentially cheerleading, so the team realises that it’s possible to do what you need to do even when times are tough.The importance of returning to SA with different skillsNewton-King is also big on providing mentorship and lessons to those who come after us. Her successor at the JSE is Dr Leila Fourie, graduate of the Australian Institute of Company Directors and previously an executive director of the JSE, who is returning to SA to step into the role as group chief executive officer, effective 1 October 2019. “We are all as good as our training and experience, and should test ourselves in other spaces.” Newton-King said she is stepping down after 23 years at the JSE as staying for too long effectively means chasing out the space for others. Her heart bleeds when she sees how many are looking for experiences outside SA, as skills are needed here.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1608/355732-120x120.jpg?2" alt="JSE CEO, Nicky Newton-King, Cape Town mayor, Patricia de Lille, and JSE chairperson, Nonkululeko Nyembezi-Heita, at the opening of the JSE Exchange Hub Cape Town." width="120" height="120">JSE opens satellite office in Cape TownThe JSE Exchange Hub Cape Town, which was launched on 12 August, is part of the exchange's strategy to enhance its service to clients in the city and build new relationships...By Nicci Botha 15 Aug 2016When someone does so and comes back to SA, as Fourie is doing, Newton-King says they bring with them a wealth of experience from different cultural exposures and stages of development elsewhere. She says to make a difference to the lived experience of the country where you can. We have the space to make a lasting difference locally. Deliver what you say you will do on time, on budget, and be brave enough to speak truth to power, as that’s the essence of leadership.
