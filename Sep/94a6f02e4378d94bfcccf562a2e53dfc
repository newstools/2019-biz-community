The image was shared on a public display screen, which brings in the concept of privacy and use of personal data, but the bigger issue is that her face was printed on the side of a moving bus at the time. So yes, Mingzhu’s face was technically ‘in the middle of the road’, but the president of China's biggest air conditioning maker wasn’t physically there. The technology had to be corrected, as a result.Virtual voice assistance voidWoodward also spoke of the rise in voice search but mentioned AI can still go awry in this regard, especially in the case of smart devices taking input from voices on the TV or even children. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/467189.jpg" alt="Artificial Intelligence: It's in your home" width="120" height="120">Artificial Intelligence: It's in your homeArtificial intelligence is far more accessible than you'd ever believe...By Joanne Weng 7 Nov 2018The robots are coming… but they’re not quite ready for usA common 4IR fear is that robots will take our jobs. While this may be true of those roles that are more easily automated, there’s much to be said for what humans bring to the world of work. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/468033.jpg" alt="Human touch is the strongest element in AI" width="120" height="120">Human touch is the strongest element in AICIOs need to prepare workers for a future in which people do more creative and impactful work because they no longer have to perform many routine and repetitive tasks...9 Nov 2018Woodward said that a batch of robots had already been hired and swiftly fired as assistants at Japan’s Henn na Hotel, as they were both annoying and incompetent.The velociraptor-type robots had difficulty making photocopies when helping at the concierge desk, while the in-room voice assistants would ask “how can I help” when hearing snoring in hotel rooms.And of course, one of the main differences in human and artificial decision-making is that we factor in aspects of the context that may have been left out of the AI programming. Diversity and bias play a role in AIFor example, Woodward said that a robotic passport checker rejected an Asian man’s photo as it thought his eyes were closed. This implies that there was a lack of diverse data fed into to program in order to be applicable to a diverse population.There was similar diversity bias in Amazon’s AI recruitment tool, which processed the CVs or resumes of the people the company had already hired and was asked to ‘find similar’. Unfortunately, the program was found to not be accepting female applicants’ resumes – bias had mistakenly entered the process, hopefully by mistake, so while a good idea in concept, many lost trust in the process and the program was scrapped.There have also been cases of facial personality analytics startups claiming to predict personality attributes and even IQ, and another AI program detecting sexual orientation – both just from photos of faces.These examples are both quite extreme on the intrusiveness scale and not even accurate, says Woodward.The role of ethics in AITo learn from these mistakes in developing the AI future, Woodward set to set AI ethics principles and document the algorithms – this is part of transparency as well as protecting your organisation.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/468868.jpg" alt="The ethics of AI: Tool, partner or master?" width="120" height="120">The ethics of AI: Tool, partner or master?Mention the words 'Artificial Intelligence' around your family dinner table and talk inevitably turns to a Terminator-like future...By Sorin Cheran 14 Nov 2018You’ll need to keep customer data secure and safe and respect their privacy, so the stakes are really high. With analytics, if only collect the data you know what to do with, potentially miss out.Often, AI mistakes arise from ignorance rather than intention, so ensure you’re putting as much diverse human intelligence into the thinking process as possible.Woodward also said to avoid groupthink and ensure there’s diversity in your existing team so that you don’t potentially miss something offensive down the line. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/501512-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty Images." width="120" height="120">Fostering diversity of thoughtDo you know what I love most about South Africa other than our resilience?

In conclusion, Woodward said that principles lead but rules follow in AI. We need to focus on augmenting humans rather than replacing them and raise awareness of deficiencies and biases in the system.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517241-120x120.jpg?4" alt="Griffin presenting at the Gartner Symposium." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Test your unconscious bias for a more diverse and inclusive work culture, today!Diversity and inclusion have become priorities for workplace performance and culture, but aspects of diversity are changing and unconscious biases often thwart efforts to provide more inclusivity...By Leigh Andrews 23 Sep 2019Watch the #GartnerSYM hashtag for further coverage of the Gartner Symposium.
