Under the theme, US-Africa Opportunity for Business & Trade Development, the event will bring together over 1400 attendees including 100+ CEO, Entrepreneurs, Top Government Leaders, Senior Executives and Diplomatic leaders.The partnership is sparked to build on the two entities' commitment to creating and sustaining a favourable business environment in Africa as well as helping African businesses expand into international markets. Given that Africa's diplomats, business and political leaders continue to pursue partnerships with the United States, the USAfrica Business Expo positions New York City and the State of New York as favourable destinations for Africa's business and political leaders looking to create new trade partnerships.Commenting on the partnership, USAfrica Business Expo CEO, Gbenga Omotayo noted that the partnership with AMA is a solid step into the journey of building an effective platform to help increase the exports of African countries. "African Media Agency (AMA) has clearly demonstrated its immense knowledge of the African landscape and passion for communicating a positive African narrative. We're excited to partner with AMA as we focus our combined energies serving African businesses and AMA is the perfect partner to help us fully realise our objectives".Said Elo√Øne Barry, CEO of African Media Agency (AMA), "The organisers of the event have been putting considerable emphasis on presenting business opportunities in the United States to African businesses. This collaboration will not only enable us to shed light on business opportunities, but also further enable our clients to win even more deals and grow their business."
