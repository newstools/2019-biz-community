She also elaborates on why she thinks the rise of full-service in-house agencies is particularly significant both locally and abroad..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Congrats with all the recent wins for Showmax. How do you feel about it?Thank you! We’re mostly proud that the work had significant business impact, entertained people and created a lot of talk. Being inside the business means we’re even more invested in the impact of campaigns, which makes it all the more rewarding. Wins like these also help us attract and retain talent, which is imperative for an internal agency. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What excites you most about the agency and where it’s going?The CMO Nicola Van Ast and head of connected video marketing Anna Vaulina started this agency in March 2017, and a significant amount of effort has gone into making it work. We’re now at the point where our many iterations of process and efforts to build collaborative cross-functional relationships are really starting to pay off. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/445422-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Vaulina, seen Showmaxing with Sbusi Dlamini, HR business partner: Connected video group at Multichoice." width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with...

So quite a lot….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about your career in advertising/entertainment?It’s so varied. From working on campaigns for critically-acclaimed HBO productions to reading original screenplays and coming up with ideas to market local shows, to collaborating with the product team on UX optimisation, every day is interesting. We’re also paying constant attention to what customers are saying, and testing and iterating, which is really rewarding. I’m fortunate to have worked at some great agencies prior to this role, Ogilvy being one of them – I learned from some really strong talents there – and had a freelance run that allowed me to work on a myriad of brands, so the variety and the fun, stand out most. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any career highlights you’re particularly proud of?The campaigns for the Showmax Originals Tali’s Wedding Diary and The Girl from St Agnes stand out, as we were a small team and worked incredibly hard on every element. For so many people to share and be entertained by the content was really rewarding. It feels good to win in the Integrated category in particular. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/471973.jpg" alt="Filming wraps on Showmax's first original drama" width="120" height="120">Filming wraps on Showmax's first original dramaThe Girl From St Agnes, Showmax's first original drama, wrapped this week after filming in the KwaZulu-Natal Midlands and Johannesburg. The eight-part whodunnit premieres on Showmax on 31 January 2019...Issued by Showmax 30 Nov 2018Two early-career highlights were in the film industry. I worked as the assistant to director Tom Hooper (The King’s Speech, Les Misérables) on a feature film, and got to observe a director’s role, the long-form process, and the craft of acting talents like Chiwetel Ejiofor and Hilary Swank. I also worked on a hilarious mockumentary called Confetti in London, set-managing Olivia Colman, Martin Freeman and Jimmy Carr at the start of their wonderful careers, and observing processes on an international film set. Those were a brilliant foundation for a career in advertising and entertainment. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the rise of in-house agencies locally and globally.While the rise of full-service in-house agencies is significant – more so globally than locally – I don’t believe that the external agency is heading for redundancy. I believe the choice to start a full-service internal agency should be informed entirely by the nature of the business, its objectives and its capacity to run an agency (which sounds obvious, but really requires rigorous analysis). <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1705/391906-120x120.jpg?2" alt="(c) Dmitriy Shironosov -" width="120" height="120">The rise of the in-house creative agencyTwo things strike me as the word ‘advertising' is increasingly replaced with phrases such as ‘branded content', ‘native' and ‘content marketing'...By James Hunt 12 May 2017How much does the business rely on cross-functional collaboration and quick content turnaround? Does the volume of work justify having permanent creative (not just design) and performance marketing teams? How significant are customer analytics and data in the marketing outputs? If the quality of creative thinking and the need to keep up with trends in advertising are important, does the business have a culture and rewards that will attract and retain strong creative talent? And so on. Nicola and Anna founded the agency with a clear vision. They handpicked the team members: in our case two creative leads (myself and art director Natalie Theron), a business unit director (Lauren McInnes) and a strategist (Thandeka Mali), and held a paid pitch process against other four-member teams. So, they didn’t just shove a bunch of strangers together and hope for the best. It’s a detailed topic and the above touches on just a few aspects of it, but I think an internal agency is more cost-effective and justifiable for a business of our nature than it might be for others..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to/enjoying so far?Our briefs are often along the lines of: ‘Inspire people to binge-watch this ground-breaking international show’ or ‘Read this original screenplay and come up with an online campaign’, so the enjoyment factor inherent in the briefs is pretty high. I also love guiding and learning from our growing creative team, fine-tuning processes, and discovering so much about the product and other business functions. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s at the top of your to-do list (at work)?Honestly?

I thought I was going to be cutting carrots but landed up in the gourmet kitchen. It was a (very) brief gig, with valuable learning: Don’t try and fake it till you make it.
