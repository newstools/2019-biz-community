In a world full of noise, cinema has proven incredibly effective for us at cutting through to not only establish our brand but also to convert cinema-goers into active supporters and donors.” “The cinema medium makes the most of its space, creative and audience to deliver gripping content, showing consumers advertising at its very best,” said Motheo Matsau, deputy CEO of Ster-Kinekor Theatres. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/512908-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Erik Witsoe on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Global cinema advertising is second-fastest growing ad medium of 2019Early forecasts by marketing intelligence service Warc places global cinema advertising behind the internet as the second-largest growing ad medium in 2019...22 Aug 2019“In 2020, the cinema medium is predicted to become the fastest-growing ad medium ahead of the internet. For brands like the World Food Programme who want to reach the hearts and minds of millennials, the immersive experience that Cinema gives is the most powerful of all storytelling mediums.”Poignant narrativeThe creative force behind the new advertisement is Sir John Hegarty, of The Garage SOHO, who has delivered a product designed to appeal directly to cinema audiences. The advert highlights the potential loss to the world when children’s voices are silenced due to hunger. The poignant narrative of the ad sees a group of Syrian refugee children who were selected from the local community playing in rubble and gazing out of bombed-out buildings in an apparent war zone. Softly, a small chorus of voices begins singing “How Can I Tell You” by Yusuf Islam/Cat Stevens. As the short film progresses, one by one these children disappear until only one voice remains – an unnerving conclusion that mirrors the harsh realities faced by the three million children around the world who lose their lives to hunger or malnutrition. "Cinema is still the most amazing medium for any creative person to work in. A place for you to tell your story on the ‘mother of all screens’. It’s not surprising that it’s so important and continues to capture the public’s imagination,” said Sir John Hegarty.
