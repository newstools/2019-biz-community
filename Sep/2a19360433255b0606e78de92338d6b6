The singing had to reflect the classic nature of the music. The song reflected and amplified the theme of forgiveness captured in the film, rendered via the versatile vocal stylings of Mariechan. Legendary guitarist, Mauritz Lotz, gave the recording even greater authenticity and a light, bright feel.
