<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516772.jpg" alt="FCB Joburg creates new TVC for Easy Waves" width="625" height="625">The 69-year-old brand, owned by Amka, targets women between the ages of 18–35 years who are happy to use products to soften, stretch and blow out their hair. At the same time, they are keen to embrace the trend towards keeping their hair in its natural form or with protective styles. Amka Brand Manager Shaylene Ramlakan explained: “The current trend is for black women to keep their hair in its natural form or wear weaves. However, going ‘au naturel’ is not for everyone and there are women who want to have natural-looking hair but find their own textures difficult to maintain. “Catering for semi-natural hair – or ‘blow-out’ hair, hair that is between processed hair and natural hair – Easy Waves Moroccan Oil is for women who do not want fully processed hair. This is a natural progression for Easy Waves, it gives women semi-processed hair while still allowing them to embrace their natural hair texture,” she said. FCB Joburg’s team of Creative Directors Nobantu Sibeko and Khanyi Mpumlwana, Art Director Naledi Manama and Copywriter Shannon Koor wanted to show how the Moroccan Oil range gives you bouncy, loose curls that you can style every day. To demonstrate this, they tell the story of a young woman who becomes suspicious when she starts seeing her friend’s boyfriend with ‘different women’. As a private eye would, she begins trailing him and building her case. When she has enough photographs, she confronts ‘the other woman’ but – to her surprise – it’s been her friend all along. Thanks to the Easy Waves Moroccan Oil range, she’s been able to restyle her hair and unwittingly dupe her friend. Shot by Director Kit of Hey Darling Films over one day in Parktown, the 30-second TVC will flight on e.tv, SABC, Home channel, MTV Base (Via-Com), DStv, ENCA and VIA Channel from September this year. It will run for 12 months in this format, supported by a 10-second cut-down and print campaign.
