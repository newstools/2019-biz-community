I mostly enjoy working with the team to get to grips with the real business issues that our clients are facing – and encouraging them to have real conversations about how what we do can truly impact business results. So, for me, it’s the combination of growing people and doing challenging work..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any career highlights you’re particularly proud of? I think it’s like looking at pieces of a puzzle that holistically create a great picture. I thoroughly enjoyed my time on the client-side – particularly in the digital and CRM work that I did at BMW, and then in the blank-page opportunity that I had to relaunch the Lexus brand to the South African market. Then, on the agency-side, the challenge of running an integrated strategic marketing team including analytics, media and social media at Aqua (now Wunderman), as well as building and launching a training academy focused on teaching our teams to engage with clients as partners as opposed to service providers, and, then, coaching entrepreneurial clients to make the most of their businesses are all real highlights. I’m also really proud and passionate about the global leadership development work that I do..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us a bit about your experience and how this has equipped you for your new position. I think the fact that I have experience with the client- and agency-side as well as business coaching and leadership development space, globally..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to/enjoying so far? I am really enjoying the uniqueness of B2B marketing vs B2C marketing. The opportunity to go deep into understanding the decision-making units and purchase journey that is so different in the B2B space is exciting. This, together with the opportunity to effectively use marketing technology to drive efficiencies and extremely targeted and relevant communication, is amazing. B2B needs to be a lot more strategic in many ways, than B2C, and I love that.

I read a lot and broadly. What I am re-reading now is: It starts with Why by Simon Sinek.         View this post on Instagram           Ending off this #BookClubWeek is Prianca’s choice with Start With Why by Simon Sinek. Pri loves this book as it dives deep into why some people and organisations are more inventive, pioneering and successful than others and why they are able to repeat their success time and time again. The book talks about the types of questions we should be asking to unlock the secret to inspirational business. #bookclubweek #smarthabits A post shared by  Demographica (@demographica) on Aug 30, 2018 at 12:53am PDT .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us something about yourself not generally known?I studied journalism way back when and, I think that the same characteristic of being curious about people is what I still dial back to in every aspect of my life today.For news and updates visit the Demographica website and follow the company on the following social media platforms: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
