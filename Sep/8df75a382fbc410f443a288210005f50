I cannot wait to grow it into some of the agencies I find inspiring.4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. My kids, literature, movies, Champagne, cooking and spending time with my friends talking trash.5. What do you love about your industry? I love having the opportunity to contribute positively to a client’s business.What I love even more is making their dreams come true and then seeing the appreciation in their faces. I love that the value that we add is something that is actually tangible.6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. Because I am the CEO of the agency, I hardly ever spend time at the office. My average workday involves meeting up with the various clients to do the all-important one-on-one face time, being in client briefing sessions or doing business development – which involves a lot of writing of proposals.

What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? Millions of my kids’ selfies. There’s nothing I can do to stop them using my phone to take selfies of themselves.16. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry? Focus on corporate communications instead of lifestyle and celebrity PR. Corporate comms is where you can find sustainability. Celebrities don’t have budget, and they have big followership numbers, which means they can do most of their own PR and communications.Simple as that.
