East Coast Radio’s General Manager, Boni Mchunu spoke of the day as a new beginning for creative geniuses. “Today is a celebration. It has been 16 years since the station last did an upgrade like this so it was imperative for us to appoint a team that is capable and aware of the global trends so that we can make cutting-edge technological advances in the radio industry. I am confident in the future of the station and I look forward to the magic that the ECR on-air team will create there,” said Mchunu. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515078-625x417.jpg" alt="East Coast Radio goes futuristic with the launch of new on-air studios" width="625" height="417">The new studios that offer the perfect viewing for the East Coast sunrises and sunsets, consists of 70 metres of LED lighting, “floating floors” to prevent vibrations, 5400 metres of network cables and state of the art technology to keep the station ahead of the pack. East Coast Breakfast host, Darren Maule shared why this new studio installation was so important for the station. “I have been in radio for almost 10 years now and throughout my career of visiting stations and working from other booths, this is by far the most technologically advanced studio out there. We, as talent are only as good as our words would take us, but what good would that be if the microphone was switched off? Or if you heard a buzzing sound the whole time? So, an upgrade in technology and studio’s means an upgrade in the quality of radio and an amplification of content that others can now look forward to,” said Maule. As East Coast Radio cuts cotton to a new studio on 2 September 2019, listeners can cheers an even better quality of radio offering from KZN’s No.1.
