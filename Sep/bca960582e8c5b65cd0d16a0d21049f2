But the stage was ignited by the stellar show by none other than our very own award-winning international success, Belinda Davids. Her tribute to the late, Whitney Houston had everyone on their feetThe event was held at a new venue to accommodate the growing number of attendees, as it filled no less than three exhibition halls at the Century City Conference Centre. This year’s theme, “Red Carpet”, ensured that this really was a glamourous affair.  Guests were spoilt from the minute they walked in, to the time they left. Engen with pamper stations, amazing prizes, a mouth-watering menu and of course, getting to rub shoulders with their favourite presenters at Heart FM.  Aden Thomas, Julian Naidoo, Tapfuma Makina, Clarence Ford, Jeremy Harris and Deon Bing all looked suave as they presented some amazing awards to the guests. But of course, our ladies stole the show with their glitz and glamour. Our on-air talent boasts a strong female contingent. Not only are they gorgeous, but have pioneered the way forward for females in a predominantly male dominated industry. Drive 326 host, SUGA was one of the first female presenters in South African broadcast history, to host her own Drive show back in the early 2000’s. While Brunch host, Irma G was one of the first female DJ’s to host R&B and Hip-Hop nights in local clubs, and one of the most versatile on-air personalities today. Jo-Dee Butler has come into her own, as she now hosts her own Saturday morning show after only a few years on air under the guidance of her female mentors.Managing Director, Renee Redelinghuys comments, “We are proud to say that our female listeners are representative of a powerful demographic. 45% are working women, with an above average income. She is independent, modern, yet traditional in her values. She is financially savvy and naturally, a go-getter! Women at Heart is not only an opportunity to celebrate Women’s month, but a signature event where our female audience is able to immerse themselves in a day of opulence and fun and truly put themselves first. It’s an event for women from diverse backgrounds to come together in support of each other. Sisters, mothers, daughters, businesswomen, entrepreneurs, politicians, home executives, all under one roof, celebrating a sisterhood.”To view the images from the event, go to http://heartfm.co.za/galleries/women-at-heart-showbiz-edition-2019/
