Both are studying towards a National Certificate in Film and Television Production.“Nwabisa – aka Palesa – interned as a copywriter with HelloFCB+. She describes herself as a poet and a future published author, and is passionate about litchi juice and the idea of living with purpose!” added Campbell. “Mpho, who interned with Fuelcontent’s creative team as a multimedia designer, is a self-taught photographer, videographer and editor who is influenced by nonconformist artists like of Jean Michel Basquiat as well as the zeitgeist of the late 1960s through to the late 1990s. We’ve really enjoyed their contribution to the work we do for our clients.”
