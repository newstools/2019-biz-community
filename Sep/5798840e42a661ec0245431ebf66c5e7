This has proven effective in Gartner's CIO Research group, which creates actionable and applicable research, focused on leadership and learning development by exploring concepts related to team development, management and leadership skills development and self and team motivation. Doing so provides an exponential business advantage over your competitors in attracting top talent, improving the customer experience you offer as you have more diversity behind the scenes, which also leads to better opportunities for innovation, so why isnâ€™t everybody doing it?D&I guidelines for 2020 and beyondGriffin said the answer is simple: While some are constantly looking to improve and move forward in this direction, unfortunately, many are stuck at the talking phase, without moving on to action.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/514226-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: Understand true diversity to become more inclusively creative" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Understand true diversity to become more inclusively creativeOne of the most interesting sessions of the DStv Seminar of Creativity at #Loeries2019 creative week touched on the difference between inherent and acquired diversity. But many gloss over these terms as business jargon and don't even know which is which, and why both are valuable to your creativity...By Leigh Andrews 2 Sep 2019Explaining what diversity and inclusion or D&I means as we approach 2020, Griffin said a core change is that there's no longer just focus on the physical appearance.Instead, diversity now includes different backgrounds and experiences, as well as different values and preferences. Inclusion, on the other hand, is about creating a safe environment in which to be treated fairly, respectfully and contribute equally.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495075-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Tips to enhance belongingness in your workplaceThere's been renewed emphasis on issues of inclusion and diversity in the corporate and advertising world lately, but that often leads to a sense of being the 'first, only or different' - at least in the early stages. That's a lonely place to be. Here's how to enhance a sense of belonging in your workplace...By Leigh Andrews 6 May 2019We have to ask whether it's truly safe to fail in our organisations. Up the age and digital diversityIf there are extreme consequences for this, there's likely to be less willingness to innovate and less inclusion than you'd like. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516954.jpg" alt="Perennials: The secret weapon every company needs" width="120" height="120">Perennials: The secret weapon every company needsPerennials: an evergreen generation who remain curious and relevant despite their advancing age.

Now, with a rise of 'diversity and inclusion' focused roles popping in advertising, here's why it's important to focus on a range of ages and experience levels for true business transformation...By Leigh Andrews 15 Apr 2019That links to Griffin's next point - that digital diversity is growing in importance, as we realise that digital dexterity - defined as aptitude and attitude to technology and all things digital, will vary across teams.Why you should take an unconscious bias testGriffin commented that while there's a push towards being more intentional about including diversity across industries, when it comes to inclusion this can be difficult, as layers of unconscious bias can hide certain views and values that run beneath the surface in the company. If you don't fit in, you stand out.Not that that's always a bad thing. It's all in how you handle it, and how others interact with you.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/473073-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: How to handle being 'the only' in the boardroom" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: How to handle being 'the only' in the boardroomFrom queen bee syndrome to unchecked micro-aggressions and struggling to deal with being 'the only' in the boardroom, Corinium's Women in Digital and Data Forum touched on many topics that may be subconsciously holding back our businesses from becoming more inclusive...By Leigh Andrews 10 Dec 2018That said, Griffin mentioned that we all have blind spots and experiences that colour the way we view the world. She recommends taking a free unconscious bias test online.Unless you're highly trained in the subject and have dealt with the issues that arise, if you are human, you're biasedGriffin said this is part of survival, as we take in 11 million pieces of information per second, but are consciously aware of just 40 of those as we filter out the rest.Back to basics to minimise bias in the hiring process<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516260-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Marketing the future: Unlocking the human element in a digital world" width="120" height="120">Marketing the future: Unlocking the human element in a digital worldA data science expert, mind science practitioner and advertising strategist walk into a bar...

Do you include 'nice to have' personality attributes over what is actually needed to get the job done, as that's what you're hiring for?Ensure there's diversity sitting in on the interview process.Do your research to make sure the final offer is equitable, based on the current market rate.Relook at your current succession planning policies and how you identify high-potentials internally. Is there equal opportunity to rise to the next level for all? If not, what can you do to improve accessibility?Griffin also said you can identify a good leader internally when others keep asking to join their team - that's usually a sign of inclusivity. Support through mentors and sponsorsWhen it comes to succession planning, Griffin recommends assigning mentors to help employees develop in their current role, and sponsors to help them reach their future aspirations.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1807/447668-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Think Creative Hub's cofounders and creative directors Nkgabiseng 'Nkgabi' Motau and Mukondi Ralushayi." width="120" height="120">#Mandela100: The Madiba magic of mentoringThink Creative Hub's cofounders and creative directors Nkgabiseng 'Nkgabi' Motau and Mukondi Ralushayi explain the importance of being both a mentor and mentee...By Leigh Andrews 5 Jul 2018Also keep in mind that the words we use matter, and train your leadership team to recognise and confront behaviours that marginalise team members.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517249.jpg" alt="Griffin presenting some pointers on making language more inclusive." width="625" height="388" rel="">Griffin presenting some pointers on making language more inclusive.click to enlargeWatch the #GartnerSYM hashtag for further coverage of the Gartner Symposium.
