There is an urgent need for a deep transformation of how we live and how we do business," Jackie May, founder and editor of Twyg, said in her address during the awards ceremony.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506204-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Twyg Awards to spotlight conscious Southern African fashion brands" width="120" height="120">Twyg Awards to spotlight conscious Southern African fashion brandsNominations are open for the inaugural Twyg Sustainable Fashion Awards, which recognise Southern African designers who have implemented a sustainable design approach...10 Jul 2019Facilitating industry transformationTwyg is working with organisations like World Wide Fund for Nature, Fashion Revolution, The Southern African Clothing and Textile Workers’ Union, The African Fashion Research Institute and SA Fashion Week to further its work of facilitating the transformation of the industry. SACTWU says the South African clothing and textile industry’s future growth path has to be based on sustainability, both in terms of our environmental impact and how workers are paid and treated. Twyg’s mission is to gather resources, disseminate research and make this accessible to designers, while its storytelling platform guides consumers in responsible lifestyle choices.A model in a striking dress designed by Mzukise Mbane of Imprint ZA circled the floor at the awards ceremony.

I was really happy to see this collection as it is proof that you can design something ‘new’ from re-used items. It takes a conscious designer to see this opportunity,” said Cyril Naicker.Nicholas Coutts Award: Clive RundleThis award recognises a designer who uses artisanal craft techniques such as weaving, embroidering or botanical dying to make fashion that foregrounds, celebrates and values the skills of the person who makes the garment.“Clive Rundle remains unbeaten when it comes to experimenting with fabric manipulating techniques!

With her clean handwriting and choice of fabrication, her garments are able to travel from season to season making them exceptionally timeless. That’s her winning formula,” said Fezile Mdletshe-Mkhize.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513577-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#G7Biarritz: Fashion industry giants sign global sustainability pact" width="120" height="120">#G7Biarritz: Fashion industry giants sign global sustainability pactThirty-two global fashion and textile companies, including Adidas, Chanel and H&M, have signed a Fashion Pact, committing to achieving practical objectives together in three areas: climate, biodiversity and oceans...27 Aug 2019Sponsored by PETCOPET plastic recycling company, PETCO, the was the headline sponsor of the Twyg Awards.PETCO’s Janine Osborne said, “PETCO is proud to be the sponsor for the inaugural Sustainable Fashion Awards.
