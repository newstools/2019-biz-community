The other Sanlam title, Impact, was also runner-up in this category. FNB Sync took Best Digital Publication and AB InBev took Best Communication Innovation. Trudie Myburgh was honoured as a runner-up in the Editor of the Year category for her editorship of the Sanlam titles. This is the second year that Trudie has been acknowledged in this category. Last year FNB Sync, an enterprise social network app for FNB employees, was recognised as a leading innovation in the internal communications space with the Best Communication Innovation award. The fact that this year it was recognised as the Best Digital Publication shows the consistency with which New Media is proving excellence in the industry. “Industry awards are always a strong affirmation,” says Andrew Nunneley, New Media’s Director of Brand Strategy. “I believe our internal comms division is one of the best in South Africa because while we constantly have our eye on global trends, we do this with a solid footing in local industry research. Our internal comms team understands what works within our South African market and they work hard to apply it using global best practise.” This is a winning formula as the year-on-year accolades from the SAPF Awards show.
