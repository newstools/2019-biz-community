In short, he’s a natural fit. “I’m very honoured to be a part of the Husqvarna group,” says Tendai. “It’s a world-class brand, and it’s incredible to be working with such a professional team.” (A big compliment when you consider the star athlete’s other teammates.) <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517865.jpg" alt="Husqvarna proudly announces Tendai 'Beast' Matawarira as its first-ever African ambassador" width="625" height="205">Products that make a difference Welcoming Tendai into the Husqvarna family meant ensuring he’s got all the products he needs to help him take the very best care of his garden. Just one that’s making a world of difference to Matawarira home is the brand’s best-selling automower®. “I’m often on the road or on the field so, when I was home, much of my free time was spent doing chores around the house. Now, because all the mowing is done for me, I am able to enjoy more time with my family.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517866.jpg" alt="Husqvarna proudly announces Tendai 'Beast' Matawarira as its first-ever African ambassador" width="625" height="206">The automower® is one of Husqvarna’s many battery-driven “Silent Nature™” products. As it’s powered by electricity, it doesn’t produce harmful emissions and works hard in virtual silence. As you can imagine, Tendai’s neighbours are big fans too. “No more noisy mowing on Sundays,” he laughs. In fact, he now never has to spend any of his days cutting grass. “When I spend time overseas I now don’t have to worry about coming home to an overgrown garden. These products are really making a difference!” Another Husqvarna item making life easier for the Matawarira’s is the brand’s high-pressure washer. It’s so much fun to use that Tendai’s kids are actually looking forward to helping their dad wash the family’s cars. “Everyone was also really excited about the generator,” says Tendai. “Now we’ll never miss another game on TV when there are power cuts!” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517867.jpg" alt="Mark Odell from Husqvarna South Africa’s technical team with Sarah Swanson (Husqvarna South Africa marketing co-ordinator), Tendai “Beast” Matawarira and Jenna Robinson (Husqvarna Africa’s regional marketing manager)." width="414" height="276">Mark Odell from Husqvarna South Africa’s technical team with Sarah Swanson (Husqvarna South Africa marketing co-ordinator), Tendai “Beast” Matawarira and Jenna Robinson (Husqvarna Africa’s regional marketing manager).<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517868.jpg" alt="Instore point of sale for the campaign." width="199" height="276">Instore point of sale for the campaign.Eyes on the future According to Husqvarna Africa’s regional marketing manager, Jenna Robinson, the brand is widely recognised throughout the continent. “We have a presence in 30 countries in Africa and are the leading professional brand within our market,” she says. However, the company is looking forward to emboldening its already strong position by partnering with Tendai, a personality whose appeal goes beyond borders. As it stands, the product range for Africa includes over 280 items, and the catalogue is ever expanding as it innovates. Still, Husqvarna wants to move in a way that’s strategic as well as sustainable. “By 2025, 60 percent of the global population will be living in cities; fewer will have gardens and shared urban green spaces will become more relevant. We need to think ahead, plan for the future and worry more about emissions - hence our extensive range of battery products and ‘silent nature’* drive,” says Robinson. “Less noise, less disruption, less harm to the environment - we believe in that, and it helps us stand out.” To watch the new campaign with Tendai – visit https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFPFCTqrs5BACrB9LmCsT4A/videos.To learn more about the brand and find your nearest Husqvarna dealer, visit www.husqvarna.co.za.
