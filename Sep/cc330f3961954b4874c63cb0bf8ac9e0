The competition launches 7 October and will run until end November. Known for their life-changing on-air and off-air initiatives, the local broadcaster’s latest competition is taking things to a whole new level. “We know how tough it can be in our current economy to save for that dream home or put money aside for your child’s education. We wanted to offer an opportunity that can literally change someone’s life, by giving them a chance to win a really large sum of money,” says Programme Manager, Naveen Singh. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/518692.jpg" alt="Local radio station launches R2m giveaway" width="510" height="340">Breakfast show co-host, Lindy Lehto, highlights the need for positive news and the station’s mandate to keep South Africans in good spirits. “As a media broadcaster we have so much power to influence mood, and that’s what we are all about. We are so excited to be the first to offer the biggest cash prize ever in South African radio. That’s two million reasons to smile.” The competition is open to all South Africans over 18 years old and will involve a music-driven mechanism with a surprise finale.
