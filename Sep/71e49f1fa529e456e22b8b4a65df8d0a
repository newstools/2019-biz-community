We understand the community we have been in for so long and then we bring South African traditional flavours that people love to eat,” says Lauren Burmeister, marketing manager - Koo at Tiger Brands The consumer is key to the brand, says Toni Maake, brand manager, Koo. “They are who we are and because of them, we are Koo. We don’t tell them about the brand, they tell us. They tell us their stories, about their lives and how they enjoy the brand. It’s about how we relive their stories, and how they see Koo in their everyday lives.” She adds: Our stories revolve around how the brand has enriched our consumers lives all these years, whether it is nourishing Sunday meals or a convenience meal.Koo is proudly South Africa and a household brand. “People have grown up with Koo and when they move to a different town or city, they take Koo and their memories of their mom cooking a family meal with them. So, the brand transcends from one generation to the next. It’s the feeling of Koo, that warm hug and love, that the generations embrace,” said Burmeister. Koo has been a heritage brand for years and next year it turns 80. “Koo is all about dishing up more love and that’s the brand purpose we are driving in terms of where we are going in the future,” she adds.Green and socialThe Top Brands awards are special because they make us realise that we are doing our job right with our brand still top of mind with consumers, says Lerato Dlamini, Coke brand manager for Southern and East Africa, The Coca-Cola Company.
