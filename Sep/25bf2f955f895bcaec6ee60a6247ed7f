I was part of the jury, led by Heidi Brauer, for the Marketer of the Year sub-committee, so Viviers’s excellence in his role especially shines through when Brauer says,Viviers is completely deserving of the Marketer of the Year award, for marketing leadership consistency, and a track record of solid business results. He is an inspirational marketer who really understands that marketing is both science and art by harmonising gut and experience with data. His role within Capitec is both wide and deep, but it is his meticulous attention to detail and understanding of people that really sets him apart.But the entire panel proved its marketing worth in sharing insights into how marketing boosts brand value.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515772.jpg" alt="Panellists Bradshaw, Walsh and Viviers of Pick n Pay, Takealot and Capitec Bank respectively, with Kantar's Du Chenne." width="625" height="302">Panellists Bradshaw, Walsh and Viviers of Pick n Pay, Takealot and Capitec Bank respectively, with Kantar's Du Chenne.Walsh demonstrated, this is explaining, that for Takealot, trust is essential, so the aim of ‘making authentic communication’ serves as a guiding light. To dial that up, she shared that humour is definitely coming in strong.The human face of an increasingly automated processThe e-commerce brand is also running a shopper campaign at the moment, which shows it’s not all automated – there’s a human face to Takealot, and that they deliver on their promise of ‘shop anything you can imagine’, while making quick decisions to simplify, innovate and individualise the offering, all while having fun as the team has a passion for what they do.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1710/415859.png" alt="M&amp;C Saatchi Abel and Takealot.com change South Africans' perceptions around online shopping" width="120" height="120">M&C Saatchi Abel and Takealot.com change South Africans' perceptions around online shoppingEvery family has their go-to guy; the person whose name gets called every time mom or dad needs something, big or small...Issued by M&C Saatchi Abel 24 Oct 2017Bradshaw commented that he personally loves the way Takealot captures those human truths, adding that TV ads are just a small part of what marketers do, so scaling that overall experience relies on a clear understanding of how best to gain insights from the ‘13m customer experience moments’ and what your customers really want.Linked to this, Viviers said Capitec was surprised but pleased to have won on the aspect of purpose as it’s something the bank has been working on behind the scenes.Purpose is especially important as brands and corporates alike need to serve their customers and communities by making a difference.Points on purpose and emotional connectionCapitec does this by focusing on issues of financial literacy and financial inclusion in particular. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495980.png" alt="Africa's big 5 keys to financial transformation, inclusion" width="120" height="120">Africa's big 5 keys to financial transformation, inclusionWith mobile money continuing to dominate the continent's commerce growth, opening doors to business to everyone from a rural farmer to an entrepreneur, and cross-border seeing inter-country transactions on the rise, the continent is making a play to be the world's biggest e-commerce opportunity...9 May 2019Ivan Moroke – CEO of Kantar’s Insights Division, South Africa – mentioned the importance of emotional cultural connection in this regard.

It’s not something to only consider if you have leftover budget to 'wokewash’ your brand. Instead, the brands that push through the clutter are those that consistently prove that ‘doing good’ is good business.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1708/404735-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Alaister Russell via Times Live" width="120" height="120">Loyalty cards surge as hard times bitePeople are going mad for loyalty programmes whose cash-back and discount benefits are helping reduce the sting of hard times...By Wendy Knowler 2 Aug 2017It’s most important for all brands to keep this in mind, as they strive to help customers solve their problems better than any other brand.Making sense of middle-market movesSalama commented that he’s noticed South African brands resonate when they rely on heritage in terms of salience and awareness, not just as a differentiating factor but rather as a way to further offer value through a sense of belonging.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/510053-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Kantar CEO, Eric Salama.

It’s an especially tough place to be in the UK – with discounters at the bottom building value, as well as the likes of Waitrose on top. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1612/373483-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Learning lessons from online shopping in 2016" width="120" height="120">Learning lessons from online shopping in 2016While the estimated R8.9bn spent annually online in South Africa may not be on a par with the UK or USA, things are changing as demographics and perceptions shift...22 Dec 2016But it’s a similar situation elsewhere, such as in France, China and the USA. But the middle is a tough place to be when some segments are willing to pay premium prices and others skip the physical store entirely to shop online. So how do you occupy middle without being boring or bland?Bradshaw said the middle is a great place to be if your brand can deliver value. Pick n Pay does this with a focus on convenience, time-saving and in offering healthier options as ways to help their customers solve their problems.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513469-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The double-edged demand of the South African consumer" width="120" height="120">The double-edged demand of the South African consumerThe consumer landscape is currently fragmented and polarised, characterised by the double-edged demand of the South African consumer. Some are feeling prosperous, while others are amongst the most stretched spenders...26 Aug 2019Viviers actually started his career at Shoprite and pointed out that the lower end of the income scale isn’t satisfied with a lower level of quality, either. You can’t afford to give any customer a bad experience, as the expectation of ‘value for money’ has grown from simply meaning the cheapest price. Customers want the same experience, whether they visit your shop in Sandton or Alexandra. That’s why it’s dangerous to target customers purely on the basis of their income. Consumers of today are willing to spend money in the categories that are important to them, and luxury brands have increased in value as the middle-class becomes more aspirational. It’s category dependent as well as need-state dependent.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496041-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Luxury beauty now available on Takealot and Superbalist" width="120" height="120">Luxury beauty now available on Takealot and SuperbalistSouth Africans can now shop for their favourite luxury beauty brands online at Takealot.com and Superbalist.com...10 May 2019Bradshaw and Salama shared that this means while you can expect more perks, you shouldn’t necessarily be treated better as a first-class passenger than if you’re seated in economy.Viviers added that technology has become a reality in everyday life for shoppers, who see no reason for the same design and capability to not follow through at every store. For Capitec, technology helps simplify the experience at front-end for the customer, while also centralising the experience – and driving processes at the back. But there’s still a strong need for a human element.Still on the topic of technology, Walsh said tech definitely enables much of the Takealot ‘mall in your pocket’ offering – and feels the fact that consumers can now compare products and prices anywhere through their mobile phones has resulted in retailers becoming more honest. Best of both worlds: Clicks and mortarPain points still include delivering to difficult-to-find areas and accommodating those without credit cards, but it has added an EFT or cash-on-delivery payment option.Takealot has also opened up ‘click and collect’ pick-up points, where consumers can collect the goods they’ve ordered at a time that works for them – this despite not having a defined bricks-and-mortar presence.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/498171-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Takealot's Pick-up Points a milestone for SA e-commerce" width="120" height="120">Takealot's Pick-up Points a milestone for SA e-commercePargo CEO and co-founder Lars Veul shares why he thinks Takealot Pick-up Points make so much sense...By Lars Veul 24 May 2019Speaking of another top talking point: The Pick n Pay Smart Shopper customer loyalty database, Bradshaw shared that it currently has 7.5 million active loyalty card-holders. The supermarket chain is also working with its partners to promote what customers buy most often and offer ‘Just for You’ personalised discounts on that rather than in trying to convert customers to other brands. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/463721-120x120.jpg?2" alt="New Smart Shopper benefits - points for petrol, cardless functionality and more" width="120" height="120">New Smart Shopper benefits - points for petrol, cardless functionality and morePick n Pay has announced a host of enhancements to its popular rewards programme, including a partnership with BP service stations that allows Smart Shopper members to earn points when refueling...16 Oct 2018This customer-first view has proven itself over any initial misgivings about ‘auto-rewarding’ customers through their purchase data.Obviously, Takealot also has stacks of purchase data – and Walsh confirmed that any decision is made based on the data, though they do aim to cut through the clutter and not just add dashboards for sake of having them.In-the-moment marketing, in actionShowing how this impacts on customers, Walsh said the zeitgeist of searches on Takealot guides the marketing.For example, last week saw a rise in searches for pepper spray and tazers. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515505-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Trending images relating to the #AmINext hashtag and the much-shared pic of the protest march outside Parliament on 5 September 2019: ." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Stepping up to keep SA's females safeLocal media - social media in particular - has covered the general sense of unrest and discomfort in the country this week, following the most recent spate of femicide cases that spurred the nation to say #Enoughisenough and ask #AmInext?

Again, this is that ‘tough nut’ middle market that needs social proof before taking anything new at face value, but Takealot is successfully busting friction factors that form common FAQs like ‘where do you deliver if am not home at the time’, ‘will I receive what I order in the correct size and colour’ and ‘will my credit card info be safe?’It’s about constantly living the promise, which builds that all-important social proof.<img src="https://biz-file.com/b/1805/427519.jpg?2" alt="Boris Dzhingarov" width="120" height="120">Five tips for reducing friction in the e-commerce sales processBuying online is almost second nature for many of today's consumers, but there are still some common friction points that make online shoppers feel uncomfortable...By Boris Dzhingarov, Issued by Monetary Library 7 Aug 2017Commending this year’s winners, Salama added that many marketers flounder as they already own a wealth of data, and few are actually looking for more data.Instead, they’re struggling with too many dashboards, as well as in sorting out what’s relevant and making the insights actionable in the company. That’s where Pick n Pay, Capitec and Takelot are really winning.Foster concluded the morning with further congratulations to the brands that featured this year, as statistically, “it’s more difficult to appear in BrandZ than it is to win an Oscar!”Click through to the Kantar press office and follow BrandZ on Twitter for the latest updates.
