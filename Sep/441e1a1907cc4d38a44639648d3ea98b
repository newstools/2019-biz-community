This era made Kylie Jenner a billionaire in three years.Revlon trialled influencer campaigns relatively recently. Late to the game means late to insights and optimisations.And Revlon’s size and complexity certainly don’t help it adapt quickly to what it’s hearing from fans and influencers the way DTC cult brand Glossier does when it pivots product and packaging based on community feedback. The influencer game changed, but Revlon did not change with it fast enough.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/512167-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Direct-to-consumer marketing enigma is not insurmountable" width="120" height="120">Direct-to-consumer marketing enigma is not insurmountableDirect-to-consumer (DTC) brands are threatening retailer market share with their unconventional business models and provocative brand ethos...By Anjali Lai 20 Aug 2019Change continues, making adaptability and agility keys to successEven as you read this, influencer marketing is changing again.

But its influencer strategy signals a failure to keep pace with consumers, to recognise new trends, to change existing processes. The lesson learned: While remaining unchanged works for Cindy Crawford, it does not for business — adaptability and agility do.
