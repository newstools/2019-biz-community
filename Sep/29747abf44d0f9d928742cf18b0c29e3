The list of available media is endless when the area you’re focusing on is metropolitan, with bigger populations that have easier access to brands.But what happens when the brief delves into the Lowveld areas such as Nelspruit, White River, Lydenburg, Baberton and Hazyview? That’s when media gets really interesting. How do you target an area with a small population that lives a very subtle lifestyle but still believes in the spirit of Ubuntu?<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1609/359049.jpg" alt="Afrillennials: who they are and how to hire them" width="120" height="120">Afrillennials: who they are and how to hire themMillennials are steadily overtaking older staff as South Africa's largest representative generation of workers, introducing an entirely new mindset that businesses will have to master...By Andy Coe 6 Sep 2016Recently, I was tasked to do a three-month campaign for one of my clients in the Nelspruit region. It was a pilot campaign to see if the product would generate interest in a small suburban area with a low budget.After the research, the team and I proposed utilising OOH platforms like street poles and Citilites, combined with digital. After three months, we sat down with the clients and looked at its performance. But to put it mildly, the campaign didn’t even take off the runway. However, the client (and us) believed in the product and decided to give it another try.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496841-120x120.png?1" alt="How to harness the power of your target market" width="120" height="120">How to harness the power of your target marketMarket research and data can be an invaluable tool when crafting a brand strategy, providing brands with the power to harness their target market. Today, marketers have a multitude of choice of available data; however, being given a plethora of statistics does not necessarily translate into the ability to create a winning brand strategy. There is an art to using data to develop a brand's personality and key messaging, and to finding the right channels through which to engage with consumer segments within a target market.Issued by Ask Afrika 8 Mar 2018We started looking more closely at the Nelspruit area and how the residents behaved in certain situations. We started noting the following key points, common in a lot of small towns:The spirit of UbuntuAs an ‘80s baby, we grew up with the saying: “It takes a village to raise a child.” This is still common in areas like the Lowveld and other small towns in and around South Africa. Everyone knows and respects one other and word of mouth goes a long way as a form of credibility and reference.Local eventsLocal events such as music concerts, school sports and community gatherings bring people together. Everyone shows up for each other and supports their own. If a brand wants to be part of these events, however, it needs to provide the community with value that also empowers the area.InfluencersWord gets around quickly in a small community. Using the right influential individual/s in these communities goes a long way in assisting a brand to reach the right people at the right time.Local media platformsPeople in small towns are loyal to their media platforms. They use these to guide them on what’s happening in and around their areas as these platforms are very involved in the communities they represent. A brand should always find a way to integrate themselves into these platforms so that they can be seen as part of the community.While there is always a place for traditional media when communicating to the “out-of-towners”, it’s important to realise that every local community has its own intricacies, loves, fears and the manner in which they operate on a daily basis. It’s using these local insights that make for a much better experience which in turn becomes an excellent communication strategy.Now we’re cooking!
