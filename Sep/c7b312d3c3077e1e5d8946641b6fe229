We didn't mean to make anyone angry. We hope you will try some of our new chicken and see why we think it’s worth getting flame-grilled for �� https://t.co/h9xcCuIaUQ— Pick n Pay (@PicknPay) September 9, 2019What is an “all-new summer range” of chicken anyway?@PicknPay It's not just Chicken, it's iNkukhu �� Our all-new summer range is perfect for the braai. Get your summer sorted here > http://bit.ly/2Uo8u5Q #PnpSummerSortedWhat’s really baffling is what an “all-new summer range” of chicken even is! Also the word range here - a tantalising nugget which everyone seems to have missed. Is it something to do with free ‘range’? Is there a new ‘range’ of flavours? Colour-coded packaging range? Have Pick n Pay introduced an iNkukhu-label fashion range? (By the way, love this idea, Pick n Pay - call me).  "It’s not just chicken, it’s CHICKEN!"Another mistake is that the communications are just too generic. Are they promoting N'ku'cooked chicken or Un'Nku'cooked chicken, ready for the bring and braai? The fact that anybody believed the line "It’s not just chicken, it’s CHICKEN!" was “a fun way to bring out the deliciousness of our new chicken”, sums up the whole half-baked fiasco. “Yuh, kwaze kwa'awks”Yuh, kwaze kwa'awks. https://t.co/Mw2HoHzKGr— NandosSA (@NandosSA) September 9, 2019With all the recent sad and bad news, South Africans have been experiencing as of late, we’re in need of laughs and you can rely on Nando’s for that. Sadly, their single tweet ‘Yuh, kwaze kwa'awks” and its 1K comments, 4,4k retweets and 9k likes to date, have been about the only thing hungry Saffers have thus far been able to feast upon.On a practical note, it’s a chilly September, an unlikely time to expect brand promises of an “all-new summer range” and hashtag #PnpSummerSorted to entice a dash for the poultry aisles.There is nothing intrinsically wrong with the term “iNkukhu”, it could even have been kinda cute. When so many aspects of a marketing strategy are ill-conceived it leaves you wide open to being torn apart which is what has happened. If the ads were strategically sounder, better thought through, better executed and had delivered on even one promise of “new” chicken, they might even have nailed it!<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/483268.png" alt="Of landmarks and brand marks" width="120" height="120">Of landmarks and brand marksTerry Levin asks if the same principles were applied to the renovation of heritage brand marks as heritage landmarks, what criteria could be used to evaluate them?By Terry Levin, Issued by Off the Shelf marketing 19 Feb 2019
