This is particularly true if you’re using social content to entice prospective employees by highlighting your company culture. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/460972.jpg" alt="Heritage Month is just a flash in the pan if brands are to win with the youth" width="120" height="120">Heritage Month is just a flash in the pan if brands are to win with the youthAs Heritage Month becomes a memory in the mind of consumers, one has to wonder if brands have properly used the occasion to cement their identity and position with the youth market.Issued by HDI Youth Consultancy 2 Oct 2018However, if you’re trying to incite discussion or engagement, this is the wrong way to go about it. Too often, these posts feel insincere or artificial and can do more bad to brand reputation than good.  Don’t post for the sake of postingThe problem is that too often, regardless of relevance, brands try to force an association with a topical holiday or calendar event just to have something to talk about on social media. Instead, companies and their agencies should be asking themselves three questions:Do my brand characteristics align with the holiday?What will the company gain by joining in the conversation?What will we lose if we don’t participate?With its focus on cultural diversity and pride, Heritage Day is a particularly sensitive occasion, and social posts risk provoking prickly keyboard warriors on Twitter and Facebook.

The last dinner or the 2019 National Braai Tour is going to be epic.

If you’re in doubt, stay out of the conversation. Alternatively, pair your post with information pertinent to your customers. For example, your Happy Holidays message at the end of the year can be more than well-wishing attached to a festive stock image. Include notification of changed office hours for the period.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/514484-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Fikret tozak on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">5 mistakes grown-up brand blogs shouldn't makeHere are five mistakes even grown-up brand blogs make...By Louisa Douwes Dekker 2 Sep 2019Walk the talk; prove that you’re a conscious companyWhere posting on notable days works is when a company’s real-world actions align with the occasion and do so consistently throughout the year. For example, Exxaro Resources’ Women in Mining initiative is an “always-on” project, uplifting women in a traditionally male-dominated industry. Efforts are communicated year-round across social and media channels, creating consistency on a conversation that makes messaging on Women’s Day a natural fit for the brand. We’re continually working towards ensuring a better environment and work culture for our female employees to empower and celebrate women working in a male-dominated industry. #Mining #Exxaro #WomenInMining #PoweringPossibility pic.twitter.com/oE55YVy1sg— Exxaro (@ExxaroResources) 22 February 2019Again, the communications aren’t hollow platitudes – they spotlight what Exxaro has done.It can’t be stressed enough: authenticity is key. People will look into what you say you do. A company can’t hop on a holiday bandwagon, talk about a topic for only one day and expect to be taken seriously.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/509693-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Oje Ojeaga, CEO/CCO at Up in the Sky, Nigeria and Loeries 2019 Digital Communication juror." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: "The most audacious campaign will not convert if your target audience can't relate" - Oje OjeagaI chatted to the regional jurors ahead of the upcoming Loeries Creative Week.

Such communications typically blend into the noise of the day, with everyone doing the same thing. Simply focus on what aligns with your company. And make sure what you have to say feels genuine as opposed to forced.
