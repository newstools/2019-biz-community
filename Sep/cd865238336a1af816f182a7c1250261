What does this win mean to you/for the agency?We at TBWA Hunt Lascaris aim to create iconic work for our clients that is culturally relevant to their consumers. This is an acknowledgement to us having achieved this. This was a really special win for us as it was first for South Africa in that a non-English script won a Grand Prix, making it truly iconic.We couldn’t be prouder, as we have committed ourselves to locating and involving brands into modern culture and these ads did just that. We are thrilled that they received the recognition that they deserve, so a big thanks to the judges and the Loeries for awarding it the highest prize.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/502748-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#CannesLions2019: Radio Lions winners!" width="120" height="120">#CannesLions2019: Radio Lions winners!The 66th annual Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity continued on 20 June with the 2019 Radio & Audio Lions announced during the Communication award ceremony, with SA once again roaring with metal!20 Jun 2019.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why do you think this campaign was deserving of such a win?These spots have great, contemporary insights that cross cultures. They embrace the human truth about going home for the holidays. They are beautifully written, in both English and Zulu, and have exceptional production values.They feel fresh in their execution-style and are a guiding light to the young writers out there who want to push their cultural insights into their work to make it distinctive..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us more about the thinking behind the idea for the campaign.This radio campaign has six spots and focuses on deep, cultural nuances in both the English and Zulu versions. When it comes to holidays and occasional travel, the City Lodge Group not only compete with other hotel chains and Airbnb, they compete with the homes of friends and family.The truth is, in tight-fisted economic times, many of us end up choosing the ‘free’ option.But how free is it really? Finances aside, there are some undeniable emotional and, sometimes, physical costs to staying with the people you love: looking after your ageing, haggard childhood pets and the constant, unrequited company – not to mention too much information about your parents’ sexual renaissance. When you weigh up the real cost of staying with family, staying at a City Lodge hotel is better than free, actually.We flighted these on traditional radio stations, specifically 94.7, but The City Lodge ‘The Real Cost of being Zulu’ radio ad breaks the mould in all aspects of radio advertising and how we traditionally advertise to black people. The driving insight for the campaign is to speak to Zulu people who grew up in rural or peri-urban South African areas, but due to work, or other reasons, go off to the CBDs of Johannesburg, Cape Town, and Durban.When these South Africans are back home, they might hear a predominantly Zulu radio station, such as Ukhozi FM, for instance. However, we recognised that when they are in the cities, they mostly engage with online and urban radio stations. With a limited budget, this is where we decided to launch our campaign for maximum effect, with an online radio burst just before the major holidays.Cliff Central is the biggest online radio station in South Africa, with a variety of popular hosts who appeal to young trend makers. We were able to disrupt the way marketers advertise to black people by not looking at them as isolated LSMs or monolingual beings. We also released our audio stories with subtitled videos as visual support, so that even those who don’t speak the language could still be entertained. We opted for a non-traditional radio medium to do this.The success of the campaign means that our client now has more of a budget to book media on big radio stations. The next burst of the campaign is around the December break and will feature traditional, but regional, radio stations as well.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507153-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Lanre Adisa, CEO/CCO of Noah's Ark Communications, Nigeria, and Loeries 2019 Live, PR and OOH juror." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: "No place for one-size-fits-all in truly relatable regional storytelling" - Lanre AdisaWith the year's biggest international award shows done and dusted, I chatted to the regional jurors ahead of the upcoming Loeries Creative Week.

It just means that we are finally understanding who we are as a people and embracing it, which makes me proud to see.A @loeries GRAND PRIX for @TBWAHunts and @citylodgegroup !! ����☠️�� #tbwaloeries2019 #loeries2019 pic.twitter.com/nw4VawORoS— TBWA\Africa (@TBWAAfrica) August 24, 2019.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the current creative landscape in South Africa and how this compares globally?On the positive side, we are embracing who we are as a country, and are really producing work that reflects our stories, aesthetics, cultures and society.
