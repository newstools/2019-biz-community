At the Primetime Emmy Awards, Game of Thrones won Best Drama, Chernobyl took home Best Limited Series and Fleabag was named Best Comedy.  In the three main narrative categories, five series on Showmax (Game of Thrones, Chernobyl, Barry, A Very English Scandal and Succession) won eight awards; two Amazon comedies (Fleabag and The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel) won six awards and three Netflix shows (Ozark, Pose and When They See Us) won four awards. Netflix also won Competition Programme (RuPaul’s Drag Race) and TV Movie (Black Mirror: Bandersnatch), putting them at six awards overall for the night.  This follows last week’s Sunday Times Top Brands Awards in South Africa, where Showmax placed ahead of Netflix and just behind DSTV Now in the Paid Streaming Service category.  The Emmy results are also in line with Rotten Tomatoes’ recent list of The Best TV Shows of 2019 So Far, which features eight titles on Showmax in its top 20, compared to five titles available on Netflix and one on Prime Video in Africa.  According to Variety, HBO was the overall Emmy winner, taking home 34 awards from 137 nominations across both weekends, followed by Netflix with 27 wins out of 117 nominations.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/518075-625x568.jpg" alt="Game of Thrones, Chernobyl, Fleabag win big at Emmys; Showmax has most winners" width="625" height="568">Best Drama: Game of Thrones sets recordsIn addition to winning Best Drama, Game of Thrones’ Peter Dinklage also won Best Supporting Actor for his role as Tyrion Lannister.
