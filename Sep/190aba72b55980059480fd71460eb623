Darren is also the host of a programme on Mix FM in Johannesburg, and the host of the weekend breakfast show on Bok Radio in Cape Town. “With such a heavy radio presentation schedule, understandably, Darren would need to relook his commitments, which OFM have accepted and respect his request and decision," says Nick Efstathiou, CEO of OFM's holding company, the Central Media Group. “The station wishes him well and thanks to him for the two-and-a-half years he spent entertaining the people of Central South Africa,” adds Efstathiou. The Afternoon Drive programme on OFM will be hosted by WR van der Merwe and Natasja Jacobs until the end of October 2019.
