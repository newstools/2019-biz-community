This line allows all kids to express themselves freely which is why it resonates so strongly with them. We’re hopeful Creatable World will encourage people to think more broadly about how all kids can benefit from doll play.”Mattel worked alongside a team of experts, parents, physicians and most importantly, kids, to create the new play experience.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1807/447821-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Beyond pink and blue: the quiet rise of gender-neutral toys" width="120" height="120">Beyond pink and blue: the quiet rise of gender-neutral toysAmid a downturn in global toy sales, Australia's Toys 'R' Us stores going into voluntary administration and closure of the firm's American and UK arms, a quiet revolution is under way in the toy world...By Jason Bainbridge 5 Jul 2018The Creatable World doll line consists of six different doll kits that are available in a variety of skin tones.
