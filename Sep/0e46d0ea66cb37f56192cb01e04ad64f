The partnership with SingularityU South Africa affords us the opportunity to stay on top these developments.AbsaWe are living in a time of extraordinary change and technological disruption. But one thing is clear: if this Fourth Industrial Revolution has the potential to ring in a new era of social progress and strengthened societies, we need to improve access to technology and educate everyone so they can fully benefit from the opportunities it opens up. Without a decisive plan for inclusivity at all levels of our society, this Revolution will fail the very people it should benefit the most. We are therefore excited to be a part of SingularityU South Africa’s journey as it embeds our commitment to partnering with different thought leaders to ignite change and redefine the future of our continent.About SingularityU South AfricaSingularityU South Africa is the seventh country partner of Singularity University and the first in Africa.
