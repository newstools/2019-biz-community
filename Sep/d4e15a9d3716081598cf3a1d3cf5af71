Reliability. “This is the brand promise reliable performance repeatably to the consumer,” she says.Insight (and empathy). “To enable the brand to make better offers. This is more important in some categories than others,” she says.Motive. “We are more likely to trust people who we think have fairness appreciation,” she says.Trust today in the post-truth society we are living in has made it an important currency. “Trust as an outcome of what your brand did is not good enough anymore; brands need to work harder at trust,” she says. To achieve this, she outlined the three I’s of trust: Integrity – “The golden thread of your brand, this is the consistent experiences across the brand journey. Nando’s and Discovery are two brands that do this very well,” she says.Identification – “Your brand must have something in common with consumers. This is the most human element of the three I’s and is about giving a face to the brand, but also about making yourself vulnerable,” she says.Inclusion – “This is about respect and sharing power.
