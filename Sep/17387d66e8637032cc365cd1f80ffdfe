Having to be able to live my dream because Telkom has always been a part of our lives and to be part of such an experience is mind-blowing. The brand and my brand work very seamlessly together, as you know, I started off with Youtube vlogs and Telkom offers free video streaming on their FreeMe packages.I am just so happy to be the one to elevate their brand to newer heights and I am looking forward to seeing the value over the next year.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/504230.jpg" alt="The youth have spoken!

I do not feel like I am working, I feel like I am living my life and getting paid to do so..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any career highlights you’re particularly proud of?Yes. Being announced as Telkom brand ambassador has to be the biggest of them all. I have never been a part of such a huge deal and it has elevated my career and sphere immensely. I started off as a vlogger and I didn’t know the magnitude of what I was doing is, I wouldn’t have imagined it to place me where I am today..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us a bit about your experience and how this has equipped you for your new position.Getting into the industry was not that easy, but, in the midst of all of that it taught me patience and, I think, my partnership with Telkom came at the right time even though, back then, I felt the rush to make it into the industry. All my experiences, good and bad, have taught me to appreciate this position that I’ve been put in and use it as a reminder to the young Moshe watching – that nothing is impossible. If you dream it, you’ll live it. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to/enjoying so far?I can’t wait to shoot the free me Comic-Con campaign, it looks very exciting. I’m also enjoying being a voice-over artist for Telkom as well as the fun I have when I’m shooting the adverts, it doesn’t feel like work but feels like I’m just living my life – it’s fun. I can tell you now, I’m not looking forward to this journey ending. The partnership has taught me so much, I am being introduced to technology in a very cool way..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s at the top of your to-do list (at work)?My radio gig as it’s in the morning and finessing life by the hour. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you currently reading/watching/listening to for work?Watching Dynasty on Netflix, it really keeps me on my toes..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us something about yourself not generally known?I’m quite a sensitive and soft person. People always see me making jokes, being loud and goofy and they think that nothing can hurt me. I’m human before I am an entertainer.You can follow Ndiki on the following social media platforms: Facebook | Twitter | Instagram or for more information, you can visit his website.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
