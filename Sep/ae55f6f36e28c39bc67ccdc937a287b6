The company’s service lines offer tailored bouquets, including specialised training, designed to resonate with ambitious businesses operating in the southern African marketplace. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516870-625x417.jpg" alt="Daniel Wilkinson, Head of Paid Media: Jellyfish" width="625" height="417">Daniel Wilkinson, Head of Paid Media: Jellyfish“We’ve moved on from being part of the new breed of digital agencies to being a digital partner.” explains Wilkinson, speaking from a recent thought leadership event hosted by the company in Johannesburg. “We’re now working with brands in an agency, consultancy, training and technology capacity.” What is in-housing? “In-housing can mean a lot of different things to each brand depending on their digital maturity,” says Tim Lombard, Jellyfish SA Managing Director. “Most brands will need their own unique combination of capabilities to fully meet their individual needs, so the in-house spectrum can range from entirely outsourced to fully owned and operated.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516871-625x391.jpg?1" alt="Google’s Digital Maturity Benchmark" width="625" height="391">Google’s Digital Maturity BenchmarkJellyfish uses the Digital Maturity Benchmark, developed by Google, to help brands identify their own position on the digital transformation journey, which is classified as being: nascent, emerging, connected or multi-moment.  Nascent - from a technology and media perspective, a brand sitting in the nascent phase will have access to some of the right technology, but probably wouldn’t own it and most of their digital activity would be outsourced.  Emerging - brands in this phase have most of the technology they need in place and they do own it. However, they probably still rely on a roster of agencies who use the technology and buy media on their behalf.  Connected - in-house capabilities extend to understanding the planning and execution of dynamic creative being used and brand-owned publisher deals are negotiated in some cases.  Multi-moment - clear expertise for planning dynamic creative, executed across multiple channels and optimised toward individual customer business outcomes and transactions. The In-house Agency Forum (IHF) reveals that the penetration of in-house agencies has increased by 52% in the last 10 years. “I guess the real question,” Wilkinson poses, “is not actually what is in-housing, but what to in-house?” The pros and cons - in-housing isn’t for everyone There are very real, bottom-line, reasons so many companies have made the decision to in-house their digital capabilities. Some of these include:  Financial - long-term cost savings and full transparency. Brands will know exactly where and how their budget spend is assigned for resources, technology and media. Many agencies still lack much-needed line of sight around media buying practices, one of the key drivers for in-housing programmatic display.  Strategic - again, looking from a strategic perspective, no one will know your brand as well as the people who live it every day. In-housing provides you with flexibility. Brands will no longer be wholly dependent on an agency roadmap that may not totally align with their commercial strategy.  Control - of your technology and particularly your data ownership, which gives brands the authority to decide how to use that data strategically. Getting started - six key elements required for your in-housing journey “Jellyfish understands that each business is at a different stage of the digital transformation process,” says Lombard, “which is why we offer a comprehensive range of short, medium and long-term stack management training solutions designed to facilitate your teams’ digitisation.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516872-625x429.jpg" alt="Tim Lombard, Managing Director: Jellyfish South Africa" width="625" height="429">Tim Lombard, Managing Director: Jellyfish South AfricaJellyfish recommends taking cognisance of the following, if you’re considering embarking on in-housing capabilities:  Evaluate your current media and creative performance as a benchmark.  Conduct a cost-benefit plan.  Create a priority plan (you don’t have to in-house everything all in one go).  Practice data-centricity and integrate multiple data sources into one place.  Establish what your current tech stack looks like, what you own and outline how your agencies should be using your technology.  Attract, retain, train and grow your in-house digital talent. When does it make sense to in-house? Strategy, operations, activation and optimisation, creative and analytics are proving to be the in-house capabilities offering the most return on investment.
