By recording what you want to achieve with mobile gaming, you will ensure a benchmark that is a measure of success agreed upon.” Nomacala Mpeta, head of learning Digify, says benchmarking is important for Digify as it allows them to understand whether a person is fit for upskilling, while Siyabonga Africa, South Africa Media Innovation Programme, says benchmarking allows them to measure the point from where their grantees start to the point where they are sustainable. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/492028-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Bookmarks2019: Transformation isn't just about your scorecard or employing more black people" width="120" height="120">#Bookmarks2019: Transformation isn't just about your scorecard or employing more black peopleHaving won the same award in 2017, Nomacala Mpeta, head of learning at Digify Africa, explains why they're proud to be recognised a second time for leading the push for transformation in digital and encourages more agencies and NGOs to recognise the need to do so as a business imperative in corporate SA...By Jessica Tennant 11 Apr 2019Jarred Cinman, CEO VMLY&R, says the advertising industry is in a period of mistrust. The trust levels between agencies and clients are very low.

Some brands are already spending a huge portion of their marketing budget in digital, and this is growing...By Jarred Cinman, Issued by IAB South Africa 1 Jul 2016Addressing work that wins digital in relation to benchmarking Cinman, who kicked off the event with a presentation “The truth about winning awards” says: “While benchmarking is a broad and serious topic, awards are only a thin sliver of what it means to do something good. However, awards are a big thing in the advertising industry and there are numerous award shows. “Pick which award shows you enter carefully. Awards matter, but only if they are credible. An awards show should have categories that have been meticulously crafted and are super clear. New technology should be considered as well as past entry volumes. Bear in mind some shows create profit,” he says. Also, look at the jury that will judge the work. “They should be recognised experts.” Cinman made the point that while winning awards can be good for your business, it is not the purpose of your business. It is okay to win awards but if you want to build a business, focus on what makes your clients money. That is all everyone really cares about.Further commenting on work that wins in digital winning work, fellow panellist, Emma Carpenter, group design director Fjord (Accenture), advises fish where the fish are. “Do work on existing platforms such as WhatsApp and Instagram. There is no point in producing work on a platform only 12 people are on.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/514480.jpg" alt="How to make the most of WhatsApp Business" width="120" height="120">How to make the most of WhatsApp BusinessYou probably depend on WhatsApp in your to day-to-day life, to keep in touch with friends and family.

That is the best way to do UX is to purpose build. How a website should look will only take you to a point.” Africa is excited that the industry is starting to appreciate the analytics. “I am keen to see where the next generation of data analytics will take us.” In conclusion, Cinman says: “Great work will surface. There is no perfect matrix; great work just stands out.” If you'd like more information on these events, visit the IAB SA website.
