In 2018 the Economist awarded the South African national anthem, Nkosi Sikelel ‘iAfrika, as the best anthem in the world, describing it as an act of musical healing. This sparked the idea for The Anthem Project, a digital first initiative created by the 24.com Brand Studio in partnership with News24 and OUTsurance.“The Anthem Project is truly South African. At a time when our country could do with some positivity, the goal was to unite South Africans through song” says Myles Brown, Head of 24.com Brand Studio.“As a truly South African brand, OUTsurance was proud to join News24 in bringing The Anthem Project to life. We couldn’t be happier with the positive impact it has made to our communities, our clients and even our staff. We’re incredibly excited about the good this initiative will continue to do for the charities nominated by the winners and look forward to seeing how their stories unfold” says Chris Potter, Creative Lead: Digital Marketing at OUTsurance.The Anthem project reached 1,2m unique users and generated 216 entries, double the campaign goal. Over 8m votes were cast for the favourite rendition of the anthem and the winners shared in R1m in cash and prizes going towards their nominated charities. News24 also won in the Best Use of Online Video category and secured a runner up prize in the Best Data Visualisation category. All the winners will head to the international Wold Digital Media Awards competition taking place in Spain in June 2020.
