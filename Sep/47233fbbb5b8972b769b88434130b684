The media owner has subsequently worked hard to put considerable distance between itself and its peers receiving many favourable comments among voters, particularly in the “knowledge” category of the online survey. One voter commented: “Their knowledge of the media industry is second to none, client relationship is amazing. When presented with a client brief, they go the extra mile with regards to research and presenting 360-degree solutions that are innovative.” Another said: “The Ads24 team goes above and beyond traditional newspaper print. They offer integrated solutions over multiple platforms and non-traditional print solutions. What sets them apart is their enthusiasm for innovation and the commitment of their team.” Marketing Services Award In addition, Ads24 was awarded first place for the coveted Marketing Services Award, receiving impressive scores across four criteria, namely: relationship building; marketing intelligence; trade marketing; and reputation management. The media owner claimed the title with repeated mention from voters about Ads24’s fun and educational events. One respondent said: “Their events are great fun and are educational too, whether it be about their titles or about the future of the world. Their Food for Thought event was a huge eye-opener.” Another agreed: “The campaigns rolled out to clients from ads24 are innovative, informative and entertaining. This makes it extremely valuable to their clients. Their Food for Thought events are mind-blowing.” A third voter had this to say: “Ads24 makes an incredible effort at all stakeholder levels to engage and inform not only our industry, but our clients as well. They go far beyond the muffin and a coffee.” The biggest compliment from a voter was: “Each year we are surprised by their innovative, interactive campaigns that support the sales force to achieve their goals.” Media24 scoops the lifestyle category In addition, Ads24’s sister company Media24 Lifestyle was awarded the Media Owner Magazine category for its excellent knowledge of its own titles and client’s brands. Media24 Lifestyle also came in second in the Media Owner category, with Ads24 coming in third. “We take the feedback we receive from the MOST Awards very seriously and do our best to respond proactively to positive and negative comments,” says Marise van der Lith, Brand Manager for Ads24. “The awards we won this year are testament to our hard work and dedication to continuously improve our service to our clients and to uphold excellence in the industry.” Remember to follow Ads24 @Ads24_News.
