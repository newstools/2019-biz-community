They are always caring and warm, which are all the attributes captured by MetropolitanRepublic in the National Lottery TV commercial.The National Lottery TV advert takes us through the journey of a grandfather who puts people’s needs before his own. He is always ready to help anyone who asks and people are seen going to his home for assistance.The generous hero in this commercial is seen using his bakkie to help drive members of the community from a nurse who is rushing to work; a woman in need of a ride home with her goat; to a lady going into labour who needs to be rushed to hospital.The ultimate punchline is that he gave a few people a lift to the local retailer, where one of them bought a lotto ticket that won the big jackpot. This is when destiny rewards the hero in this commercial.The key message in this advert is that doing good and helping others can have an enormous impact on how we view the value bring to our various communities. A grandfather in this video is seen helping his community from the goodness of his heart without expecting anything in return.This advert is a clear indication of ubuntu, in which “I am because you are.”Agency and team creditsAd title: The Driver Country: South Africa Client: Ithuba Holdings Creative Agency: MetropolitanRepublic Integrated Communications Account Manager: Nonhlanhla Shilabye Executive Creative Director:  Paul Warner Creative Director: Dikei Maloka Copywriter: Annette De Klerk and Dikei Maloka Art Director: Juliet Honey and Tsepo Makate Media planners: The MediaShop  Production Company: Star Films Recording Studio: Audio Militia Executive Producer: Adam Thal Music:  Mpoldol by Blick Bassy Edit and final mix: Howard Audio Final audio mix: Audio Militia Agency Producer: Mun Ying De Lacy Production: Grant Risseeuw Director: Tebza Malope Director of Photography: Willie Nel Production Art Director: Keenan McAdams Editor: Kobus Loots Post Production: Left Post Productions
