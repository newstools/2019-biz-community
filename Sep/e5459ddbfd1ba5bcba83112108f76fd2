View this post on Instagram           The truth is, as a country we do not have adequate resources and laws that will ensure accountability in regards to how we deal with violence against women and the immigration laws that are practically nonexistent. _________ The reality is, we have a migrant issue in our country, most of whom are not documented...we have immigration laws that are very limited thus far...we need to engage all relevant judicial stakeholders..reach out to the ILO..find ways of navigating the jurisdiction issues...engage the migrants countries of origin and begin practical and sustainable strides. ———— The fact is, violence against women and girls has been in existence for time immemorial ...sad but true! It’s a societal issue that calls for a country as a whole to stand against!! Educating women & girls of their rights is a start! Demanding stringent laws..ensuring that male counterparts are doing their part in all corners of the country in heading the call!! It takes all of us!!! ________ #westandwithwomen #femicide #womenslivesmatter #weareafrica #africaisus #shereigns #shematters #womensupportingwomen #women4women A post shared by  She Reigns (@shereigns.org.za) on Sep 5, 2019 at 4:23am PDT Gender equality is a powerful cause and one brave brands have already taken on, spurring a rise in cause-related marketing locally.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1803/432734-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image from the Carling Black Label #NoExcuses campaign." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Soweto Derby and Grey's Anatomy fight to end women abuseLast week, two SA brands notably planned ahead of International Women's Day with messaging that tied in on an extremely large-scale - Carling Black Label did so at the televised Soweto Derby, while 1st for Women made their move during a suitably themed episode of Grey's Anatomy...By Leigh Andrews 12 Mar 2018<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475596-120x120.png?2" alt="Cause-related marketing: Why we do it and where the value lies" width="120" height="120">Cause-related marketing: Why we do it and where the value liesIn a society such as ours, in such dynamic, developmental evolution, causes are the fuel that helps drive change.

There will be many hashtags, and powerful posts and sentiments today, and we wish the citizens that have taken to the streets  are safe, respectful and respected. Though we will all continue with business-as-usual tomorrow, we will not forget. These tragedies should start a national conversation and provoke a shift in consciousness.

Clearly, more needs to be done – fast.And while much of the country has been wearing black to demonstrate mourning, we’ve also raised our voices – with numerous protests already held to demonstrate we’re willing to fight back for our safety.The protest held outside parliament in the Cape Town CBD on Thursday, 5 September was particularly well attended – with South African president Cyril Ramaphosa finally making an appearance.

The male voice, in support of femalesGood Things Guy’s Brent Lindeque wrote that they were taking the platform offline for 48 hours to stand with females affected by violence in the country, spurring supporters to sign a petition demanding action from the powers that be, and things snowballed from there. This is more than just armchair activism, ‘clicktivism’ or ‘slacktivism’, where keyboard warriors are accused of signing petitions online and not taking any real action beyond that.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1707/402902-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Ioulia Bolchakova © –" width="120" height="120">#CSIMonth: Going beyond armchair activismThere's been a rise in criticism for only performing acts of good on Mandela Day, but there's a similar trend of eye-rolling at the clicktivism of keyboard warriors or ‘slacktivists'...By Leigh Andrews 24 Jul 2017Because while The Guardian reports that social media activism in particular is a weak form of effecting change, Everyday Feminism points out that “talking about a social issue online does at least do the job of spreading awareness, building community around a topic and educating those who may have the wool firmly tied around their eyes about the real world. “This has certainly been the case locally.

Femicide in South Africa. ⁣ ⁣ South Africa is currently facing a crisis of femicide: killing women just because they are women. This crisis is now at peak level due to the murder of 19 year old student Uyinene Mewetyana & a high level boxer. ⁣ ⁣ In South Africa, one woman is killed every 3 hours & it’s time for international media to start reporting on it.⁣ ⁣ Share this far & wide, so women in South Africa can stop wondering #aminext?
