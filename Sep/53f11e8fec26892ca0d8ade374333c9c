Image supplied.Big winners on the night were Samsung and Koo which were announced as South Africa’s Overall Favourite Brands, winning the Grand Prix Awards in the respective Business and Consumer sectors. Other Grand Prix winners included Vodacom, Nedbank and Coca-Cola. Shoprite was awarded as the first winner of the Proudly South African Brand Award in the consumer sector. The survey, conducted by Kantar on behalf of Tiso Blackstar Group and the Sunday Times, is considered the leading barometer of consumer sentiment towards brands in the country.Eben Gewers, head of advertising aales at Tiso Blackstar says: With twenty-one years of the Sunday Times Top Brands Survey under the belt, we’re proud of the contribution the results make in assisting brand strategists and marketers in refining their approach to the market. Understanding how consumers perceive a brand can have a significant impact in directing ad campaigns and messaging to optimise effectiveness, as well as resource and budget efficiencies.Kantar conducted face-to-face interviews with 3,500 adults in the metro and non-metro areas of South Africa in the Consumer sample. The Business sample represents businesses of all sizes, with 382 C-level decision-makers participating in online self-complete interviews. The final consumer results have been weighted to represent the population according to StatsSA 2018 mid-year population estimates. The methodology used to establish brand ranking and category winners is based on the concept of relative advantage. This takes brand familiarity and awareness, the perceptions of users and non-users, as well as the size of brand presence in the market into account. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517509-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Koo won Overall Favourite Brand in the consumer section." width="120" height="120">#TopBrands2019: Dishing up more loveIt was a night of consistency at the 21st Sunday Times Top Brands Awards held at The Venue, The Houghton Hotel last night. Koo won Overall Favourite Brand in the consumer section...By Danette Breitenbach 12 hours agoSamu Makhatihni, account director at Kantar says: “Samsung and Koo being the big winners is indicative of the changing consumer goods basket, and that both heritage and relatively new brands have the ability to be relevant and meaningful to consumers, in their own way. The proliferation of digital channels has created a myriad of opportunities for a direct brand economy (DBE), which has created an opportunity for all brands to act as digital natives, to be disruptive, and carve new paths to value in a consumer economy - creating new ways of marketing, new ways of connecting and new ways of competing.” Consumer categoriesKoo is a multiple winner of the Consumer Overall Favourite Brand Grand Prix - and once again took top spot in 2019. Coca-Cola and Whatsapp came in second and third place respectively. For the third year running, Coca-Cola received the Consumer Green Award, as well the Consumer Social Investment Award.
