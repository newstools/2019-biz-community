Gallagher Convention Centre used this opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to making a positive impact on the Midrand community by donating some much needed food and products to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals.The Midrand SPCA, run by the general manager Pam Pretorius, has recently been affected by burglary. Gallagher decided to make this gesture to demonstrate that as a community, we can make a difference in the Midrand area.According to Pam; "Donations will go a long way towards helping more animals in need."
