Those who have opened their doors to us, still charge monthly to stream unlimited music,” says Nwaogu.“We have been developing what will become Africa’s first real answer to Spotify. We at Playfre are trying to bring the over 45 million songs on Spotify to you at no charge, with the same Spotify experience and guess what? We did it.”Now, just four months since it debuted in app stores all across Africa, Playfre announced that it has successfully crossed the 1 million streams milestone.With a library of over 50 million songs and 2 million artists, Playfre is currently the largest African music streaming service in terms of catalogue size. It has grown steadily in the past few months; averaging around 250 streams per registered user.According to Nwaogu, music isn’t limited only to the just over 5,000 registered users on the platform – it’s freely available to anyone who downloads the app. However, he does note that Playfre is looking to restrict music streaming in a bid to increase to the number of registered users in the future.Playfre is the first African music streaming service to join the International Digital Media and Arts Association – an association dedicated to serving educators, practitioners, scholars, and organisations with interests in digital media.“We have been speaking with prospective investors lately and Playfre will soon go beyond being bootstrapped to become venture-backed,” says Nwaogu“Playfre wants to be more than just a music streaming service but also a platform that helps African artists monetise their creativity easily and freely too. We hope someday to also help African acts get their content on both local music streaming services in Africa and the rest of the world,” concludes Tosin Emmanuel, COO of Playfre.
