Botswana intends to fulfil the terms of the agreement and looks forward to a fruitful partnership with South Africa regarding all matters of standards development, conformity assessment and related matters,” said Masego Marobela managing director of BOBS.“Regional partnerships are important for cementing relationships, sharing resources and building capacity. Such collaborative agreements strengthen ties with our neighbours and will contribute to investment-led trade and regional industrial integration, in which the harmonisation of standards must play and important part,” said Garth Strachan, acting CEO of SABS.
