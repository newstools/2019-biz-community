<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515802.jpg" alt="Vital Health Foods launches revamped digital offering" width="400" height="400">Since appointing Realm Digital as digital partner, the brand has embarked on the journey of reinventing their current digital offering.The process started with a relaunch of the Vital Health Foods website, designed and developed by Realm Digital. The intent of the design was to create a site that is user friendly and offers all the features that users need to be able to quickly find and purchase products, giving Vital that desired competitive edge. To further enhance the online customer experience, product suggester functionality in the form of the Vital Vitamin Advisor was implemented. The Vitamin Advisor allows Vital Health to recommend three products based on a user’s answers and help their consumers make informed purchasing decisions. The Vitamin Advisor helps you find the Vital products best suited to your needs. The latest offering is the Vital Health Academy, an online academy that enables you to empower yourself with up to date research on how vitamins, minerals and herbs can improve your everyday health. A user enrolls, completes their modules of choice, and walks away with a certificate of completion, as well as the knowledge required to make better decisions around your family’s health. “Not only does Realm Digital deliver great digital solutions, I also enjoy working with them. Everyone in this company has a passion to see work get executed excellently and they also put the customer first. They want to see Vital succeed just as much as we do,” says Vital Health Foods Digital Marketing Manager and Product Specialist, Michelle Jooste.This reimagined digital offering has reaffirmed Vital’s customer-centric approach by providing a slick and efficient digital brand experience. “The vitamin and supplement industry has become heavily bogged down in contradictions, confusing messaging and “snake oil”. Vital Health Foods aims to simplify and demystify family health by making this knowledge accessible and easy to understand. Realm Digital is incredibly excited to be walking this journey with such a well-known South African brand, and seeing how the digital channels can help the brand,” says Realm Digital CEO, Simon Bestbier.
