We have a lot of water, and we need a couple of thirsty horses to join us at the river. But... we are a tribe of unicorns, because the work we do is magical and niche, and out-of-the-box. It is communication in all its glory as an art and a science.The question is: “Are you a thirsty unicorn?”DevCom is an international award-winning consultancy that uses the power of communication to change companies, individuals and communities, to deliver business results and social impact.#findyourtribe #devcomunicorn #devcomishiring #CommunicationConsultant<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516466.jpg" alt="DevCom is hiring!

We work smart and we play hard. We blow bubbles. We dress up, occasionally, and we care for ourselves. We value diversity, so our tribe include men, women, all races, all religions, and many tribes, from many different regions. We all have one thing in common: a love for our country and continent, fueling the passion for the people we work with. We do fieldwork in rural areas and deliver business results in boardrooms. We do research as a non-negotiable point of departure. We serve several multi-national corporate clients with excellence.Candidate requirementsYou have to: Have a suitable qualification in communication or business studies.

An internal locus of control, and the ability to work towards long-term results.
