Chris BothaThis week we go behind the selfie with Chris Botha, group managing director of Park Advertising - the holding company for Meta Media and The MediaShop...By Leigh Andrews 6 Mar 2019People doing business with peopleI always talk about the four legs of a chair where the creative agency, media agency, media owner and client are the four legs. All four are equally strong and important. In the same way, if a client tells you that you re doing a great job, it is equally important the media owner says you are doing a great job.Being named Media Agency of the Year is a big award to win, he adds. “We don’t deal with other media agencies, so we don’t know where we stand so this is a way of figuring out where we are. The Award tells us we are doing something right.” He believes that they are doing the fundamentals right. “Making sure that every media owner is your partner and that you treat them as a partner, giving them access to your building, to your people, looking after them, talking to them and educating them. It’s not brain surgery; it’s people doing business with people,” he says. The customer is kingThis is the second year that AdColony has won the Most Awards’ Media Owner of the Year. Andrew Kramer, MD of AdColony South Africa says this is very gratifying because the Award is determined by your clients and peers voting for you. “To win the Awards two years in a row shows us that we are moving in the right direction,” he says. He attributes their success to a passionate, hardworking team inspired by their head of sales, Michael van Tonder. We are very customer-centric and believe the customer is king. We are also nimble - we have to be as we compete with all the big guys such as Facebook and YouTube.Alphabet Soup is a three-time winner of the Specialist Media Agency Award. Nicolette Lewin, CEO and founder of the Alphabet Soup, says winning this year took hard work as the category included all agencies that specialise, from digital to outdoor and radio, etc. Our success is our approach to continuously engage with our partners. We are always pushing the boundaries and looking for opportunities to innovate.The agency also works with clients that do not have big budgets but still want innovation and something different in their media strategy that gets the numbers. “It’s all about ROI at the end of the day,” she says. Media Agency LegendThe evening focused in particular on women and of the seven individual awards, six were awarded to women.

We are formulating a plan within our business and will ensure that women in South Africa and across the continent have a voice.” Rowlands adds that there are still not enough senior women in the industry. “I also set out to ensure that Dentsu Aegis has the best network across the region, so my work is not done.” Tribute to Sandra GordonThe evening also paid tribute to Sandra Gordon, the mastermind behind the Most Awards. “I have so enjoyed being part of the Most Awards and every time I have stood up here and seen the comradery and the togetherness of the industry, I am very proud of you all,” she said to a standing ovation at the end of the evening.
