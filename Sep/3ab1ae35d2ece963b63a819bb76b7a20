It seems the awards have done their bit in both raising awareness and resulting in action, as then-Minister in the Presidency Responsible for Women, Susan Shabangu, said in 2017 that South Africa is on course to achieve 50% women representation.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1703/385109-120x120.jpg?2" alt="SA on course to achieving 50% women representation" width="120" height="120">SA on course to achieving 50% women representationMinister in the Presidency Responsible for Women, Susan Shabangu, says South Africa is on course to achieve 50% women representation before 2030...23 Mar 2017Shabangu was addressing the 61st Session of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women in New York at the time, and mentioned that the SA government had amended the Employment Equity Act to achieve equity in the workplace.

Colleen Larsen, president of the 30% Club Southern African Chapter said at the 2018 gala event:While we are still a long way from achieving gender parity, there has been steady progress in the last few years and there’s a growing recognition that gender diversity makes good business sense.

For example, Triple Eight won in the categories of empowering women in communities and investing in young women. Other categories include number of women on boards, empowerment of women in the workplace, equal representation and participation and positive role models. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Love that. Looking at what still needs to change, what's the biggest challenge agencies face when it comes to equality today – both internally and in the work created? The marketing and advertising industry as a whole faces significant underrepresentation of women, particularly in key management and decision-making positions. This is the case, despite the fact that globally 80% of consumer purchase decisions are made by women. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1711/421079.jpg" alt="Brands: Meet the #UntaggableForce" width="120" height="120">Brands: Meet the #UntaggableForceAn ability to embrace the #UntaggableForce will be key for brands determined to flourish in the adapt-to-survive reality characterising global and local consumer markets today.By Megan Bowman 30 Nov 2017Whilst we see that there are many more women in the industry in junior and mid-management, for most agencies it’s men who are on the executive committees or in the lead positions.This problem has many aspects to it:A lack of opportunities for women to rise through the ranks – whilst we come from a history of patriarchy in the industry, I believe that there is a more genuine intention today to give women more opportunities in senior positions. However, the intention needs to be followed up with more progressive policies to make women leadership a stronger reality.Lack of confidence from women to aim for these roles – as women, we need to back ourselves and each other more strongly. When we were interviewed for the Gender Awards recently, the panel of interviewers commented to me on how many candidates listed confidence and self-belief as one of the primary factors they felt were key to their ability to attain leadership positions.A working environment that is not mum-friendly – the industry has a reputation for burnout culture, demanding deadlines and working into all hours of the day and night.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511926-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: Is 40 hours a week enough?

And Triple Eight itself has a purpose in empowering women. With more than 80% of purchase decisions globally being made by women, we believe the marketing industry needs to be more reflective of this.
