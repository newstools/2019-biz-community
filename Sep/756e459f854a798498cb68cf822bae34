Nikiwe Mkhabela, Liberty Two Degrees’ Asset Management Executive of Sandton City, says: “Sandton City is delighted to welcome Jacaranda FM to the precinct and looks forward to this dynamic collaboration and the opportunities for the centre, our tenants, shoppers, and for Jacaranda FM listeners. Sandton City has nurtured the relationships it has made through the many collaborations and partnerships it has had in the past and looks forward to future ventures with iconic brands. Jacaranda FM is just that, an iconic brand and image.” Kevin Fine of Jacaranda FM discussed the strategy behind the Sandton City and Jacaranda FM partnership: “This collaboration marks the next step in the evolution of Jacaranda FM, taking us into the heart of Joburg on a regular basis to engage consumers, provide broadcast opportunities for tenants, and provide strong retail offerings for Sandton City shoppers. The key is in the mobility of the studios and the ability to be where the action is at any time. The mobile studio will give us the ability to move around Sandton City on demand and bring the station – events, promotions, activations and client campaigns included – face to face with consumers. We are humbled with the trust placed in us by Sandton City and look forward to building a long-standing, highly successful relationship with them.” Jacaranda FM’s award-winning line-up, including Martin Bester, Elana Afrika-Bredenkamp, Alex Jay and Rian van Heerden, will be part of the team regularly broadcasting live from Sandton City! Key emphasis is being placed on broadcasting that is tailored to consumer and client needs. For more updates, stay tuned to Jacaranda FM and www.jacarandafm.com.
