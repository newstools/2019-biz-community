The agency was briefed by Toyota SA’s advertising manager, Zhandre Brandt, to up the ante on previous campaigns. “Toyota fans selected to take on the challenge, which takes place in October, know they’ll have to work really hard. Communication needs to, therefore, demonstrate the enormity of the task, but do so in a way that inspires participation,” she said.“The 2016, 2017 and 2018 editions of the Fortuner 4x4 Challenge generated tremendous engagement with Toyota and Fortuner fans; we wanted the agency to do more this year. A difficult task, but one the team has delivered on.”This year’s campaign – a 360° communications solution comprising four 15-second TVC’s showing off a unique skill for each of the four heroes, a 40-second TVC and Cinema ad featuring all four heroes, radio, out-of-home, print, and online elements – was created by Creative Director Tian Van Den Heever, Art Directors Janine Kleinschmidt and Fezi Mpembe, Copywriter Bonginkosi Luvuno and Digital Content Lead Lucy Holford-Walker.It features this edition’s heroes Olympic rower Kirsten McCann, choreographer and fitness instructor Nkateko ‘Takkies’ Dinwidy, Cheetahs rugby player Oupa Mahoje and Toyota Dakar racing hero Giniel de Villiers performing bigger stunts in more intense environments than in previous years.To amplify the Challenge, the campaign also shows how – by backing their favourite hero using one of the four hero hashtags (#OUPA4X4, #TAKKIES4X4, #GINIEL4X4 or #KIRSTEN4X4) on any of the official social posts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram – the Toyota community can stand a chance to win a second Fortuner 4x4. ‘Back Your Hero’ entries can also be done via the competition website (www.fortuner4x4challenge.co.za) or by dialing the USSD string.The campaign was filmed at Hennops off-road trail over two days for the television elements and two days for the print work.
