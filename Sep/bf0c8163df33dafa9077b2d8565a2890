To bring together those leaders in cinematography whose achievements in that field entitles them to membership in this society, and to strive to maintain the highest possible standards, and that membership in this Society may become a mark of honour and distinction based on merit.  The SASC Visible Spectrum Awards celebrate and acknowledge the very best work produced by South African cinematographers. This is the only opportunity for cinematographers to show off their work, innovation and personalised styles and to see how it rates with their peers. It is also a chance to promote talent with the decision-makers of the South African film and television industry. Recognition by members of the SASC is the highest honour that can be bestowed on a South African cinematographer, a mark of prestige and distinction.
