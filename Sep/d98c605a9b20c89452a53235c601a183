I’m also fortunate to do so with an incredible bunch of highly-talented people, who never allow me to settle or sit down for too long!7. What are the tools of your trade? Our most critical tool currently is our in-house insights department. It allows us to constantly be immersed within culture and the minds of the consumers influencing it. We utilise these insights to build strategies that effectively influence behaviour and place our clients at the forefront of culture.

Who is getting it right in your industry? I’m a huge fan of the work Wieden & Kennedy are doing. They consistently produce work based on insights that tap into the cultural zeitgeist. BETC in Paris are also doing some cool things.9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. I think there are two main pain points: The billing structures within advertising need to be relooked. Currently, we sell hours, where our real value is in the ideas we generate, and the impact these ideas have on our clients’ businesses. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1708/405727.jpg" alt="Billing on outcomes versus hours" width="120" height="120">Billing on outcomes versus hoursWhen it comes to revenue models for advertising agencies, charging for time isn't the only way to bill a client. In fact, there's a far better way for an agency to bring in revenue that benefits the client at the same time...By Phillip Britz, Issued by Urban Espresso 10 Aug 2017At the same time, a more effective way of measuring the impact of these ideas and accountability would assist in justifying a different billing structure.10. What are you working on right now? We’re currently working on a couple of very exciting global projects across various sectors, from alcohol to energy, as well as some local projects across disciplines with some very exciting new sponsorship-thinking rolling out.11. Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. Influencer marketing is still a key buzzword flying around both locally and globally, but there seems to be a significant lack of understanding of how it works, the value it can add and how to do it properly. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/514043-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Thijs Slootjes on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Give the people what they want: How influencer marketing is changingBabalwa Nyembezi on authenticity, influencer marketing and co-creation...By Babalwa Nyembezi 29 Aug 2019We prefer to talk influence marketing and how you can use the power of influence to effect real change and have a significant impact.

Where and when do you have your best ideas? Always in the shower… not sure if it’s because it’s the only time I get some quiet time, as a young dad, or if it’s the sound of the water.13. What’s your secret talent/party trick? I can pick up a wine bottle cork or champagne cork from the floor without using my hands or bending my legs.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515894.jpg" alt="McFadyen captions this: &amp;quot;Friday night weekend celebrations with champagne and ‘kiddie champagne’, more commonly known as Appletiser.&amp;quot;" width="625" height="470">McFadyen captions this: "Friday night weekend celebrations with champagne and ‘kiddie champagne’, more commonly known as Appletiser."14.
