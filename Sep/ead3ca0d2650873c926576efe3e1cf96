The biggest detractor being: "I am just going to stay in my lane. I am going to do the best that I can in only what I am supposed to do."Follow the yellow brick road Despite the kudos that goes out to junior PR practitioners doing this, I can with confidence say that staying in one's lane leads to one path – a passion-less, unfulfilled, dead-end profession.Why? Because in any industry – but more so – in the communications industry being a 'Jack' or 'Jane' of all trades is the new master of multi-exposing (self-descriptor to explain exposing oneself to the acquisition of many skills to advance within an industry, trade or career path) oneself.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513616.png" alt="Brave Decisions by Brave Women: Tumi Rabanye, strategic director, The Brave Group" width="120" height="120">Brave Decisions by Brave Women: Tumi Rabanye, strategic director, The Brave GroupIn this instalment of the "Brave Decisions by Brave Women" series, Tumi Rabanye, strategic director at The Brave Group talks to us about her journey and key moments in her life which led her to where she is today...Issued by The Brave Group 27 Aug 2019By the way, I did not use the word multi-skilling because, in all honesty, you can never be a master of concentrating diligently on a pot of urgent tasks and achieve maximum success on all of them.Boxing oneself with "I only get paid to media monitor" or "I am just an account manager, it is not my job" will very quickly set you up for professional and team failure.

Just show me how."You will be amazed at what talents and PR skills you have hidden inside of you, which make you adaptable and transferable!
