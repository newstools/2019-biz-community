Starting on Monday, 30 September, the show will air between 3pm and 6pm weekdays and promises to be both informative and entertaining. The new team is set to bring in their fresh, energetic and versatile characters to the show. The duo will be joined by Nomfundo Clarissa who returns to traffic reporting and as a contributor to the show. Announcing the new show, Gagasi FM Programmes Manager Mimi Kesaris said the two presenters fit in perfectly with the brand and are not new to the KZN audience. “Their track record is unquestionable and the combination promises exciting times ahead. Nomalanga’s career kicked off at the station a few years ago and she returns “home” having grown as a brand and looking forward to getting behind the mic again. Equally talented, DJ Warras is returning to his home province after cutting his teeth in Jozi across various stations. We are confident that we have the perfect combination for the show, and that our listeners will love it,” says Kesaris.Other than their impressive radio credentials, both presenters have also presented various television shows with Nomalanga having been with BET since 2017 and DJ Warras having presented Live-Amp on SABC 1 as well as The Man Cave on SABC 3. This new show is set to take the station’s multi-channel content offering to the next level with its features and consumer interactions. Over and above the traditional radio platform, the show will also extend to online channels as well as on the ground through activations and consumer engagements. DJ Sonic, who has been standing in on the afternoon drive in the past few weeks, will return to his normal slot weekdays between 10am and 1am.
