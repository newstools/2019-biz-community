After successfully creating an installation on the promenade that recreated the African Sun indoors, we looked to continue the Absa presence at the Africa installment of the World Economic Forum.This year, Grid explores ideas around an affordable, inclusive and connected African city by providing an interactive augmented reality (AR) experience using an area of downtown Johannesburg in South Africa as an example.David Cohen, CEO and partner at Grid Worldwide, explains: "This is intended to spark debate and conversation around why we need to be future-thinking and look to tomorrow to solve our most urgent present-day challenges."The installation, on display at the Absa Dome on the sidelines of WEF Africa in Cape Town, aims to showcase how themes and technologies in 4IR could positively impact the lives of Africa’s citizens.“How do we leverage our need to urbanise to create jobs, and opportunities for upskilling and continuous reskilling, as we continue to evolve and automate?” asks Yatish Narsi, Grid Worldwide’s experience officer and partner. There are many questions to both ask and answer, but it starts with us committing to the potential of what this technological revolution has to offer. It starts with us committing to join the conversation and shape inclusive growth in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.David Cohen describes how this is the third time Grid has worked with Absa on a large-scale project, and how Grid Worldwide’s operating model ‘Investment Creative’ unlocks the key to creating creative value for clients through purpose delivery on meaningful change in society.
