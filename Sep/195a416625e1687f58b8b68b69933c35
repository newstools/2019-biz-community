Under Gallarelli’s leadership, Ogilvy South Africa tied with TBWA to be named Creative Circle Agency Group of the Year 2018. Gallarelli’s ability to drive growth, build and lead powerhouse teams, and establish trusted relationships across his agency and client partners puts him in an exceptional position to lead TBWA’s trailblazing agencies across South Africa. Sean Donovan, President, TBWA\Asia, and former Group CEO of TBWA\South Africa, said, “We are delighted to have Luca coming on board to lead the Group. He excels at creating environments where creativity can thrive, and understands the needs of both smaller, entrepreneurial companies and complex multinationals. He’s going to be a fantastic leader for clients, our people and our product. Most importantly, he is the right cultural fit - he’s ‘one of us.’”Troy Ruhanen, CEO, TBWA\Worldwide, said, “Luca’s passion for creativity coupled with his business acumen fits the TBWA mold perfectly. He is the ideal successor to Sean, and we can’t wait for him to join our world-class South African Group.” Topçuoğlu added, “Luca is a trusted partner to clients and creatives. He has consistently been a catalyst for innovation and has an innate belief in the power of disruption, evident through the work he’s been part of over the years. We are thrilled to have him build on our strong position in South Africa.” This appointment comes at a time of positive momentum for the TBWA\South Africa Group.

Says Gallarelli: “TBWA has always stood out as a collective supremely confident in who it is and what it represents. Uncompromising in the talent that it attracts. Uncompromising in the quality of relationships that it fosters with its clients. And uncompromising in its quest for creative excellence. As someone who is deeply passionate about the creative product, this is something that I want to be a part of. Furthermore, the opportunity to work across a group of outstanding companies with an unparalleled breadth of capabilities and the proven ability to integrate was too compelling to pass up. I am humbled at the opportunity to be a part of this iconic agency collective’s story.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515694-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Gallarelli to leave Ogilvy" width="120" height="120">Gallarelli to leave OgilvyOgilvy South Africa is bidding farewell to Group Managing Director Luca Gallarelli, as the industry leader takes leave of the agency 17 years after he first joined...Issued by Ogilvy & Mather 1 day agoAbout TBWA\WorldwideTBWA is The Disruption® Company: the cultural engine for 21st-century business.
