But character brand licensing should be used within a companies’ strategic marketing strategy to increase sales and margins.Here’s how  This is the accepted model for measuring the value of a product to its target market: The value of a product or service to a buyer =  Performance⁄Price Increase the “performance” or “lower the price of a product” and the value to the customer/buyer increases.And makes it more attractive to purchasers, than a competitors’ product.We are in the age of parity products and as a result, it is very difficult to gain a market advantage and add customer value by increasing “performance” or decreasing “price”.This is where character licensing plays a vital role.
