Picture © Goethe-Institut South Africa.“Defending the rights of journalists is about the right of freedom of expression in South Africa and Germany,” says Martin Schäfer, the German Ambassador to South Africa, in his address to guests to the Future of Journalism Series, Part 1: Media Credibility. Sector in declineThe event, held at the Goethe-Institut, which also hosted the event together with Embassy of the Federal Republic of Germany and Media Monitoring Africa, discussed the topic through a panel facilitated by the SABC’s Tsepiso Makwetla. Panellist, Holger Stark, Die Zeit & Zeit Online, Germany, says while we live in the best of times, there is no question that journalism is in a crisis. “This is not a South African problem, but a worldwide one. Journalism circumstances have changed dramatically, and the sector is in decline.” The collapse of journalism is also indicative of the society we live in, says Chris Vick, spin doctor and media strategist. “There is an ethical collapse in South African society - think of the Tiger Brands, KPMG and McKinsey scandals. As South Africans we are affected by these scandals,” he says. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1803/434670-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Tiger Brands' failed attempt to manage the listeriosis crisis is costing them severely" width="120" height="120">Tiger Brands' failed attempt to manage the listeriosis crisis is costing them severelyFailing to plan for a reputational crisis happens more often than it is comfortable to think about.

The problem is that over 70% of people cannot distinguish between real and fake news,” she says Stark points out that this is exactly why journalists must distinguish themselves. Journalists must not add to the noise out there. They need to take the time to check facts. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511174-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Elijah O'Donnell on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Sanef's media credibility and ethics inquiry looks to review editorial systems, practicesSince its launch in June, the South African National Editors' Forum's (Sanef) Inquiry into Media Credibility and Ethics has received submissions from journalists and members of the public...13 Aug 2019Panellist, Dr Glenda Daniels, Wits Media Studies, says while the sector is doing a good job, as stories such as the Gupta Leaks prove, journalists must agree that there is a credibility problem. “All journalists have an agenda, but if you deal with the facts and move away from the social media space the sector can get its credibility back.”Guided by the press codeShe adds that social media and blogging are not journalism. Public relations (PR) officers are also calling themselves journalists. They are not and we need to separate journalism from these activities.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/489377-120x120.jpg" alt="Mozambique rescue effort. Credit:

Therefore, we need to be held to that standard. We must be guided by the press code to provide news that is true, fair and accurate. This is the standard journalists must hold themselves accountable to.Vick agrees. “In any society, the role of the media is to hold the powerful accountable. That must make us humble, not the elite of a society.”
