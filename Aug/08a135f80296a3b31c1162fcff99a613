PAMRO was founded on an express interest to better the media, marketing and advertising industries across Africa by sharing knowledge and creating a uniform research infrastructure. By aligning research methodologies, members of the industry can make informed decisions about how to reach, and communicate with, certain target markets.The annual conference is an opportunity for industry players across the continent to network and share knowledge, as well as fund bursaries to two media-studies students, valued at $2000 each; as well as an opportunity for these students to attend the conference and meet leaders in their chosen professions.This year’s conference takes place in Flic en Flac, Mauritius, and as a result, two Mauritian students, Ashwinee Rajkoomar of Middlesex University Mauritius, and Shameema Peeroo of Curtin Mauritius, are the proud recipients of the bursaries.
