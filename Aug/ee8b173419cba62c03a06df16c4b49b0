So who better to judge on the 2019 Loeries’ Digital Communication work, under Google Digital Communication Category jury president Tara McKenty?<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496774-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Tara McKenty - creative director for Google APAC and Google digital communication jury president for Loeries 2019." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: "The responsibility to use creativity and craft for social good" - Tara McKentyI chatted to the international jury presidents ahead of the upcoming Loeries Creative Week.

Starting the agency during Nigeria’s first recession in 25 years was a struggle indeed.

I would also say, being the only Nigerian agency to win at the Loeries in 2018 – in what was essentially our second year – was quite fulfilling for the entire agency.

Let’s extend that theme of excitement to what makes you excited about brand communications? What new skills and technologies do you see coming through in media and advertising right now? Our industry is in a season of flux that can make even the brave worry. However, massive change is usually a harbinger of opportunities. The takeover of traditional media platforms by all things digital will require us to think and create with a digital-first consumer in mind. I find this quite exciting. Being comfortable with technology should be the default response for a true creative.          View this post on Instagram           The best copywriters know.

I’d say the work is quite similar. Nigerian creatives continue to evolve and discover new ways to include cultural nuance in campaigns for brands..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}That’s for sure. What kind of innovation and creative work will you be then looking for as a judge of the Loeries 2019? I’m looking out for work that shows a team went beyond the obvious in solving a communication challenge.Creativity that serves a purpose. Creativity that tackles big, bold themes or shows brilliant simplicity. I want to see work that not only challenges me to be a better creative, but work that sets a new standard for any festival, anywhere in the world.I think that is every judge’s dream. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Do you think the tenets of a successful media campaign are universal? What makes a campaign work in your country? I believe the most important core element of a successful media campaign is relatability. The most audacious campaign will not convert if your target audience can’t relate. This is just as true in Nigeria, where messaging is often analysed and dissected, both online and off.

It must be relatable in that way the best campaigns often are – comfortingly familiar, while dazzling us with something new. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to from Loeries Creative Week 2019?
