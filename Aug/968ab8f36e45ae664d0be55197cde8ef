Its members are UWC students who are driven, committed, trained and mentored by media experts to create and promote a professional media environment that ensures the sustainability of the project by securing, over the long-term, the services of a full-time station manager for radio. The Media Society’s Board of Directors consists of students, media experts and representatives from neighbouring communities. Earlier this year, UWC and the SABC signed a partnership agreement which assisted the UWC Media Society to enhance the student experience by developing media and broadcasting skills. The partnership between UWC, SABC Western Cape and Good Hope FM will include on-the-job observation in newsrooms and radio studios.
