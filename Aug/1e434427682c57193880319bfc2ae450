Careers should begin on campus, not after graduation, and opportunities like these truly help broaden students’ perspectives of industries and prepare them for the complex world of work.” The Microsoft Design Expo was established to ensure that technology becomes part of curriculums at design schools worldwide. More than 50 design schools have already participated since the Expo was established in 2010, with Vega being the first school in Africa to take part. “The Microsoft Design Expo provides students with a platform to share ideas that will make a big impact on the world around them, encouraging them to think outside of the curriculum to understand how design can make a difference,” says Lillian Barnard, Microsoft South Africa Managing Director. “It’s also a great stepping-stone for students as it puts them in a position to launch their careers long before they graduate.” To find out more about the Microsoft Design Expo, visit www.microsoft.com/.
