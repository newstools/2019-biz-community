And how do you measure the effectiveness of a leader? Can you put two people side by side and instantly tell which is the more effective leader based just on their looks? Gilan Gork, South Africa’s foremost Mentalist, bestselling author of Persuasion Games and founder of The Influence Institute, was invited by NATO to address global leaders on the key ingredient to developing effective leaders.The focus of the conference was on strategic communications and given Gilan’s unique insights as an expert mentalist, he delivered powerful methods for creating swift, effective influence without ever having to compromise values.Conducting the opening keynote, presenting directly after the President of Latvia, His Excellence Raimonds Verjonis, Gilan shared his wealth of experience in the field of influence psychology, to 650 delegates and leadership from over 40 countries.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513851-625x388.png" alt="Why NATO is so interested in this simple influence model and how you can use it to transform your leadership today" width="625" height="388">Your effectiveness as a leader is capped by your influence abilityGilan tells us that a leader’s job is to achieve goals with their team, by growing people and helping them achieve high-performance consistently. Leaders can have good ideas but their ability to influence others to buy into their ideas is often even more important than the idea itself. The inability to positively influence others is often the reason why so many businesses and leaders are faced with failure. Here’s an excerpt from Gilan’s NATO talk, where he shares a story about this:The secret ingredient to developing effective leadersNot long into his keynote, Gilan introduces the secret ingredient that all leaders and aspiring leaders need to focus on, which is their ability to practice Transformational Influence.The term, Transformational Influence (coined by Gilan), refers to one’s ability to influence positive change within themselves and others, so that they may lead their team to victory.“Your effectiveness in leading your team to superior results is capped by your ability to influence each person to participate and perform at their best”, Gilan explains.This was music to the ears of NATO’s esteemed delegates, as they all strive to lead their teams to victory.The catch is, no one wants an overly complicated process to develop their leadership ability. Like the great Leonardo da Vinci once said, “simplicity is the ultimate sophistication”.Gilan’s model to achieving higher levels of influence delivers on this wish and it’s called the Rapid Influence Formula.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513852-625x281.png" alt="Why NATO is so interested in this simple influence model and how you can use it to transform your leadership today" width="625" height="281">It came as no surprise when the official NATO StratCom press release spoke of Gilan’s Formula as the highlight of the session due to its versatile application, simplicity and value to positively influence nations: “One of the conference highlights was mentalist Gilan Gork, who interactively demonstrated a remarkable ability to decode and influence people’s thoughts and showed how one can increase levels of trust, credibility, and influence.”Gilan also contributed as an expert panellist on the topic ‘Informed or Influenced? The Art of Decision-Making’ alongside Prof. Michael Platt from The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, and Jan Engelmann, Professor of Neuroeconomics at The University of Amsterdam.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513853-625x417.jpg" alt="Why NATO is so interested in this simple influence model and how you can use it to transform your leadership today" width="625" height="417">Influence can be learntAlthough it’s true that some people are born with greater natural gifts than others, the ability to influence is really a collection of skills, nearly all of which can be learned and improved.No matter your current level of influence, you can vastly improve your leadership effectiveness by learning how to create Transformational Influence using the same influence formula Gilan presented for NATO. In Gilan’s journey, developing solutions for clients in over 30 countries, he had to learn how to deliberately increase his influence in positive ways. He had a mission to ‘deconstruct’ influence and leadership, which resulted in the inception of his globally acclaimed Rapid Influence Formula. Here is a short video, where Gilan explains his Rapid Influence Formula.While Gilan is already a best-selling author and global presenter in over 30 countries, presenting a keynote for NATO on his Rapid Influence Formula was certainly a career highlight for him, and demonstrates how South Africa is able to produce thought-leaders who shape the world.As a result of Gilan’s global reach as a keynote speaker and impactful approach to developing positive influence, he is regularly hired by companies to work on their Transformational Influence development, primarily to help improve results in areas of leadership, sales and negotiation.
