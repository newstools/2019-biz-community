But not everyone knows that. What women believe they know, is that hair relaxers can cause breast cancer. Or that caffeine can give you breast cancer. These myths don’t have an ounce of truth in them. Fact. Breast cancer is shrouded in misconceptions and myths which ultimately have resulted in stigma around the disease. This stigmatisation has stoped women form getting the medical help they need. Jet is a fashion retailer with a brand purpose to empower their customers, in particular women. With this in mind Jet together with Joe Public Connect realised the strong role they can play in body positivity and feminine health. With one in 28 South African women diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetimes the brand knew they could make a difference with a positive campaign that aims to educate and help clear the stigma that surrounds the disease.  Jet’s core target market is women aged 24–55, from lower-income households that don’t always have access to information regarding breast cancer. The campaign content gives women access to clear and easy-to-understand information that could help save their lives. Jet has also ensured that the educational content resonates with its target market by providing translations into various languages.  “We need to start talking about breast cancer on a national level and we need to start dispelling the myths about it so that women can have open, honest and more positive conversations about their breasts, the disease and life after detection and diagnosis,” Riamari Schoombee, Divisional Executive: Jet Marketing.  Jet partnered with Professor Carol Benn and Breast Health Foundation a dedicated, not-for-profit organisation that operates clinics and mobile education units around the country to provide the most accurate medical statistics and information. “One of the most challenging aspects of this campaign was realising just how much stigma surrounds breast cancer and how much work needs to be done through clear communication to make sure women can take care of their bodies. Things like you need to 'know your normal' and check your breasts every month, seven days after your period. It’s inspiring to see Jet helping to destigmatise the disease so we can start to talk openly about breasts and encourage women not to be scared but to feel hopeful because knowledge is power,” says Megan Perks, Executive Creative Director, Joe Public Connect.  This integrated campaign comes to life through in-store collateral, print, radio, digital and social media. All media leads to Breast Health Foundation’s 24-hour toll-free helpline. The campaign starts in August, Women’s Month, and will run until the end of October, Breast Cancer Awareness Month, with the creative campaign ramping up efforts during that month.  Breast Cancer Awareness is an initiative that Jet is very passionate about and will continue to support and advocate for beyond 2019. Jet’s aim is not to provide medical information but rather to use their powerful platforms to empower through access to educational information.
