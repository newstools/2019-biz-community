I spoke to some of the team members at Hero, a full-service advertising agency in Cape Town, to find out what they do outside of work that enables them to excel at it.The burlesque dancerCaron Isaacs is a senior account manager and a burlesque dancer. "Burlesque has inspired me to stay true to the course I believe in, no matter what others' perception of me might be. It’s helped me realise that there is absolute beauty in imperfection and to be completely cool with your flaws, acknowledge them, work on them, but not allow them to define you. It has taught me to celebrate and highlight that which makes you come alive. I now revel in my loudness and love that I am as subtle as a sledgehammer. Before, I was ashamed of it."<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513867-625x469.jpg" alt="When she's not working as senior account manager, Caron Isaacs is a burlesque dancer." width="625" height="469">When she's not working as senior account manager, Caron Isaacs is a burlesque dancer.One would wonder how burlesque helps fuel one's work life. Isaacs breaks it down: "Burlesque refines and hones in on my attention to detail, craftsmanship, communication without words, expression and shows me that there are many ways to skin the same cat. There is value in our differences. I use these learnings when approaching both clients and the creative process, of which client service is a vital (though often neglected) part.”The content creatorTiido Mogale is a copywriter who does more than just write copy. His scribbles include rap-lines, poetry and short stories. "Outside of Hero, I live multiple lives in that I can be a lover, activist or an observer of life and society through my collection of writings (bkt.writes).”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513868-625x469.jpg" alt="Tiido Mogale and his poetry." width="625" height="469">Tiido Mogale and his poetry.When not writing, Mogale spends time in the studio with music producer Kay Faith. “Finding time to be in the studio is a different story,” he said. “I’ve had to miss a few studio sessions because of agency life, but I’m working on finding a balance.”He says that his external passions fuel his work life because he can weave them into the work he does. “By moving from advertising to bkt.writes to working with Kay Faith, it helps keep my mind fresh, allowing me to create work that is not redundant or mediocre. Instead, my mind is continuously renewed, allowing me to constantly approach problems differently.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/501931-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Photo by LinkedIn Sales Navigator on ." width="120" height="120">#YouthMonth: Are young creatives really in it for the love of advertising?In matric, a family friend told me about this thing called 'copywriting'. Without thinking too much about it, I signed up for a course at Red and Yellow. I thought I was going to learn how to write, but instead, I was taught how to think and more so, how to sell ideas...By Tiido Mogale 14 Jun 2019The visual curator Lutho Baba is a design intern who is dedicated to the curation of ideas. He works on the clothing/fashion aspect of Parlé – a creative studio that he co-founded. His definition of passion is “something that you could spend hours doing endlessly just because you know it gives you a great amount of satisfaction – probably what people think love is.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513869-625x469.jpg" alt="Lutho Baba and his creative work." width="625" height="469">Lutho Baba and his creative work.He explains that his passion gives him a sense of purpose. That it gives him a platform to slowly and steadily work towards where he wants to be in life. “It is that feeling of living your childhood dream. The zeal I have to learn and grow is the key to my greatness.”When asked how his love for fashion fuels his day-job, he said that it exposes him to a different set of challenges and inspirations. “It improves me as a person and a creative.”The musicianKyle Harker, client service director, defines passion as “that inner drive or fire that propels a person beyond what they think they are capable of. The thing you have inside that, no matter how tired you feel or how bad your day has been, allows you to pick yourself up and give it your all.”Over the past 10 years, he has learnt to play the guitar. “I play in a worship band and the entire experience has pushed me to my limits. It's something that is part of my everyday routine – preparing for a service or conference or working on new songs.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513870-625x469.jpg" alt="Outside of work, Kyle Harker performs in a worship band." width="625" height="469">Outside of work, Kyle Harker performs in a worship band.When asked how creating music for worship helps him find internal greatness, he says, “I see internal greatness as that feeling of accomplishment or being part of something bigger that fills the void inside of you.

It gives me energy every day to handle the different pressures that come with leadership and being an executive.”Light your fireIt’s important to ensure that what nourishes your soul continues doing that.Reflect on it. Think about the things that you’ve always done that have been your happy place. Then consider trying different activities or hobbies. You may be surprised at what will give you even more joy.Be true to you. The realisation of your passion doesn’t come from people-pleasing. It comes from being you, which sometimes first requires finding yourself.Consider making a to-do list. A to-do list is very useful for making sure you make time for what’s important to you. If you don’t give the best to yourself, how can you give the best of yourself?Make your passion work for you. Maybe you’re a “they sleep, we grind” type, up before it’s even light outside. Or perhaps you’re a night owl and that’s when your creativity (and inner freak) comes out. That’s all good, nobody is judging. As long as you find a time that works for you to make your passion a priority.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511114.jpg" alt="Can the workplace actually make you healthier?" width="120" height="120">Can the workplace actually make you healthier?For many, wellbeing in the workplace means physical health: ergonomic furniture, a fitness centre and healthy choices in the cafeteria.
