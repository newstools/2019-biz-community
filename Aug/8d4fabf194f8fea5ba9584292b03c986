A way to improve the judging process, all Loeries judges will take part in the anti-bias and cultural literacy training, part of Google’s global diversity and inclusion platform, Rare. Here, Patel explains the main unconscious biases that play a role today when we interact with others, as well as the after-effect of the unconscious bias training and how this will assist the Loeries’ 2019 judges when making their decisions on which creative work to award….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are the main unconscious biases that play a role today when we interact with others? Unconscious biases are social stereotypes about social and identity groups that individuals form and hold. They can involve race/ethnicity, age, gender, sexual orientation, religion, weight, language group – any number of characteristics. Our own unconscious bias can influence our thinking and decisions as much as our rational thought processes do, which is why it is so important to be aware of them and to guard against them.They limit creative thinking and the potential to innovate, and it can influence our decisions when it comes to selecting the best work. Rare was designed with and for the creative industries to enable under-represented talent, businesses and the industry at large to drive, and benefit from, more inclusive cultures. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495863-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Katja Thielen, creative director and founder of the UK’s Together Design and this year's Loeries design jury president..." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: "Discover how different cultures are reflected through their creativity and ideas" - Katja ThielenI chatted to the international jury presidents ahead of the upcoming Loeries Creative Week.

Unconscious bias can lead judges to dismiss work they don’t identify with and disregard perspectives from judges they don’t relate to. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507153-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Lanre Adisa, CEO/CCO of Noah's Ark Communications, Nigeria, and Loeries 2019 Live, PR and OOH juror." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: "No place for one-size-fits-all in truly relatable regional storytelling" - Lanre AdisaWith the year's biggest international award shows done and dusted, I chatted to the regional jurors ahead of the upcoming Loeries Creative Week.

Talk us through the importance of unconscious bias training – what’s the after-effect? Humans tend to categorise things as a way to make sense of the overwhelming stimuli we are exposed to every day and save time and effort processing information. We categorise people too, which is often displayed in our tendency to rely on stereotypes. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/510766-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Unstereotype Alliance: The problem is not seeing the problem." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: Welcome UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance SA chapter!This Women's Day in SA, we welcomed news that the Loeries has joined forces with UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance initiative, to launch its South Africa chapter, set to use the advertising industry as a force for good to drive positive change all over the world...By Leigh Andrews 9 Aug 2019Everyone has unconscious biases – the result of unconscious bias training is that we become exposed to where our own prejudices lie and to then counter them when we’re making decisions, and especially when we’re stressed, tired or under pressure, because that’s when these biases tend to come to the fore..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}That’s the very definition of judging! What will the Loeries judges’ training then entail? The Rare Juries interactive short courses use a series of exercises and tutorials to help awards judges learn where their bias comes from, how they can identify a biased thought they’ve had, the terminology to articulate bias, and the process to de-bias a thought or action. Ultimately, it will improve the jurors’ cultural literacy, and lead them to celebrate the work that is most deserving.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497980-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Loeries2019: Google SA's head of Creative Agencies on the new YouTube category" width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: Google SA's head of Creative Agencies on the new YouTube categoryThe Loeries and YouTube recently introduced the YouTube Advertising category within Digital Communication...By Jessica Tennant 24 May 2019As a founding sponsor of Rare, Google has been instrumental to its growth since 2017, and officially adopted the platform in 2018.

How can creatives enhance theirs?Cultural literacy refers to the ability to understand different beliefs, customs, values and behaviours that are held by people who are different to them, and not behave in a way that is biased or judgemental towards them as a result of those beliefs.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/505146-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nedal Ahmed, senior copywriter at 72andSunny, Amsterdam and this year's Loeries Film and Radio jury president." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: "Celebrate creativity that touches on everyday culture" - Nedal AhmedWith the year's biggest international award shows done and dusted, I chatted to the international jury presidents ahead of the upcoming Loeries Creative Week.

Making judges aware of how they unconsciously discriminate, who they discriminate against and why and how to identify this thinking will lead them to more objectively evaluate and award the work they’re reviewing.It is our hope that in making the jury more aware of negative stereotypes and unconscious bias, we will reward work that doesn’t merely mirror society, but plays an important role in leading society.We believe it’s important that advertising and design help build a better society, and a huge part of that is breaking down stereotypes.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496774-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Tara McKenty - creative director for Google APAC and Google digital communication jury president for Loeries 2019." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: "The responsibility to use creativity and craft for social good" - Tara McKentyI chatted to the international jury presidents ahead of the upcoming Loeries Creative Week.
