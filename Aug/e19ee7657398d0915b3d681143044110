At the age of 15, I was very interested in what my mother was doing as a digital account manager. She worked from home dealing with brands and agencies, doing client service, generating revenue and hitting targets – it all seemed like it rocked! I wanted to do the cool things she was doing, so at the age of 16, I worked in retail during the school holidays and weekends; I gained an enormous amount of face-to-face client service experience and confidence to deal with clients. After I matriculated I studied online marketing, and when I turned 20, I started my path in my first digital position as an advertising campaign manager.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1802/428000-120x120.jpg" alt="Pete Case, chief creative officer, Ogilvy &amp; Mather South Africa." width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2018: The transformation of the advertising spaceThe reality of effectively marketing through the line, has for many years been an incredibly complex discussion. Our industry is constantly adapting to the changing needs of the consumer landscape and there are huge pressures that everyone is feeling on both agency and client side to deliver...By Pete Case 5 Feb 2018I always had the desire to grow from working for a boss to owning a digital publishing company, yet still working with brands and agencies. Five years later I started thinking and planning for this company, until three years ago when I met a brilliant brain in the industry, who had the same brain farts as me. Two brains are always better than one, they say, so we went on and connected the two brains by connecting the two business ideas and so we became Digital Driven (DD).We created more revenue for publishers by delivering more value to advertisers. We develop and implement solutions guaranteed to increase spend on our publisher partner sites.Over the years, I’ve grown from managing direct ads and doing website designs to getting into social media and programmatic yield management and developing business marketing strategies. I’ve also implemented the setting up of huge corporate publishers’ website networks. I am strategically building publisher partnerships to form one enormous African network.4.
