Therefore, you have to pick that one particular brand and focus your energy into making it the biggest asset of your arsenal. Similarly, in a group of troops, there’s always a commander. Like the earliest example made of the orchestra, there’s always a conductor who controls the entire performance.Retain existing customers and attract (the right) new customersAs previously mentioned, brand management is driven by a specific objective(s) that’s what is important to always remember when implementing any brand activation effort. You always want to retain the existing customer by keeping them informed about your endeavours – just excite them to continue their loyalty to the brand, however, acquiring new customers is also part of the equation.All of this boils down to leveraging insight from a research report for all brand management efforts to be profitable or achieve the objective(s). Brand and marketing managers have to be goal-directed.All marketing is aimed at retaining and gaining customers, therefore brands are the conduits used to achieve this objective. This means that all marketing activities must always be traced back to whether they achieved these objectives.Brand and marketing management activities must be systematic and accountable based on proper analysis. It is imperative to always audit to know which factors/elements build or detract from the value of the brand.
