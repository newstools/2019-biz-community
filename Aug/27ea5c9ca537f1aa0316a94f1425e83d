Jeremy is making Byron’s donation worth his while by adding tights and suspenders to his wardrobe for this photoshoot. August is also Mansfield’s birthday so Jeremy, in the spirit of community, has decided to do “just about” anything you wish him to do, for a donation of R10,000 to the Hot 91.9FM charity arm Hot Cares. Sam Cowen says, “The Mansfield in the Morning team have taken the concept of the 12 Labours of Hercules, however as Jeremy is now at the ripe old age of 56, we decided that he only needs to complete 10 tasks by the end of August to raise a total of R100,000 for our community”.Would you like to get Jeremy to do absolutely anything your heart desires?
