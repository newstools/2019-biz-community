Instead, his talk focused on the creative power of relocation. Bordé quoted great actor and creative mind John Cleese, who spoke of sparking creativity through contrasting views of the world.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513233.jpg" alt="#Loeries2019: Being different is your superpower" width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: Being different is your superpowerTara McKenty, creative director at Google APAC in Sydney and Loeries digital communication jury president for 2019, was the second speaker at the Dstv Seminar of Creativity at Loeries 2019...By Angie White 1 day agoThis makes perfect sense to Bordé now that he lives in Dubai.Incorrect perceptions: Dubai lifeHis decision to move wasn't as easy as packing up his life and taking a long flight. When he first told his mom he'd be moving to Dubai, her first question was 'Where is that?' When he responded that it’s in the Middle East, her reaction was one of shock as her perception of this region was a compilation from Hollywood and war stereotypes.

Dubai is actually a safe, honest space, but you can go to jail for showing the middle finger there.Other idiosyncracies include the fact that only 15% of the population there is true Emirati, with 85% expats. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513283.jpg" alt="One of Bordé's more amusing slides, on stage at the DStv Seminar of Creativity, part of #Loeries2019.

Image via Al Nicoll © via Gallo Images.In Dubai's creative agencies, this figure is actually closer to 100% expats. Speaking of the context of advertising in Dubai, he shared that many brands are constantly on edge as the area went through an economic recession in 2009 and there are fears of a second crisis, so they're very careful with their budget.So, being a creative in Dubai usually means working with global talent on regional work.Working on insights from elsewhere in the worldBordé shared four award-winning examples of this, with key outtakes on each...1. Some of the most awarded work from the region shows the importance of gaining local insights from new imports. When the news first broke that Saudi Arabian women would finally be legally allowed to drive, many brands jumped on board with special promotions, but it took the expats from elsewhere to realise that what these new female drivers would most enjoy is the support of their male relatives, as seen in TBWA\RAAD's Nissan #SheDrives campaign:2. Another example of expats tapping into ideas with the power to innovate locally relates to a novel way of measuring SUV performance in the region that was culturally spot-on - TBWA\RAAD's Nissan's #CamelPower: <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1709/410006-120x120.png?2" alt="Desert camelpower in action!" width="120" height="120">#Loeries2017: Stoked about camelpowerFitting for #InnovationMonth, I chatted to Charbel Aouad, executive producer and cofounder at Dubai's Stoked, the production company behind an integrated campaign Loeries Gold and this year's integrated Grand Prix for turning horsepower into camelpower...By Leigh Andrews 8 Sep 20173. Bordé's examples also touched on generational insights. For example, it was found that millennials would rather look at their phones than buy lottery tickets. Solution? Bring the lotto fun to the mobile phone, with some selfie action for Lotto Libanais' 'Lucky Face' campaign:4. Your greatest inspiration could also come from a daily frustration, like a boring stretch of highway. Why not turn that into an immersive art show? That's where 'Louvre Abu Dhabi's 'Highway Gallery' flourished...Tying these examples back to his theme of relocation’s effect on creativity, Bordé tried to prove why you become more creative when you immerse yourself in other markets. He consulted with others who had relocated and found the following four things:Why your creativity soars when working in other markets1. There's often pressure from home to perform.2. From the moment you receive the brief, to the brainstorm process to producing the creative work, you're working with different cultures. It's a great daily clash that challenges your thinking and makes the mind more flexible.3. There's a strong sense of 'passerby syndrome' in Dubai, as it's seen as a temporary location, a stage from which to jump into another market so there are lots of other cultures to rub off on.4. There's also a strong sense of hunger, as the relocation is usually seen as an opportunity to shine with a better salary and way of life, while doing the type of work you like to do.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/494893-120x120.png?2" alt="Loeries CEO Andrew Human encourages everyone to tell better stories." width="120" height="120">#AfricaMonth: Advertising's shift beyond 'selling stuff' to tell better regional storiesIn our annual #AfricaMonth catch-up, Loeries CEO Andrew Human explains why Loeries 2019 judges are briefed to look for local relevance, and the rising importance of brand humanity and problem-solving in creativity, against the continued shift away from merely punting the client product or service...By Leigh Andrews 3 May 2019To apply this sense of relocation-enhanced creativity, Bordé says you can move to another market, or flip this on its head by bringing in new talent from elsewhere locally, while boosting your internal talent team with fresh perspectives and different insights.He ended with another of Cleese's quotes, this time on how we better understand what we like when we move away from home and miss it as it's no longer within reach.
