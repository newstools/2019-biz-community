What they fail to mention is that traditional media such as TV, outdoor and print are far more effective than digital media in creating brand credibility. Most traditional media has the unique ability to graphically show and creatively shout out just how strong the relevant brand is.Traditional Marketing VS Digital Marketing #DigitalMarketing #socialmediamarketing pic.twitter.com/YXapSzkXZY— martin mulwa (@lentoxkenya) July 28, 2019There’s a basic rationale here.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/504142-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The secret of radio's success: its old strengths remain, but it evolves with the times" width="120" height="120">The secret of radio's success: its old strengths remain, but it evolves with the timesNow that we live in a world of Netflix, Spotify and smartphones, people often ask why radio still has such strong staying power as a mass medium and as a channel for advertising...By wayne bischoff 27 Jun 2019Even though the internet can be a scary place, any person who has just a modicum of digital skills is capable of posting an ad on Facebook or Gumtree. On the other hand, it is also fair to say that it is only those brands with a bit of substance and plenty of means who occupy media such as billboards, print or television.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/505432-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Internet advertising set to account for more than 50% of global adspend by 2021" width="120" height="120">Internet advertising set to account for more than 50% of global adspend by 2021Internet advertising is set to exceed half of global adspend by 2021, although, as the internet ad market matures, growth is projected to slow from 17% to 9% a year...8 Jul 2019Before the Righteous Fundamentalists get ahead of themselves, there’s a simple fact that they have to accept: In most cases, when done correctly, a digital marketing campaign will deliver optimal returns on marketing investment. I say this with absolute confidence, not least of all because traditional media is incapable of providing accurate numbers when it comes to calculating a return on investment.There is a lot more detail one could go into but it’s pretty obvious that the most effective way one should approach the conundrum of digital versus traditional is to embrace the glory of the ‘and’ do both, budget notwithstanding. I say this, not because I think it but, because I know it from practical experience.The case for amplificationIn an attempt to measure the effectiveness of a true “omnichannel” marketing approach, my team and I partnered with a Johannesburg-based advertising agency. The basic objective of the exercise was to ascertain what “lift” or amplification a digital campaign could exert on entries to an existing competition running across a selection of traditional media channels for and on behalf of a well-known safety footwear brand.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507453-120x120.jpg?2" alt="85% of global consumers want omnichannel experiences - finds CMO Council study" width="120" height="120">85% of global consumers want omnichannel experiences - finds CMO Council studyMore than 85% of the 2,000 global consumers surveyed prefer personal, trusted and reliable omnichannel engagement...25 Jul 2019The basic concept of the campaign was to drive entries via specific USSD (unstructured supplementary service data) strings linked to the different media channels, which included out-of-home billboards, transit TV, community radio, national newspapers and a selection of popular magazine titles.We used the USSD method instead of an SMS call-to-action so that we could accurately report on the number of entries per province and limit the risk of duplicate entries by allowing each mobile phone number to only enter the competition once. ExecutionAfter an initial period of six weeks using only traditional channels, we deployed two different digital campaigns on Facebook, specifically targeting consumers who were most likely to see a single out-of-home billboard in Johannesburg and another in Cape Town.Although the digital message and creative look was the same as the traditional advertisements, the digital campaign had the added advantage of allowing users to submit competition entries via a website instead of USSD.  Amplification results:The following results are exclusively for USSD competition entries and exclude entries generated from online entry forms.The digital campaign targeting users likely to see the Cape Town billboard increased the weekly USSD entries by 91%.The digital campaign targeting users likely to see the Johannesburg billboard increased the weekly USSD entries by 73%.It’s important to note that the average percentage of USSD entries per week for the non-amplified billboard in other provinces stayed the same or dropped. The idea that digital marketing makes out-of-home and other traditional media channels irrelevant is simply nonsense – improved campaign performance results are achieved when digital is used to amplify these channels. It is the job of digital to reinforce the traditional media messages and it does this incredibly well, allowing users to interact with a brand at a time and place that’s convenient for them to do so.Digital provides intimacy whilst traditional media provides brand credibility.There is a caveat, however.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/504316.png" alt="Digital agency no longer a luxury but a necessity" width="120" height="120">Digital agency no longer a luxury but a necessityOur world has digitised.

Failure to do this will give you skewed results.All the statistics point to the fact that the most successful marketers of the future will be those who embrace the glory of the “and” by delivering messages across all marketing channels in an integrated approach.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/505955-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Digital marketing in a third world country" width="120" height="120">Digital marketing in a third world countryAs a third world country, traditional media is our main method of communication with radio, television and OOH the highest consumed mediums across various markets in South Africa.
