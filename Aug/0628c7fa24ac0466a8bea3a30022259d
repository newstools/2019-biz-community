His talk ‘AKA on Urban Culture: How brands can fit in and stand out’ will explore the significance of meaningful brand partnerships and “the creative ways in which brands can seamlessly fit themselves into urban culture,” says AKA. “It’s such an honour to speak to my peers on this level and continue the conversation on music and brand partnerships that make sense.”The ‘Fela In Versace’ singer is a brand unto himself. His high-profile brand endorsements, from Cruz Vodka, to Vodacom, and being the first African ambassador for Reebok Classic have added to both his success and those of the brands he works with. AKA took the creative lead on the distinctive look and feel of the Cruz Watermelon Vodka packaging, and PJ Morilly, Brand Director of Reebok South Africa told e-retailer Zando that “there is a shared ambition of excellence between AKA and us to always be acutely relevant and produce stuff that surprises and delights fans and followers. AKA personifies confidence, style and performance.”“Consumers are in the driving seat when it comes to brand success,” says Loeries CEO Andrew Human. “AKA’s leading ideas and his music have made him a brand icon. It will be great to have him share those insights at the Loeries.”The DStv Seminar of Creativity is part of Loeries Creative Week, which takes place from 22 to 25 August.
