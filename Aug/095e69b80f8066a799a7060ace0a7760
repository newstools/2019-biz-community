The world and South Africa are becoming more health-conscious, and we are becoming more aware of what impacts our environment negatively. I think we as South Africans are more invested in our health and well-being as a whole, as we generally just want to feel better..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Considering that South Africa (and Africa in general) is quite a meat-loving region, how does Infinite Foods plan to grow market share here?  It all starts with great taste! We aim to be the global category leader in each plant-based alternative category. We are driven to find the best plant alternatives that taste and satisfies like the real thing. One of our key products, the Beyond Burger, tastes, cooks and satisfies like a real beef burger.
