Creating value for customers and assisting in volume retention was also key, as well as generating excitement around the brand, while retaining appeal to Toyota Hilux customers.“The longest active model range in South Africa, that’s 50 years and 47 of them as market leader with over one million units sold to date, Toyota South Africa Motors first created a bespoke limited-edition model aptly named Legend 35 in 2004 as a tribute to its success and rich heritage,” she said.“This was followed by the Legend 40 and Legend 45 in 2009 and 2014 respectively. With the calendar rolling over to 2019, the time for a new Legend arrived, to celebrate 50 years of local Hilux. “But we wanted the new limited-edition model to do more than that. It has to work hard for us to drive purchase consideration, maintain high Hilux sales volumes and further entrench the ‘Legend’ sub-brand by driving awareness of the Hilux Legend 50 vehicle,” said Dlamini.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/510810.png" alt="Toyota Hilux turns 50, celebrates with everyday legends in new campaign from FCB Joburg" width="310" height="500" rel="">click to enlarge<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/510812.png" alt="Toyota Hilux turns 50, celebrates with everyday legends in new campaign from FCB Joburg" width="310" height="500" rel="">click to enlargeFor the agency, it was vital that the campaign did not get stuck in the quagmire of nostalgia and showcase bygone generations; it wanted to focus on what makes the Toyota Hilux itself a legend.“For us, the legendary toughness of Hilux lives in the hands-on experiences of those who drive it — ‘people who do’,” said Executive Business Director, Reagen Kok.“Toyota has always built incredibly tough bakkies, but they’ve become legendary bakkies because of what people have done with them. At a key milestone in the legacy of Hilux, it only seemed appropriate to acknowledge the driver as part of this vehicle’s legendary success.”This sentiment is expressed not only in the campaign’s pay-off line – ‘The Hilux wasn’t born a legend; it was made one by you’ – but it also features across TVC and the cinema 40-second and 30-second executions, and filters through to all mediums. For example, radio: ‘If after herding cattle all day you still herd the kids to the bath (Legend!)/If you do the ice run in the middle of a braai (What a legend!)/If the only thing hard about the job is your hat (You Legend!)/If your Hilux’s second coat of paint is mud (Legend! Legend!)’“Importantly, Legend 50 is an opportunity to include the driver in the legendary success of Toyota Hilux.Aspirational as ever, we don’t just want people to think, ‘That’s a nice bakkie — I want it’. We want them to feel proud and confident. We want them to connect with our comms, evoking the feeling that: ‘That’s my bakkie. It’s a ‘Legend’ for what it is capable of doing and I’m part of that ‘Legend’ of doing too!” added Van den Heever.The TVC was shot by Star Films over two days in Johannesburg.Credits:Client: Toyota SABrand: Hilux Legend 50 Vice President – Marketing: Glenn CromptonGeneral Manager – Marketing: Lettie LabuschagneSenior Manager – Advertising & Digital Marketing: Tasneem LorgatGeneral Manager – Advertising: Lensha Dlamini Creative Agency: FCB Joburg Executive Business Director: Reagen KokAccount Lead: Taryn Marais Account Director and Project Manager: Christine LubbeExecutive Creative Director: Brett MorrisCreative Director: Tian van den HeeverStrategic Planner: Stuart Sims Media Planners: Gwen Bezuidenhout, Thulani Nombewu and Langelihle SitholeArt Director: Jonathan WolbergCopywriter: Paul FradeDigital Content Lead: Lucy Holford-Walker TV Production: Nakita BolusProduction Companies: Star FilmsDirector: PH 2.0 - Jonathan Parkinson & Matsepo MajaProduction House Producer: Vanessa BorthwickLanguage/s: English and Afrikaans Post Production Facility: Offline (Strange Love), Online (Ludus Michale Naidoo) Post house Fuel Editor: Xander VanderSound Engineer:  Sean WilliamsMusic Publisher: Higher Fight Music Producer/Composer: Garth Barens Audio Facility: Sterling Sound Voice Over/s: Mbeu Kambuwa English and Anton Schmidt Afrikaans
