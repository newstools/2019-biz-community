The students were also awarded an all-expenses-paid trip to Loeries Creative Week in Durban.Another group of students from the Durban campus – Amy Tjasink, Justine Clyde and Roxanne Schoon – were awarded a gold Loerie for their submission, ‘FEM’, a digital publication looking at the concept of feminism through the eyes of women. A silver Loerie was awarded to Lebohang Machitje and Bathabile Xaba for ‘Hopeful Foods’, an idea that would help alleviate the dietary challenges commonly faced by cancer patients. Kyle Gounden and Christian Botha also received a silver Loerie for their ‘Rita Devu Drives Like You’ initiative that aims to teach the importance of safe driving to ‘tomorrow’s drivers’. Last but certainly not least, a bronze Loerie was awarded to Vini Xavier, Micah Bwanali and Julie Dancaster for their campaign entitled ‘Adidas Beats’, which was dedicated to helping women athletes drown out the negative comments often aimed at them by society.“Some of the work we saw streaming in from IIE Vega students and others was arguably on par with that of seasoned industry experts. We are immensely proud of every single one of the Veganites who took part and who were recognised on such a prestigious platform – well done to everyone!” says Lurie.
