Stories of women who are emergency workers, farmers, bankers, engineers or single mothers.According to Stats SA in 2017, young women in South Africa make up a massive 50% of the population. There are thus three stereotypes that brands would be wise to steer clear of, to be inclusive and possibly reach a whole new audience:They are:All women are mothersAll women are married (or should be)All women love cooking and cleaningAll women are mothers.Not all women are mothers. And some can’t or don’t want to be. Studies show that millennials are having children later or not at all, yet it appears Generation Z will have even less. And that should be okay. Infertility, careers, societal pressure, cost of living and the lure of single life all impact on when and if women have children.Infertility alone affects more than 48 million couples in the world. In South Africa, 20% of couples are unable to have children – enough so that some are calling for it to be classed as a disability.Brands have this incredible opportunity to reach women without alienating a significant part of their audience. To go on a journey with women not only as mothers but as leaders; mentors; spiritual mothers; sisters; aunts and teachers.“All women are married.”A Tinder survey of singles aged 18 to 25, revealed that 80% felt that staying single was better for work, friendship, fitness and to gain unique experiences. Already in 2014, about 50.2 % of American adults were single.A growing number of men and women also choose single parenting for various reasons.

Women are no longer following the path of their mothers and grandmothers and feeling pressurised to get married.Consider that sometimes the person using your washing powder is a father who has his kids for the weekend. Other times it may be a successful single mom’s helper or mother.

If we are honest – many women in South Africa are cleaning homes that are not their own. If we take washing powder, for example, this puts a new spin on the disparity between “target market”, their “buying power” and whether they actually affect the purchase decision.There are women who get home at 6pm and 7pm and then have homework, tests, projects and speeches. Tell them about quick, healthy meals they can serve their family – without the guilt.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/487501-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FutureFit Yourself: Why diversity inclusion requires a restoration strategy" width="120" height="120">#FutureFit Yourself:  Why diversity inclusion requires a restoration strategyCarmen Murray lists simple starting points for businesses to start the process of restoration...By Carmen Murray 14 Mar 2019Give them a product that cleans today’s sports kit in time for the next morning. In fact, tell them about the material their son’s school shirt is made of and how it won’t need ironing if you hang it up tonight to be dry for tomorrow.Women make up nearly 85% of the consumer market. We cannot afford to ignore even a small percentage of them. If we do and if we only focus on them during Women’s Month, we will lose out on market share, brand loyalty, credibility, trust and ultimately, profits.
