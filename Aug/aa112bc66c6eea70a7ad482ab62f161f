But let’s switch from the sense of taste to sound…City Sightseeing, by soundTastebuds tickled, we plugged in the City Sightseeing bus’ signature red-and-yellow earbuds to learn along the route, and fittingly, one of the first snippets was about measures taken to combat the water shortage in the Cape.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490248-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Screen grabs from the SodaStreamMe and Pick n Pay TasteTech videos." width="120" height="120">Sign of the future? The creativity of April Fool's Day pranking in the retail industryApril Fool's Day has come and gone, but we should nurture the creativity involved in putting together some of the more elaborate ideas. Here's a round-up of some of the best retail industry April Fool's Day pranks we've seen this time around, and why we shouldn't rule out seeing similar innovation for real in the future...By Leigh Andrews 2 Apr 2019Arriving at the V&A Waterfront’s Clock Tower stop, we also learned about the language nuances of the city and how Devil’s Peak is linked to the tale of Van Hunks. Entering the Foreshore area with its tall skyscrapers was also all the more impressive when we heard that the whole area was under the sea until 1947.This is a wonderful way to learn about your city – even as a local. We heard that “With Table Mountain always in sight, it can be said Capetonians never get lost as they navigate by it. They also hear a boom and feel the earth move under your feet with the roar of the Noon Day Gun’s cannon each day except Sunday.By then we’d reached the top of Signal Hill, where the weather playing just long enough for us to snap a few photos before the heavens opened.
