This inner struggle reminded us of the tension we face daily by having to choose between the good and bad parts of ourselves. The name Saint is associated with the good and righteous, but looked at more closely the word Saint contains ‘sin’. We built an entire identity off this platform while suggesting that the struggle between saint and sinner, should not be a struggle at all, but celebrated as two necessary aspects of ourselves. Visually we have done this in three ways:  Traditional paintings are infused with subversive subject matter.  Overt defacement of imagery with graffiti.  Subtle symbolism in imagery. The work has been a resounding success with the restaurant becoming one of the most talked about and visited venues in SA.
