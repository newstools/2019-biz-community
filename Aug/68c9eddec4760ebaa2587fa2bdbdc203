Almost half of the strategists surveyed are doing more work on CX for clients this year and, for a quarter, work for direct-to-to-consumer (DTC) brands have increased.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/512234.jpg" alt="Automation of CX is the only way to grow your business" width="120" height="120">Automation of CX is the only way to grow your businessDoing more with less. Working in an agile way. These phrases are typically mentioned when describing essential components of doing business in the digital age...By Kevin South 21 Aug 2019Respondents see this as an exciting opportunity as the strategist role and craft skills evolve to shape brand experiences and brand truths. Tom Morton, US Chief Strategy Officer, R/GA, says: "If experience is the new high ground for brands, experience strategists are the new brand guardians."Strategists are in high demand The growth in CX is driving demand for the strategic services of consultancies, which have used their tech and data heritage to position themselves as experience experts. One outcome of increased competition is that strategists are becoming untethered from their traditional place within agencies, with more career options to choose from.Whilst 40% of strategists surveyed say their team has grown over the past year, 63% do not think their next role will be with an agency.Agencies undervalue strategy The movement of strategists away from agencies may be exacerbated by the perception that strategy is being undervalued in agencies. Though most believe their influence is growing internally, selling the value of strategic services to clients is a challenge in an environment of budget cuts and a lack of understanding around the role.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1808/454236-120x120.jpg?2" alt="A conversation about strategy, ad agencies and the role of strategists inside ad agencies" width="120" height="120">A conversation about strategy, ad agencies and the role of strategists inside ad agenciesIt all started with a post on LinkedIn where I was sharing my opinion on the role of strategy in ad agencies, and a conversation between myself and Gidon Orelowitz ensued...By Bogosi Motshegwa 22 Aug 2018Strategists see their value in working on upstream business problems and drawing insights from data. However, the reality is that they spend their time juggling both upstream and downstream work.Andreas Krasser, CEO of DDB Group Hong Kong, commenting on the value of strategy in Asia says: "Short-term-orientated planning approaches and an overtly executional focus in many of the region's marketing communities make it difficult for strategists to prove their worth."Data + ‘real-life’ = creativityStrategists were almost unanimous (92%) in the feeling that they would do a better job if they had more access to client data. In the age of 'big data', the disciplines of strategy and analytics are increasingly merging as strategists are being asked to make use of the wealth of first-party data that brands now own.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513471.jpg" alt="The evolving data management plan" width="120" height="120">The evolving data management planGiven the importance of data in today's connected business environment, organisations have no choice but to embrace a more effective data management plan...2 hours agoHowever, data alone will lead to predictable, unexciting advertising. Strategists need to retain the link to 'real-life' and use their understanding of consumers and culture to drive creativity.

But in the context of creativity, data is useless without imagination."COMING SOON: Want to know what Neil Godber from @WunThompson and other experts think about the future of #strategy?
