It’s far bigger than just one fabulously-wealthy expat family or a single head of state.Nasty, self-driven rotState capture is a nasty, self-driven rot that sets in. As we have seen during the current hearings of the Judicial Commission of Inquiry into Allegations of State Capture, Corruption and Fraud in the Public Sector, state capture very much begins and ends with the individual.The endless procession of selfish rogues the law-abiding public has had to endure clearly-illustrates that this threat to our democracy is not driven by faceless organisations but by very visible individuals who just couldn’t give a damn.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506476-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Former South African President Jacob Zuma.

When it comes to the former, in particular, we’ve seen several venerable publishing houses overwhelmed by partisan interests with catastrophic outcomes. The resultant output is so bad, these titles are forced to survive on the proceeds of legal notices, government advertorials and similarly sad quasi-advertising efforts.Lesson one in avoiding personal capture is straight out of a mafia movie. Never accept gifts. Once you accept that first gift, they’ve got you. Seriously, consult your organisation’s gifting policy for the proper etiquette when it comes to colleagues and clients giving you birthday, anniversary and other presents. If your employer doesn't have a gifting policy in place, be proactive and offer to draft one.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511174-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Elijah O'Donnell on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Sanef's media credibility and ethics inquiry looks to review editorial systems, practicesSince its launch in June, the South African National Editors' Forum's (Sanef) Inquiry into Media Credibility and Ethics has received submissions from journalists and members of the public...13 Aug 2019You might consider developing a relationship with a respected business leader or community activist, for example, to help keep you on the right path. Not everything in our industry is black and white and having a mentor might help you navigate the shades of grey that are sure to pop up during any media and marketing career.Most media and marketing firms today publish a lot of information on their websites around their values, mission statement and so on. Joining a like-minded set of colleagues similarly-committed to a bight South African future will help a lot when it comes to avoiding the quagmire of personal and organisational capture.Related to the above, you can help keep your organisation free from the murky world of bribes and kickbacks by helping to arrange the kind of guest speakers that would inject a breath of fresh air and transparency into the organisation.Someone from a local charity, business association or community initiative could remind all concerned that rejecting corruption is the only way to secure a good future for our children, friends and family.
