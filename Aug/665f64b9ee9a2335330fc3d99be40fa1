Their ability to offer refreshing, unique and unencumbered client experiences are helping them land some big fish.It is often the top creative talent and visionaries who birth small agencies after a successful career at a big agency.

Of course, I’m not talking about a complete 180° deviation on the concept.Sometimes business owners and CMOs change their mind halfway through a campaign and expect the agency to make changes without costing for a completely new concept.When there are changes to tweak a concept or update a campaign with new market information, smaller agencies don’t have to jump through as many hoops.Another benefit is that the person on the other end of the line (or email) is most likely the one who will execute your changes which makes for a faster approach.More bang for your marketing buckI’m not talking about cheap. Smaller agencies are not necessarily cheap. But their costing is, at times, more transparent and straightforward and they don’t have to carry the extra cost of massive building leases, staff contingent, utilities, departments that have nothing to do with your project.

The same goes for meetings which can be huge time-wasters in big agencies.There is no B teamIf your project is not one of the highest-paying, big agencies may assign it to the ‘B team’.With a small agency, there is no backup. You get the same quality as any other high-paying client.Less red tape, more relationshipI’ve already referenced the tricky and elaborate costing modules of big agencies.
