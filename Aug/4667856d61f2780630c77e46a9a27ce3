What has the experience been like so far? It has been absolutely out of this world! I have had the privilege of working more closely with our clients, media partners and the business. The experience, so far, has broadened my understanding of what clients really need from their agencies today and I am thrilled to be able to work with an amazing team to deliver this value. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}With that in mind, what are you most excited about?I am excited to explore my own personal strength by being consistent, collaborative and measurable as a great leader and a colleague to everyone that I interact with..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Take us through some of the career highlights that you’re particularly proud of.I have had an amazing journey with all the companies that I worked with and I am grateful for that. There are a few things that stand out for me and that makes me who I am today. I have never allowed titles or designations to dictate how or what I worked on, but rather passion and commitment to deliver outcomes. As such, being in the research, data and the insights space, I wanted to use reality and not surveys to make decisions. On one occasion, this took me to the streets of Ghana where I walked with the people living there, sat with them and experienced their lives. I walked away with the ability to make decisions based on real-life and at the same time, I felt so humbled to be a woman of colour in Africa..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}List a few of challenges and opportunities for women (in your industry) that you’ve personally faced in your career. For me it has been two-fold, being a woman and a woman of colour. During my career, our industry has gone from not giving women and women of colour the leadership positions they deserved to today having a fair representation of diverse female leaders. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1807/448283.png" alt="Diversity matters... and four other learnings from the 2018 Cannes Lions Festival" width="120" height="120">Diversity matters... and four other learnings from the 2018 Cannes Lions FestivalAs the dust settles on the 65th Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity, it's time to reflect on the key trends and learnings that emerged from adland's biggest annual gathering...Issued by MediaCom 10 Jul 2018The challenge for women of all races and walks of life in South Africa is to rise up and own who they are and what they can do because we come from such a complex past.
