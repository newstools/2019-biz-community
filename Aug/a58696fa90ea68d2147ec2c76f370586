Adding that at both a global and South Africa specific level, the rate of change was ensuring that the industry has found itself in a constant level of flux.Apart from industry-specific reasons, Barty added that this has been exacerbated by a reduction in business confidence brought about by socio-political instability over the past year.Before discussing key ACA activity over the year, Barty commended Mathe Okaba – appointed CEO during the period – for how she has settled into the role and for embracing the structures and practices of the association, thus ensuring a smooth and effective transition of this critical industry-leading position.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506749-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Okaba captions this: “Let it flow.”" width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with...

Mike Gendel was singled out for his contribution in representing the best interests of the profession in the establishment of the new body and for the commitment he continues to demonstrate in the pivotal area of industry self-regulation.Transformation remains key In terms of transformation, Barty noted that the topic remains a key area for the ACA – both within the organisation and externally.“Transformation remains at the forefront of the ACA’s activities, and it is pleasing that we are making continued headway in this area. I am very pleased that today the profession’s employee base stands at 60% female and 54% ‘of colour’. There are challenges that we still need to overcome, however, I encourage the next generation of industry leaders to become active within its structures and help drive not only transformation forward, but all the objectives of the association.”
