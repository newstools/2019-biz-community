How was your passion born?Three years ago, Coco Chanel magically knocked on the door of my life with  her life story. I started thinking about her personality and about ways to influence the future and decided that she was first of all a woman entrepreneur. Then I thought broader to understand ways of how to influence the future and to create our unique concept of six ways: Entrepreneur, Professional, Mother, Muse, Creator, Citizen. Then I met hundreds of great women who were inspired by this philosophy and it made this passion event stronger!3. What makes South Africa unique?What opportunities in your program, in South Africa in particular, do you envision for yourself and other entrepreneurs like yourself?I am in love with SA, because of its people first of all. South Africans are self-sufficient and positive. They are open and respectful to new trends and ideas. When I first met South African women, I felt that unique balance between being strong and being spiritual, being hard and soft is one moment. My new sisters are able to combine entrepreneurship and soul development. This is really unique.4. Do you think your program is important, for you, for the economy and sustainable development? Why?Being an entrepreneur, we can assume you find it important to some extent, how high a priority is it to foster an illustration spirit in your personal life and in their economy? Substantiate.There is a lot of research and examples that women make more sustainable and strategic development then men. Sometimes it is crucial, especially for large companies. This is the main reason why Executive Boards of the biggest companies include more and more women. A woman’s way of thinking and decision making is a great driver in development.5. What do you think has to take place to transform South Africa into “the best innovation capital in the world?”As I have already mentioned, your unique equity is people. Show to the world your innovators, tell their stories, inspire and engage.6. What makes the work you do worthwhile? What sphere of your industry gives you a reason to stay in the industry?NA7. What about the ‘hot topic’ of transformation? Do you think this is realistic, with the aim of building a more inclusive and best place for all?Yes, I believe in diversity as a resource of development and inclusivity as a great step forward for global ethics. D&I power should drive personal, corporate and national transformations for a better future.8. The marketing industry has changed drastically over the past few years with the influence and evolution of social media. Do you think the South African industry’s marketing strategies has been able to keep up to speed with these changes? What social media marketing strategies have you adopted that people in your circle of influence wouldn’t have been able to utilise five years ago?I don’t think I am an expert in SM transformation in SA. What I see here as a point of difference with the USA and Russia, that you are more traditional, you still work on longrids and publish great content. Columnists here are still very highly qualified and responsible professionals. The difference with Europe I see is that you integrate digital in your main businesses. Europe, except UK is still very much into traditional marketing.9. Cats or dogs? (Why?)Dogs. Because they share their love.10. Although challenges often feel like the straw that will break the camel's back, what are your biggest challenges since the establishment of your talent and are there any lessons you have been able to draw from them?The biggest challenge was to become a Leader for an international community, to develop within my personality this potential, this power. It pushed great transformation within me. The lesson, I would like to share is: “Overcoming your limitations is the only way to do big things.”11. How has working with other entrepreneurs impacted your life and added onto your skills?I think that entrepreneurship is a unique practice of personal development. It may even be a stage of personal development for each person. Lessons of responsibility, taking risks, thinking big and being ready for slow progress are invaluable.12. What does women's empowerment mean to you?It means empowering women to find their way to influence the future.Name of contact person Yanina DubeykovskayaE-mail Address	yana@forumdavos.combRev('brev-64b5ab69-a8e3-4322-82f6-0a798ac25f25', '>a/\<moc.sovadmurof@anay>"moc.sovadmurof;46#&anay:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<')Official Web Addresswww.womeninfluence.club
