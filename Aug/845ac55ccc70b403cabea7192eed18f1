Additionally, security and prison services company Bosasa made allegations – at the Zondo Commission – that they had paid journalists to cover the company in a positive light.While Sanef welcomed the apologies made by the Sunday Times, it felt that this was just the first step in rebuilding and regaining the public trust. It stated that it saw this as a moment for the newspaper – and all media houses – to seriously introspect and review editorial systems and practices to enhance media ethics and credibility.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/510980-120x120.gif?2" alt="Newspapers ABC Q2 2019: Newspapers' declining circulation trend continues" width="120" height="120">Newspapers ABC Q2 2019: Newspapers' declining circulation trend continuesFollowing the trend set in the Audit Bureau of Circulations of South Africa (ABC) Q1 2019 total newspaper circulation in Q2 2019 declined by 1.4% on the previous quarter and by 6.9% on the prior year...By Danette Breitenbach 13 hours agoSanef believes the inquiry is taking place against a broader backdrop of state capture in South Africa, with the media industry not being immune from being drawn into manipulative practices and collusions.STATEMENT OF THE THABO MBEKI FOUNDATION ON SANEF’S INQUIRY INTO MEDIA ETHICS. pic.twitter.com/GN7UvoUAE5— Thabo Mbeki Foundation (@TMFoundation_) June 27, 2019The terms of reference for the inquiry were crafted to include: An investigation into ethical breaches on the part of the media industry in South Africa including obstacles to accountable and credible media practice in a democratic environmentFor the panel to consider the occasion, nature, identity, reasons and impetus of such breaches as well as solutions to the current problems confronting professional and ethical journalist practiceFor the panelists to investigate the content and implementation of various editorial codes in South Africa and internationally in contributing to professional and ethical journalistic practiceFor the panel to consult with media companies and owners, political parties, government (at all levels), civil society, editors and journalists and members of the publicSanef is encouraging all interested organisations and individuals to express their views through written submissions to the panel at panel@mediainquiry.co.zabRev('brev-18614e0a-3372-49bd-83c2-858294fbdf92', '>a/\<az.oc.yriuqniaidem@lenap>"az.oc.yriuqniaidem;46#&lenap:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
