This means that judges have to understand that they are not necessarily the target audience, and to remove their own prejudices from the process,” says Andrew Human, CEO of the Loeries. “A good judge can recognise great ideas from anywhere in the world and intended for any audience – and it’s our aim to improve the judging process.” “Our own unconscious bias can limit creative thinking and the potential to innovate, and it can influence our decisions when it comes to selecting the best work,” explains Asha Ranchhod Patel, Head of Marketing at Google South Africa. All Loeries judges will take part in an anti-bias and cultural literacy training module called Rare Juries, which is part of Google’s global diversity and inclusion platform, Rare. “Rare was designed with and for the creative industries to enable under-represented talent, businesses and the industry at large to drive, and benefit from, more inclusive cultures,” says Ranchhod Patel. “Homogeny and prejudice are two of the biggest challenges for the advertising and brand communications industries today. Unconscious bias can lead judges to dismiss work they don’t identify with and disregard perspectives from judges they don’t relate to. For the best work in the industry to be rewarded and recognised fairly, jury rooms need to be unaffected by these biases.” Human agrees: “We hope to make the jury more aware of negative stereotypes and unconscious bias, and through that we hope to reward work that doesn’t merely mirror society, but plays an important role in leading society. “I believe it’s important that advertising and design help build a better society, and a huge part of that is breaking down stereotypes. In our region this is especially important in terms of race and gender.” As a founding sponsor of Rare, Google has been instrumental to its growth since 2017, and officially adopted the platform in 2018. “As an industry leader, we feel Google has a responsibility to support the industries it operates in and assist in ushering us all towards a more inclusive, more innovative state,” insists Ranchhod Patel. The Rare Juries interactive short courses use a series of exercises and tutorials to help awards judges learn where their bias comes from, how they can identify a biased thought they’ve had, the terminology to articulate bias, and the process to de-bias a thought or action. Ultimately it will improve the jurors’ cultural literacy, and lead them to celebrate the work that is most deserving. Rare Juries will be running training across all three days of the 2019 Loeries.
