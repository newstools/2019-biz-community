But effectively immediately, I will not purchase any more Dove products. An apology won't do, because whoever posted this ad knew exactly what they were doing. They only "regret" it because of the backlash. They will NOT be getting more of my coins.

Funny wins big when it lands.But not every brand can afford to be funny, let alone pull it off. Never compromise a brand’s ethics to gain a few laughs. Humour is subjective, while your intentions may be pure, you may end up missing the mark and receiving huge backlash – especially when trying to lighten up a heavy subject.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/458975-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The biggest lessons brands can learn from music artists" width="120" height="120">The biggest lessons brands can learn from music artistsSiphiwe Mpeta tackles the topic of personal branding by using music as a frame of reference...By Siphiwe Mpeta 19 Sep 2018      Brands need to learn to walk before they race South Africa is a country with a racially-charged history. Some marketers may be oblivious as to how some cultural stereotypes, instead of landing as humorous, may come across as racist. While it is essential to have discussions from all parties around how we move the nation forward, brands wishing to get into the conversation of race need to be careful how they walk that line.If brands miss the mark, they risk tarnishing their image by grandstanding or diminishing people’s lived experiences to a failed media campaign.Told you'll a long time ago about @OUTsurance.

But getting it right is even better.It is harder for a brand to clean up its tarnished image because they rushed to be first and got it wrong than it is to create and execute a whole well-researched campaign. The costs of not investing in the groundwork for a campaign far outweigh the price and time spent required to getting it right the first time around.
