She explains that being different leads to a different and creative solution, and it is to be considered a superpower.“Without diversity, there wouldn’t be imagination. Without imagination there wouldn’t be innovation,” says McKenty.Admitting to loving being a mom and a creator equally, McKenty’s favourite work includes:-	The Zimbabwean Trillion Dollar campaign-	The Penny Pirate children’s book and app for children’s eye tests campaign-	Kicksticks: the Google special Converse campaign introducing shoes with Bluetooth connectivity to drumsticks to make it possible for those who may not be able to afford a drumset to play/learn to play.-	Kupu: An app for Māori people to translate and provide words for objects in the Māori language. In order to get this right, McKenty says they needed to listen and interpret all feedback they received from indigenous people, and then refine the approach and refine again.Spark Kupu from Colenso BBDO on Vimeo.Google’s care offerings – RARERARE is a platform that allows minorities, businesses and the industry at large to drive – and benefit from – a more diverse, more inclusive culture, explains McKenty.

Collaborate with your marginalised talent on feedback across recruitment processes. Create inclusive criteria across recruitment processes and focus on skills when recruiting rather than character traits, to avoid alienating different talent. Have an on-boarding buddy for every new employee. Identify and make reasonable adjustments to create tailored experiences for the needs of the individuals you are recruiting.And tips for keeping different talent: Get the data of your employees, to understand how included everyone feels in your agency’s culture. Collaborate with ERGs (or other internal I&D resources) to expand support of difference. Remove bias from performance and promotion reviews. Commit to mentoring one employee from a different background, and support sponsorship of employees from diverse groups. Partner with external I&D initiatives (like RARE) and be humble and realise you don’t know everything and there is more to learn.Mckenty ends off with the following advice for creatives: “Find your difference, become a misfit, or for the very least buy a dog!”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/512959.jpg" alt="Loeries tackles cultural awareness with Google's Rare jury training" width="120" height="120">Loeries tackles cultural awareness with Google's Rare jury trainingThe Loeries is only the second international award show, after the D&AD awards, to introduce "unconscious bias" workshops for the judges, during Loeries Creative week, taking place in Durban from 19 August...1 day ago
