According to Boomtown MD, Andrew MacKenzie, “Increased awareness of the value of digital marketing has driven the agency’s focus in this direction. New and existing clients are trusting digital more and it’s not just part of an integrated campaign, it is leading campaigns. Because of this growth, we needed to bolster the department.” An experienced digital marketer, Marais will lead the agency’s innovative thinking forward by placing ‘paid social media’ and ‘always-on content’ into communications strategies. Marais will oversee and create content for campaigns and concepts; and will manage digital and social campaigns with a community management team. Talking about her role at Boomtown, Marais says, “It’s all about the tangible. Many forget that we’re talking to humans, so I like to uncover statistics and insights about people and use them to identify how we want people to feel when they engage with client brands.” “As digital grows, consumers and brands are becoming more aware that it’s not just about growing numbers; it’s about creating engagement. Are we converting, or merely driving traffic? Are we resonating with consumers’ values, or attracting the wrong market? If so, what’s the solution?” The rapidly growing digital team is currently working on three emotive campaigns - a heartfelt Heritage Month campaign for a much-loved South African coffee brand; a digital marketing campaign for Sovereign Foods, one of the country’s largest poultry producers; and an exhilarating Bronx Woman campaign.
