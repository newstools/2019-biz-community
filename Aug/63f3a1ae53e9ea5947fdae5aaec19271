Although most companies acknowledge that a different approach is required to account for women and express satisfaction with efforts to date, just one in five actually tailors the way it sells; the most popular strategies are to add more women to the leading sales team, change internal processes and adapt the negotiation approach. Harassment in the workplace has often come up as a huge challenge women face in this sector and we often try to apologise because of the constant social activities we engage in. As a brown girl, I often have felt that we have had an even tougher time, as I have noticed that some girls of colour might have positions but no decision-making powers. We constantly are short-changed and I feel we have to try harder for leaders in this industry. We still live in a “Mad Men world”. Most women are hopping from brands to brands and agencies to agencies because we find a minimal or maybe no succession plan..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any career highlights you’re particularly proud of?My journey at the broadcaster that allowed me to follow a passion of doing an air talk show. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to/enjoying so far?Following my passion into a purpose.
