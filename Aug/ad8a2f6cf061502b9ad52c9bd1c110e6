Boasting more than the next gen ad superstars, Woolworths Student Portfolio Day also offers the unique opportunity to engage with and scoop up amazing young creatives through employment opportunities, giving agencies the chance to shape young creatives and gain new talent from a group of the very best candidates this industry has to offer.What to expect at the showcaseWoolworths will be awarding a one-year internship to a participating student at this year’s event, and Kate Fordyce, head of the in-house creative agency at Woolworths says she expects “work that is confident, fresh and authentic, relevant to culture and zeitgeist, unexpected and memorable.” at the 2019 Woolworths Student Portfolio Day at Loeries Creative Week.Andrew Human, CEO of the Loeries, describes the showcase as “the one day of the year when the best communications and advertising students showcase their work all in one place, and it’s become so successful that agencies are now pro-actively hiring right from the event.”Why should you hire from Woolworths Student Portfolio Day?The success rate of hiring from this platform is evident when looking at where past students, who began their careers at this very event, have taken their careers as a result of opportunities they received. Carel Scheepers, head of strategy for Havas Africa, attended Loeries Student Portfolio Day in 2017 and says he “knew the best in creative were going to be at the Loeries”, and describes his experience as well as the impact it had on his career and way of thinking: “The work was amazing. The level of work from my peers was phenomenal, and to see the strengths of people in their craft - be it copywriting, conceptualising, illustration or user experience, it was worth every second of it. My portfolio consisted of creative executions as well as creative strategies - both attracted the industry. I remember giving my details to Pepe Marais. As a student/young creative I did not think anything would come from sharing my details, but after the awards weekend, I got the call from Joe Public. I landed the interview and a job. However, due to some unforeseen reasons, I had to turn down the job. I was disheartened. A few months later I went to another interview and they asked me why I should get hired, I responded with "Pepe Marais said I was good enough". I got the job! It is now two years later and I am head of strategy for Havas Africa. Although I did not get the first job, the repercussions that the student portfolio put forward made an immense contribution to my career. Now I put that same thinking and actions forward to help fellow young creatives. It takes one person to see our potential to spark an entire universe of action.” Another successful candidate, Devorah Suttner, junior copywriter at Joe Public United, shares her story, confessing the immense pressure it can place on students, and the rewards that agencies can garner: At the Student Portfolio Day in 2017, I met Pepe Marais, CCO and co-founder of Joe Public United. I didn't actually realise who he, or anyone for that matter, was at the time. It's overwhelming, taking a couple of hundred industry professionals, ECDs, CDs, etc. through your student portfolio. I got a call from Joe Public one week later and shortly after I was offered an internship. Two years later, I'm working at Joe Public United, one of the top agencies in the country as a junior copywriter! My experience at the Loeries was the best thing that could have happened to me in the final year of my Bachelor’s Degree at Vega. In addition to kickstarting my career, it exposed me to award-winning creativity and gave me the chance to meet other young creatives and key industry players from across South Africa, Africa and the Middle East. The day is also a chance for people to onboard fresh and eager talent to their creative team and/or agency. It's a common misconception that people with the most experience have the most to offer. I believe we need a balance of both experienced and inexperienced people in our teams. How else can we grow, personally and creatively, if we don't learn from each other and encourage others to grow?Currently working at FCB Joburg as a junior art director as a result of his attendance at Student Portfolio Day, Olebogeng Tshetlo says:“Student Portfolio Day is a hub of young, top talented creatives in South Africa. It's really simple. Most agencies push for great work. In order to do so, you need talent right! Student Portfolio Day is the place for that.”Don’t miss your chance to snap up this year’s best talent – Get your tickets to Loeries Creative Week now!Visit the Loeries website for more on Woolworths Student Portfolio Day or Loeries Creative Week and keep your eyes on Twitter for updates.For more:Bizcommunity search: Loeries Creative Week DurbanGoogle news search: LoeriesTwitter search: LoeriesOfficial site: www.loeries.com, Facebook, Twitter, InstagramMore info: Creative Week Durban overview
