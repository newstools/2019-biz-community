By understanding the value of customer touchpoints and actions taken, by using a multi-touch attribution model, they are better positioned to make more strategic media allocations, maximising engagements and future conversions. Addressing this important conversation is the Mobile Marketing Association South Africa (MMA SA). It will host a ‘Future of Attribution’ event on 7 August at the Maslow Hotel, Sandton. There, speakers will share insights around methods being used, the challenges and workarounds marketers face to accessing data and explore what data accuracy and transparency really mean. The complexity of multi-touch attribution (MTA), and why it’s so critical will also be discussed.“Marketing has become much more complex, real-time and omni-channel, making it difficult to evaluate the relative impact of individual creative assets deployed across the multiple channels and platforms we use or to shift budgets in-flight, to optimise our spend as soon as we spot opportunities to do so,” comments Luisa Mazinter, MMA SA’s Chair and TymeBank’s Chief Marketing Officer. “Pressure is increasing to reduce wastage and quantify the ROI of each marketing asset deployed along our customers’ path to purchase. Right now I have to use a patchwork of measurement tools to get close to a connected up 360 view. So while implementing a multi-touch Attribution model is a complex undertaking, it promises to help us understand the real business outcomes that are driven by our marketing investments.”Headlining the event is international keynote speaker, Joel Rubinson, MMA MTA expert and President of Joel Rubinson Partners Inc. His talk, ‘A Road Map for Marketers’ success with Multi- Touch Attribution (MTA)’, will identify the challenges and obstacles marketers face in the MTA process and map out the marketers’ journey.Joining him as a speaker is Paul Stemmet from event sponsor OLE!CONNECT who will present ‘The Science & Commercial Wisdom Driving People-Based Marketing’. He says "We're excited to explore the intersect between people based marketing and the attention driven economy and how marketers are reacting to this.” Vincent Maher, Head of Digital Enablement at MultiChoice will also share his MTA project currently being implemented through his entire business using the MMA data map.  “We’re delighted to have such a heavy-weight line-up of speakers, each of whom bring to the table a unique perspective of MTA in action. Through this event we are bringing together marketers, thought leaders and attribution experts to discuss and define the future of marketing measurement and the acceleration tools that will lead the way,” concludes Mazinter.
