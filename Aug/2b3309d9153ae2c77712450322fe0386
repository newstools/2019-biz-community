In Episode 1 of Season 2, Matt strolls through one of London’s financial districts, discussing his experiences with ABM and conversing with clients and potential business partners to determine if the key findings of our ABM research are relevant for the UK market.So, what is ABM, or Account Based Marketing? Unlike traditional marketing methods, which tend to be broad in their focus, ABM treats each client account as an entire market in itself. This allows you to specify an approach that suits the unique needs and values of each client account, improving your chances of converting your prospects into sales. Effective AMB strategies focus on maximum personalisation and engagement with each prospect, accelerating enterprise sales. It’s a relationship: would you rather be with someone who understands you and treats you like you’re special or someone who treats you just like everyone else? A little bit of personalisation goes a long way in unlocking new opportunities. Through personalisation, you can build stronger business relationships and leave a strong impression with your customers so that you and your business are the only logical choice for them. Strap in and check out this episode to learn if ABM is as relevant in the UK as it is in South Africa.TechBytes S2 Episode 1 - The Relevance of ABM in the UK from Digital Kungfu on Vimeo.
