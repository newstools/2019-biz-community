Sorry, what? It’s 2019, people. So if your ‘business writing’ course isn’t 80% email-focused, it’s out of touch. (I almost expected to see ‘how to write a fax’.)<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1508/299492-120x120.jpg" alt="Business writing skills needed more now than ever" width="120" height="120">Business writing skills needed more now than everAccording to the McKinsey Global Institute's research, the average employee spends two and a half hours per day dealing with emails, which is equivalent to 81 working days every year or a quarter of the average working life...31 Jul 2015Now the problem isn’t necessarily with the training company, although one might expect better vetting from them – and higher quality research into what the market needs. The problem is with the trainer. This is why I’m so irate.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1601/328377.jpg" alt="10 simple ways to improve your business writing style" width="120" height="120">10 simple ways to improve your business writing styleWe define a writer's style through his or her word choice and syntax. In business writing, we should choose words and sentence structures that convey our messages in the most effective way...By Amanda Patterson 25 Jan 2016The trainer should be teaching trainees how to read critically, summarise and structure documents and phrase arguments. There should be an emphasis on user behaviour, message planning and editorial quality control. All of this goes way beyond keeping it clear, concise, complete and correct.In fact, the 4 Cs are so entry-level as to constitute basic permission to play.So please listen up, trainers, facilitators and course content developers:If you’re not studiously researching best practices (both global and local), keeping up to date with the skills that business writers in 2019 require and engaging with companies in the real world to find out what kinds of writing skills they need, you’re simply not doing your job. You’re just pretending.You’re part of the reason that so many business-people – even highly educated ones – write badly or inefficiently in today’s workplace.And in case you think that this is an empty rant intended only to draw attention to my business writing training courses, without adding actual value, here’s my take on the supposed 4 Cs of business writing, for the modern world:Before: ClearUh, yes. Obviously. Otherwise, why bother? But: how?The sales blurbs that I saw promised to teach trainees to create business writing that readers could understand without any difficulty. They suggest that writers use “no obscure words” and “no extraneous words”.You mean, words like ‘obscure’ and ‘extraneous’?After: PlainLet’s replace C for clear with P for plain. The simplest, shortest, cleanest, most obvious word in every instance. Nothing must be looked up. Nothing is pretentious. The writer writes to express, not to impress (and so does the trainer.) Clarity goes without saying. Or, at least, it should.Before: ConciseOh for heaven’s sake. Yes. Of course. Leave out adjectives unless you absolutely need them and adverbs under all circumstances.But there’s a lot more to conciseness than qualifiers and modifiers. What about sentence length? Paragraph length? Open space? Lists? Sub-heads? Bolding? Hyperlinks?After: User-centricLet’s replace C for concise with U for user-centric. Make every word count. Consider how the text will look on the page, as well as what it says.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1510/315310-120x120.jpg?2" alt="'You had me at hello' - Five ways to capture your business audience's attention" width="120" height="120">'You had me at hello' - Five ways to capture your business audience's attentionFirst sentences must seduce. The opening line of your copy is like a corporate pick-up line - it must draw your audience in and it must draw them in immediately...By Anthony Ehlers 8 Oct 2015Be generous with visual breathing room. Guide the reader’s eye. Be sensitive to the reader’s time, attention span, medium of choice and information needs.Before: CompleteNo, no, no, no.The goal is not to ensure that the reader has all the information they need, in case they make the wrong decision. That’s how you end up with documents so long your reader wants to jab a pencil in her own eye instead of engaging with it.After: FocusedLet’s replace C for complete with F for focused. The goal, people, is focused and targeted business writing, that is specific to the audience, while also being relevant, timely and considered.Any writing training that does not start with how to identify your audience and how to nail down each message’s specific objective and purpose is a waste of your valuable time and money.Before: CorrectArgh. This one really annoys me. (No, I wasn’t truly annoyed til now. I was just harrumphing for effect.)Obviously your content should be correct. This inane suggestion should go without saying and should be replaced with…         View this post on Instagram           Be mindful of your tone... it's important for your reader's comprehension of your message! #TheWrittenWriteWay #iWriteItAll #EmailEtiquette #ProfessionalEmails #ProfessionalCommunications #HelpWithProfessionalWriting #English #WritingWorkshops #EnglishWorkshops #EnglishLearning #EnglishTutor #GrammarTutor #WritingTutor #Writing #LanguageArts #EnglishLanguage #Writers #Verbiage #Syntax #ProfessionalWriters #BusinessWriting #WritersOfInstagram #HelpWithWriting #WritingHelp #BlackWriter #WomanWriter #WrittenWriteLLC #Nonprofits #Composition #CollegeEnglish A post shared by  Written Write, LLC (@writtenwrite.co) on Aug 8, 2019 at 7:56am PDT After: FriendlyLet’s replace C for correct with something that will make a nice memorable mneumonic for you.

That’s how we should be doing it in 2019.
