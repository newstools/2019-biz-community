It’s paying dividends now and, for example, it’s one of the reasons why more conventional printers can explore opportunities traditionally reserved for the wide-format market. In Southern Africa, production devices unit sales have increased from Q1, 2018 to Q1, 2019, rising by 38 units from 222 to 260. Digital presses popped from 26 to 39 for the same periods, the colour representing all but one of the sales in 2019’s first quarter.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475566-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#BizTrends2019: The revival of print" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: The revival of print"Print is dead" they said, "go digital" they said - we've heard the maxim time and time again and resultantly relegated print to the sidelines, we've left it feeling hapless and irrelevant...By Sam Swaine 14 Jan 2019We project a small contraction in the annual unit sales of the large wide-format market in Southern Africa but it is too early to tell for certain. The first-quarter comparison of this type between 2018 and 2019 saw unit sales drop from 669 to 584 while wide format copier sales rose from 16 to 20 for the same periods but I expect the general economic contraction in South Africa will also impact this market as customers continue to sweat their assets.Direct-to-garment (DTG) is still small but growing steadily from four units in 2018’s first quarter to 11 units in 2019’s first quarter. A total of 28 of the new devices were sold in Southern Africa the whole of last year, so first-quarter growth bodes well for the industry this year and early projections are optimistic.Challenges One of the major challenges for the vendors and the printers is the sales approach. The industry continues to use the traditional broadcast approach and the narrow-cast sales visit. Vendor salespeople routinely focus on their specific solutions rather than casting their net wider to include the base unit with the value-adding extended software solution capabilities and business development opportunities.It’s an understandable approach since the devices are more capable and therefore more complex. But it suffers myopia that leads to margin wars rather than extending the vision of providing value that grows revenues at a time when the South African economy is seen by many to be on the ropes and customers are trying to squeeze returns on their investments. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/483613.jpg" alt="Getting emotional with print marketing" width="120" height="120">Getting emotional with print marketingInteractivity certainly adds an interesting and potentially effective dimension to marketing, but perhaps it's simply a 21st century expression of a much older marketing truth: emotion sells...By James de Waal, Issued by Canon SA 21 Feb 2019There is still opportunity, particularly in solutions that break from the traditional mould, but much of it goes untapped.Multifunction devices are globally seeing a general uptick in unit sales but not in Southern Africa. Unit sales dipped from the first quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2019, dropping by 773 units overall but still achieving a healthy 17,319 unit sales in 2019.Their popularity hinges on them being connected devices spread throughout enterprises. They are the conduit by which many businesses get a digital image of their physical operations that feeds a range of business imperatives, such as digital transformation, advanced analytics and, in a few cases, even machine learning (ML).Security, however, is a key concern that the print vendors are focusing a lot of attention on.
