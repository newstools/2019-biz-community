Which celebrity would be your perfect match?16 Apr 2019Straight outta sci-fi fantasyWhilst the film may seem something out of a fantasy sci-fi, it’s sadly a portrayal of real-world events and depicts Cambridge Analytica’s leadership team giggling over the fact that they’d won the campaign for their client; a client who persuaded voters knowingly and impacted the future of an entire country.As a result of its involvement, Facebook was forced to pay a fine of $5bn. Given that the company earns some $15bn in revenue per quarter, this is hardly even a slap on the wrist and has not even impacted shareholders with the stock price remaining stable.There are many angles with which to depict this story; the data angle, the human rights angle, but what begs the greatest question in my mind is the leadership angle and how data needs to be integrated at board-level as a key topic for discussion. As a head of marketing, I’m familiar with the tools at hand to deliver the right message to the right person at the right time. In marketing circles, we call it personalisation. Ideally, it’s about delivering relevant content to people who expect to see that content with a view to engaging. Data got you in its swayWhat Cambridge Analytica did was to take a few steps too far and manipulate the behaviour of certain people according to their ability to be ‘swayed’ based on feeding them ‘false’ information. One wonders where the board of the firm was at this time. They were the ones condoning such action and even creating the structures needed to support it. A bankruptcy petition for May 2018 noted that Cambridge Analytica LLC had also operated under other names. On the bankruptcy petition, Rebekah Mercer and Jennifer Mercer are listed as being the governing board of Cambridge Analytica, daughters of Robert Mercer, the billionaire who donated to US President Donald Trump’s campaign.'The Great Hack' documentary literally made me sick to my stomach. Especially the part where they showed how they influenced elections and created division among people across the world ��N.B. last year DATA surpassed OIL in value.

My point is that with the ever-increasing rise of AI (artificial intelligence) and data points, leaders need to not only equip themselves with the necessary skills and knowledge to ask the right questions but to consider the needs and, indeed, even the rights of their customers first and foremost. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/512545.jpg" alt="Prepare your business to benefit from AI" width="120" height="120">Prepare your business to benefit from AIIf data is the new oil, artificial intelligence (AI) can arguably be its best drill, able to uncover insights and mine real business value from the huge and complex data sets that typify modern organisations.By Rudeon Snell 21 Aug 2019Data is not the enemy. It’s a tool, which harnessed correctly, can create a positive and profound impact on the lives of customers. What’s needed to enable this are leadership teams who can leverage data with wisdom and are committed to delivering systemic value.
