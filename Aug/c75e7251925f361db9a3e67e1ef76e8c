Through a process of elimination, three contestants will win a year-long contract within the marketing department where they can expand on their skills and gain even more knowledge than ever before.While the show is set to change the lives of the 12 finalists who embark on the journey, ultimately, the show also hopes to impart some wisdom to viewers at home who are encouraged to use the findings learned and shared by the finalists on the series to change their approach to business.Imparting wisdom Nandi Madida, businesswoman and musician, says that the series is a game-changer for South African television as a whole. “This show is what the nation desires,” she says. “It’s a show that is on the pulse of all things needed in the workplace. It’s a show of substance and truly shows the audience that nothing is impossible to a willing heart.” Meanwhile, Sylvester Chauke, CEO of PR consultancy agency DNA Brand Architects, highlights the point that the show is set to give viewers some important learnings to take home and incorporate into the way they do business. “The show is more than just the contestants that are participating on the show. The lessons embedded in the challenges are such that viewers at home will gain pointers on how to tackle very common challenges in the job search and skills required in order to solve problems, nonmatter the industry. Young people will enjoy the show but they will also walk away with some valuable tips and tricks they too can use.”J Walter Thompson (JWT) CEO Odette van der Haar adds that the challenges are constructed in way to test the skills of the finalists while teaching viewers at home some of the fundamentals within the marketing industry.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511332.jpg" alt="The future looks bright for student entrepreneurs" width="120" height="120">The future looks bright for student entrepreneursMore often than not, the key to successful entrepreneurship isn't about who has the best idea or marketing plan...2 days ago“There is a general lack of awareness that the industry is a career destination and that young people who are inherently creative talent can use their creativity to build a successful, professional and highly rewarding career or business,” she says.“South Africa needs more creative thinkers, more entrepreneurs who use creativity to generate an income, contributing to the economy and, in so doing, creating more jobs. This show will not only change the lives of three young people by catapulting them into their careers in marketing, it’ll showcase the importance of creativity which is more often than not undervalued and/or misunderstood.”   The Next Brand Ambassador is broadcast on SABC 3 at 7.30pm on Thursdays.
