Boombadotmobi is a waste management business that tries to reduce illegal dumping by collecting waste from its source, connecting waste generators with waste collectors and ensuring that the waste is disposed of responsibly. ‘Winning the Rising Star Award means recognition of the work I am doing in the community, and it will enable me to buy the tech I need to automate the business’, says Nondumiso. Start-ups starting to take the environment into accountThe prizes awarded to the three winners are: R80,000 in cash to the Woman of the Future, R50,000 each in cash to the Rising Star and Social Entrepreneur and, to all the winners, an invaluable mentorship session with one of the judges, a luxury beauty hamper from Clarins (beauty sponsor), a short course from the IMM Graduate School worth R15,000, a Karissa business bag and spinner from Samsonite worth R7,298, a ladies watch from Obaku worth R2,195, a R1,000 shopping voucher from Superbalist, a pamper session from Camelot Spa and a media training session. ‘It’s so interesting how start-ups are changing to take the environment into account,’ says Fairlady editor Suzy Brokensha. Although they are judged on the success and potential success of their initiatives, all three of these women are creating businesses that are contributing not only to the South African economy but also to improving our country by creating job opportunities for others, enabling people to feed themselves and turning waste collection into profit. That’s what we love about women in business, and that’s why Fairlady believes so strongly in this annual award and partnership.Guests in attendance at the luncheon included businesswomen Basetsana Kumalo, Wendy Luhabe; Miss South Africa 2019 Zozibini Tunzi, media personalities Sonia Booth, Penny Lebyane, Lesego Tlhabi (aka Coconut Kelz), Gina Myers, Zoe Mthiyane and Liesl Laurie.
