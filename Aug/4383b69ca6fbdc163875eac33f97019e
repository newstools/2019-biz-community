Image source: Gallo/Getty.This year’s conference will explore the theme: Investing in research, investing in brands, investing in Africa, and PAMRO is delighted at the quality and range of speakers and topics at this year’s conference, including:Keld Nielsen, Kantar, who will take delegates on a whistle-stop tour across the globe in a quest to explore, Is TV dead?. The presentation will look at how various markets are addressing the challenges in currency audience measurement such as, viewer fragmentation; over addressable advertising; measurement of online broadcast video consumption; SVOD services and; out of home viewing.Pushkar Kulkarni and Neema Wamai, Ipsos, will present, Simple Passive Solutions to Disruptive Challenges, which builds on their white paper presented on Audience Measurement 5.0 at the conference in Lagos, Nigeria. Ipsos has continued to invest in advanced technology that merges passive simplicity with science to allow brands a deep dive into the data to access actionable insights. These techniques encompass all media, whether it is ‘MediaCell’, an app-based mobile passive metre to measure across video and audio, or cross-platform ‘Mobitest’ metres that have enhanced out of home audience measurement, or even the hybridisation of data that makes readership surveys more comprehensive.Caroline Atford, MD of Nielsen Media New Zealand, takes a look at Readership Currency - The Journey to Mixed Sample Methodology. New Zealand is evolving the collection of readership currency samples from a 100% face-to-face paper survey to collection via an online panel and has employed Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) for completion of an online survey. Atford delves into the challenges on this journey and how Nielsen has managed the process to ensure the currency remains robust and reflective of the population.Jonathon Wells, MD Data Science Nielsen International Media, meanwhile presents a paper on Brand Target Audiences for Print/Digital Campaigns. Marketers have relied on a traditional approach for defining the target audience for a newspaper or magazine campaigns which incorporated standard demographics such as age, gender, income and socio-economic status. In many cases, however, this approach can lead to a waste in advertising spend because the target group is not fully contained within the demographic definition. To address this issue Nielsen has fused the Homescan consumer panel onto the PAMS readership survey in South Africa. The fused database provides a link between the readership of newspapers and magazines and actual purchases of a wide range of products and brands. This approach presents an opportunity for advertisers to pinpoint the precise audience of a campaign and optimise their print advertising schedules.This year PAMRO celebrates its 20th anniversary, that’s 20 years of research experts from across Africa and the rest of the world coming together to exchange knowledge and to learn from one-another’s successes and failures, with the ultimate goal of harmonising research methodologies and encouraging excellence in the industry. #PAMRO2019 is in proud partnership with DSTV Media Sales, Nielsen, GeoPoll, Ornico, Plus 94, Telmar and Ipsos.
