Introducing ‘Black Twitter’. The formidable and creative movement that leaves no person safe and no wit uncensored, while tackling matters of common interest or relatable content amongst the black community.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/492020-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: Getty/Gallo Images." width="120" height="120">How far Black Twitter has comeBlack Twitter in South Africa has become an autonomous space that has grown a life of its own...By Rebone Masemola 11 Apr 2019A global and local perspectiveIt is imperative to distinguish that while the term “Black Twitter” exists globally, in South Africa, it is essentially just Twitter. In the United States, Black Twitter has a more sombre description, it is used to illuminate issues that affect black communities (i.e. Gun violence, LGBTQIA+ rights, black women’s rights etc).This has seen socio-economic issues go viral, memorable moments created and heightened awareness on topics that inform and empower others with similar or relatable experiences. The platform proved to be so successful, that it has become a sub-culture that is now used to mobilise social justice movements.‘#BlackLivesMatter movement was started by queer ppl’ — BLOOP.#themoreyouknow ���� @itstarekali pic.twitter.com/ExTLANaGKM— noelskis���� (@yo_noels) August 16, 2019In the US alone, Black Twitter is responsible for multiple equality campaigns, with the most prominent being #BlackLivesMatter and #MeToo.In South Africa, its use and unique perspectives are simply a daily diatribe of predominantly millennial and post-millennial audiences. There isn’t a day that passes where a new and interesting Twitter trend does not materialise, creating heated discussion."The Chinese are wrong for fighting for their freedom coz it inconveniences me, my comfort is more important than everyone else."

The mentality on Twitter locally has created an unassuming behaviour that many brands assume operates for humorous reasons. While this may be true, it extends to actively championing for progressive change.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475595-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Screengrab from ." width="120" height="120">Which South African brands won on Twitter this year?Twitter has shared which South African brands won Twitter in 2018 across themes like brand voice, use of 6-second video, brand purpose, and launch moments...21 Dec 2018Brands that misunderstand Twitter in South Africa make the mistake of not always knowing the audience or topic at hand.

If the opinion or tweet is unwarranted or invalidated, the exchange and effort at being included are as good as over and the accompanying PR team may need to be notified.Getting a brand a presence on Black Twitter is something that needs to carefully considered because once a brand is in, they are in.However, when the perfect chord is struck and something relatable, funny and substantial has taken off on the platform it often achieves viral status – for all of the right reasons. It is in this specific phase that tweets will receive the highest engagement if attached to the trending hashtag.I can already imagine what #Jesus is thinking when he sees this clown pretending to be him in Africa ���� pic.twitter.com/a6X1h7lJTA— B.k���� (@bandileBk030) July 29, 2019An example of this was when the #ScoPaTuMaana viral tweet – which when translated means ‘I have an opinion on’ – critically analysed a number of taboo situations in South Africa. This Twitter call-to-action prompted varying opinions about a variety of conversation-starters on topics like mothers, money matters, food and awkward situations.How useful would it be though if K53 was taught in LO?

However, soon other ethnic groups began to descend on the trend, stating that those childhood experiences weren’t as ‘black’ as one might think, as many of them had the same mind-boggling but hilarious childhood memories.Twitter surpassed the ethic experience when it became clear how many South Africans had been told as children to switch off the television as “it needed to rest”.Twitter in South Africa is at the frontier of being understood and used effectively as far as brands are concerned. It has no limits, understands almost all topics and, is unashamedly, Proudly South African.
