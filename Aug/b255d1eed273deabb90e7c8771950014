I gravitated towards crane operation simply because I find heights very fascinating. Fortunately enough, I was exposed to various sites and that’s when my interest in safety on site began. I approached the Enza HR team about my passion, and they were open to helping me grow. Back then, I only had standard nine (grade 11), so the company assisted me in gaining admission at a safety institution based on my work experience. In 2017 I successfully completed my SAMTREC qualification at NOSA. In order to ensure that I acquired experience as a safety officer, Enza allocated me a mentor and exposed me to various sites..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Describe for us a typical day in your job?My day starts with tool box talks - we discuss various factors that may compromise workers' safety on site and, once done, how we can better address them. I then move to the site walk down where I inspect various areas to ensure that the environment is safe for people to work. If there is an issue that needs to be addressed, I do so immediately with my team with the help of the area supervisors. Currently, I spend most of my day inducting people on site. We welcome many guests on a daily basis, which is why I ensure that people are well inducted and know what is required of them, be it on-site or off-site. Prior to leaving work, I do a site inspection; this is normally to ensure that all identified issues are addressed, as well as to see if the site is still safe..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Is working in construction a passion for you?Yes, it is. I do not see myself anywhere else other than a construction site. You get the most fulfilling feeling ever when you complete a project, and there are no injuries, long-term injuries or fatalities, and you know that you were part of that. When you pass a place, you are even able to tell your children, “I did that.”.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}As a woman in a male-dominated field, what have been some of the challenges you've faced, and how have you overcome them?Not being taken seriously by my male counterparts was probably the biggest challenge I faced in the beginning, but I did not let it discourage me. It pushed me to work hard to prove that I am not just a female, but deserved a seat at the table. I have made use of the toolbox talks to address this and gain the trust of my male colleagues. We now work well together to a point that they come to me for advice and recommendation. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/510754-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Michelle Goliath played a major role in establishing the first ethically sourced, fair, women-owned, artisanal diamond process." width="120" height="120">#WomensMonth: Creating a space for women artisanal minersMichelle Goliath has a passion for helping the most vulnerable people in society who have run out of conventional employment options...13 hours ago.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What advice would you give to other women looking to pursue a career in construction?We are more than capable. We grew up being told things women can and cannot do in terms of work or a career. However, due to different work roles, I have learned that we are equals not just in strength, but in capability as well. Reach for your dreams, the only limitation you have is yourself..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Is there a female figure that has had a positive influence on your life?My older sister - she encouraged me to come to Joburg. Had I not taken the leap I would not be where I am today. Professionally, it has to be the HR executive at Enza Ms Navisha Mitoo - she gave me an opportunity. She was also accessible and helpful throughout the journey.  .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is your message for Women's Month?Dream, and don’t just stop at dreaming, follow those dreams.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
