She studied Information Technology and specialised in Software Development at the Walter Sisulu University in East London. She is efficient in a number of programming languages including Java, C++ and VB.Net.What is your role here at Realm Digital?My role is to be the gatekeeper of the quality of software that our development team produces. Before any work is presented to a client, it needs to go past me to make sure we’re delivering the best possible product, which will ultimately result in a happy client. I review the end product to ensure that everything is working properly and that the site is fully functional in accordance with the design and agreed scope of work.It’s also about challenging developers to write code that is not just ‘good enough’, but ‘good for the user’. How did you get interested in this field?As someone who grew up in a rural area, it was very exciting for me when I got to high school and saw a computer for the first time. At that point, all we really did was play games and click around trying to figure it all out. It was then that I decided I wanted to go to university to study IT. During your first year, when you are exposed to the different spheres in IT, I discovered that I didn’t want to work with the hardware, but rather the backend. It is then when I decided to pursue the programming side of things. Do you think young women are being encouraged to pursue a career in technology?I think that even if girls maybe aren’t being encouraged to pursue a career in this field, they can see for themselves where the world is going, and where there are opportunities. Some may believe that IT, much like engineering, is only for men, but young women are starting to see for themselves that with the rise of gender equality in the world, this perception is being challenged.I’m not sure if they’re really being encouraged to pursue it, but they are definitely pushing themselves.What is your biggest challenge in a predominantly male-driven industry?I’ve never really felt the pressure of working in a male-dominated field. Growing up I was considered to be a bit of a tom-boy, so I personally don’t feel like I’m in a male-dominated environment. I find it easier working with guys, than with girls, which comes with its own set of challenges. Any advice for women who are interested in pursuing a future in technology?I would encourage them to go for it. It is an interesting field to be in, quite challenging at times, but interesting. Technology is the future, and the future is filled with more women occupying this space.
