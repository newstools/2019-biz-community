Pyrotec PackMark provides a vast portfolio of world-class, locally supplied coding equipment for every category of packaging, including primary, secondary and tertiary coding and labelling applications. Primary coding is applied to the layer of packaging that comes into direct contact with the product, protecting it while it’s stored and transported. It’s also the consumer-facing component that’s seen at point of purchase. For high-quality printing on primary packaging, the SmartDate X30 from Markem-Imaje – locally available from Pyrotec PackMark offers the fastest print and acceleration/deceleration speeds. The X30 also offers multiple ribbon saving features. A wide array of approved high-quality thermal transfer ribbons is available for both flat and near edge printheads. For the food sector, the SmartDate X30 excels for coding on to flow wrappers, bags, tray seals, pouches, sachets, vacuum packs and labels.

This reduces costs while print quality remain constant year after year.
