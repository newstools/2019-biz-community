In terms of entries, we’ve seen an increase in the number of PR campaigns, as well as PR agencies, so it seemed appropriate to give the discipline its own big prize.”Epica defines PR operations as “campaigns in the field of press relations, public affairs, crisis management, lobbying, community and influencer management, financial communications and stakeholder relations” as well as “projects and activities specifically devised to generate earned media”.Time to get your work truly tested..
