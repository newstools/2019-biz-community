<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/509924.jpg" alt="Gagasi FM media statement" width="200" height="200">Gagasi FM have engaged with the Presenters about the premature termination of their contracts, their departure from the station and the legal implications of their contractual obligations to Gagasi FM.Gagasi FM has noted that this is the second occasion in less than 6 months that an SABC Station has targeted Gagasi FMâ€™s primetime talent in the middle of their contracts and in a hastily manner. Nevertheless, Gagasi FM has consistently displayed its ability to groom and to identify talent, and actions by SABC radio stations over the past few months seem to affirm this.The station is in the process of finalising its line-up in response to the sudden departure of Sphe and Naves. In the meantime, DJ Sonic will join Clarissa to host the Afternoon Drive as a stand-in. Njinga will stand-in for Sonic on his evening slot on weekdays between 10pm and 1am.All other shows will continue as per the normal time channels and an announcement will be made about the future of the afternoon drive show in due course.
