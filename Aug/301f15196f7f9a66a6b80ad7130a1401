Catch a wave. Stand. Surf. (Part 1)Loyiso 'The Victor' Twala, an FCB creative was sent to LeaderSurf as part of FCB Joburg's skills transfer and training programme. Here, he gives feedback on what he experienced and how it has changed him forever...By Loyiso "The Victor" Twala 12 Mar 2018That's why Torr's CEM Africa Summit presentation was largely based on customer experience or CX lessons we can learn as a shot at the world's most famous 'big wave' venue — Praia do Norte, Nazaré, Portugal. That's where professional diver Sérgio Cosme is based. An adventurer at heart, he's done it all, from motocross to rally car racing, but his current passion is all about being a rescue jet ski driver on the biggest days at Nazaré. He outruns mountains of swell over 20 metres high to save up the surfers attempting to ride them, which puts him in one of the highest stakes positions in sport, yet he's not driven by money or accolades - it's all about mitigating risk and building trust in salvaging what could be a deadly experience... Explaining why he feels all brands should strive to be more like Cosme, Torr said he's ticking all the CX boxes: Taking care of his customer and the environment; putting their safety first; communicating his own knowledge and expertise precisely and timely, in 'surfer talk' they can relate to; and onboarding the surfer properly to help build confidence; while providing an exact service by immersing himself in the different surfer needs that arise. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/444501-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Loeries2018: Suhana Gordhan's advertising journey (Part 1)" width="120" height="120">#Loeries2018: Suhana Gordhan's advertising journey (Part 1)Loeries chair aunty and creative director at FCB Africa, Suhana Gordhan shares what creativity means to her and lessons in leadership she's learnt along her journey in advertising from the boys' locker room to the beaches of Nicaragua...By Jessica Tennant 13 Jun 2018Simply put, in the business of surfing, Cosme trades on trust: You want to have the best possible experience, but you also want to be safe.Cue all businesses to take note.Putting on his customer hat, Torr spoke of his personal loyalty to a specific airline, based on the continuous excellent customer experience he receives from them.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495569-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Experience trumps channel" width="120" height="120">Experience trumps channelBrands need to show up in relevant environments with tailored offerings and a seamless purchasing journey...By Refilwe Maluleke 6 May 2019It starts with the process of booking his flight online for business, where the user experience (UX) is first and foremost, as everything in the online booking process interface is seamless and flows in a way that makes sense. Having booked his seat, he receives an SMS (his personal preference of communication method) reminding him to check-in online. Given a clear upsell option to upgrade his seat - as opposed to an unpleasant surprise at the checkout phase - Torr accepts and also completes the safety check, which has been gamified to a point that it’s entertaining, not something to ignore. Marrying experience: Bringing online excellence offlineMet with a professional staffer at the boarding gate, Torr's excellent experience continues throughout the physical flight. He confirms the service he received has changed his behaviour in that he doesn’t even try looking for cheaper flights any more.He's willing to pay a bit extra for that excellent customer experience.The best part is that this experience is holistic, as it translates from the physical to the digital and back again. While this is the best possible way for customer experience to roll-out, remember that excellent customer experience is often based on an interaction with a single person, which is why it's important to employ those who are truly passionate about the work they do.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/509848-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#CEM19: Once you've lost consumers' trust, how do you re-establish it?

KPMG respondsIgnatius Sehoole, CEO of KPMG SA's honest keynote presentation at the 8th annual CEM Africa Summit was a highlight for many. He said, "We know where we are, we know how we got here, and we have started our journey of renewal. Our ongoing task is to re-establish trust of the SA business community and society." Here's how they're doing so...By Leigh Andrews 1 day agoTorr reminded attendees that trust is built through first impressions, which is often down to the impact of the tone and language used in your  SMS or the call-to-action button at the moment of interaction.Torr says to follow through on every touchpoint of the customer experience journey, which involves speaking regularly to your internal users and customers.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506377-120x120.jpg?2" alt="From customer journey mapping to journey management" width="120" height="120">From customer journey mapping to journey managementThere's a story to each customer interaction your company has - a beginning, middle and an end. Some of these interactions can be incredibly influential, while others are simply an essential means to an end; all are relevant to business success...By Antony Adelaar 11 Jul 2019MC Africa Melane pointed out that there's a fine balance as to the point it becomes too much when talking to the customer, as we don’t want to receive daily Mailchimp surveys. Torr agreed that there's no blanket methodology as it's all based on how your specific brand's customers follow their customer journey and how often is too often to follow up. Work to uncover the no secret sauce of interaction that's best for your own business - this involves research into what the customer needs at various stages of the journey and analysing data for insights into the UX and overall CX, so be open to feedback and tweaking the process as you go along. Lessons any business can take to heart. Watch for my further coverage of the CEM Africa Summit.
