The MasterClass will be centred around the role that advertising plays in socioety, with a panel discussion that will include experts from UN Women’s Unstereotype Alliance, Dove, the media, the advertising industry and a transgender activist who was featured in Dove’s global #ShowUs campaign. The UN Unstereotype Alliance, of which Unilever is a Vice Chair and the Loeries is the first ally member in Africa, centres around eradicating harmful gender-based stereotypes in all media and advertising content.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511863.jpg" alt="The Loeries and Dove Telling Better Stories together" width="625" height="525">Dove believes that beauty is for everyone and that the way people are represented in the media is important – it has a significant impact on how we see ourselves, on self-esteem and on self-worth.“I think people across the globe all want similar things – to love and be loved, to be happy, and to be successful are some universal desires. However, the way in which we communicate things – our feelings and emotions – differs across societies and we have to be sensitive and mindful to build people up in all forms of advertising,” says Loeries CEO, Andrew Human. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511867.jpg" alt="Photo credit: Masego Morulane" width="625" height="417">Photo credit: Masego Morulane“Through the Masterclass, we aim to promote courage within the creative community to have honest conversations, tell real stories and interrogate the power that brand communicators hold. They play a very significant role in driving change within their sphere of influence, and, in turn, that power and influence can be used to address the issue of misrepresentation of women on media and advertising platforms. This is exciting and powerful,” explains Sphelele Mjadu, Unilever Personal Care Senior Public Relations Manager for Africa.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511868.jpg" alt="Photo credit: Masego Morulane" width="625" height="386">Photo credit: Masego Morulane“Seventy-one percent of South African women don’t feel represented in media and advertising, and this is why Dove, together with Girlgaze, Getty Images, and women everywhere, have come together to create Project #ShowUs – the world’s largest photo library created by women and non-binary individuals to provide a resource that hopes to spark a tangible transformation within the industry.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511869.jpg" alt="The Loeries and Dove Telling Better Stories together" width="625" height="568">The library of over 5,000 images from 39 countries is available for the media and advertising industries to view, license and use in their projects and campaigns. “Working with the Loeries, we can reach creative industry decision makers who can have real impact and help drive a shift with brands to be more inclusive and representative of women and non-binary individuals across the world. This is very important to us, because gone are the days when a brand can just ‘say’ the right things – with this campaign we are ‘doing’ and the impact is effecting real change and making a difference,” says Mjadu. Dove would like to end Loeries Creative Week with pledges from industry decision makers on how Project #ShowUs can be brought to life in their work through more diverse and inclusive representation of women.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511870.jpg" alt="Photo credit: Olivia Mortimer" width="625" height="353">Photo credit: Olivia MortimerDove holds that in an ideal world, the definition of beautiful is authentic, diverse and what every woman says it is, for themselves. “The idea of beauty is fluid, personal yet universal; we want to celebrate that, and real women everywhere. Dove’s mission is to inspire women to develop a positive relationship with the way they look and realise their full potential. Project #ShowUs helps women to see themselves represented and celebrated – making it easier to celebrate themselves. And that is beautiful,” concludes Mjadu.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511871.jpg" alt="Photo credit: Masego Morulane" width="625" height="403">Photo credit: Masego MorulaneThe Loeries is the only award across Africa andf the Middle East that informs the global WARC Creative 100, a showcase for the best creative work in the world.
