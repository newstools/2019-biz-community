But magazine publishers have to look at what they can do to futureproof themselves, such as becoming brands with a multi-channel focus with content continuing to play a central role.Successful magazines are able to deliver exceptional content and translate it to different audiences through multiple touchpoints that include both digital and print as they no longer can afford to have a single-channel focus.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/494159-120x120.jpg?2" alt="When brands get social media engagement right" width="120" height="120">When brands get social media engagement rightSocial media has become an increasingly valuable component for consideration with a lot of PR strategies over the years.

Doing this at different touchpoints and at all levels of the business will keep the brand’s revenue constant.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/485697-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Print advertising in the top 10 of consumer touchpoints" width="120" height="120">Print advertising in the top 10 of consumer touchpointsIn the latest research commissioned by the Publisher Research Council (PRC), print advertising cracks the top 10 in the automotive category, placing second, clipped only by television, in the 'paid for' touchpoints...5 Mar 2019Deloitte estimates that by the end of 2020, the proportion of subscription to advertising revenue for publishers will be 50:50 in digital.

It has done exceptionally well to move from the shelf into the hands of the consumer – every month more than 500,000 Smart Shoppers pick up a copy of the magazine if they swipe their loyalty card.This is an excellent example of a successful, integrated marketing approach. While the magazine is free to subscribers, customers still must make a conscious choice to put it in their baskets, for the stock to move.

In addition, the content is absolutely targeted to the Pick ‘n Pay shopper. The magazine has demonstrated an acute awareness of what its customers want and need and then creating quality custom content to match this.Research suggests that there is a direct link between the Pick ‘n Pay stock profiled on the cover of the Fresh Living Magazine and sales for that month, demonstrating the unique influence that the magazine brand has on the value to customers.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504693.jpg" alt="An SA first: Fresh Living magazine now in Braille" width="120" height="120">An SA first: Fresh Living magazine now in BraillePick n Pay's Fresh Living magazine is now available in Braille, making it the first supermarket in South Africa to offer something like this to its customers...Issued by John Brown 2 Jul 2019Understanding your audience, creating valuable content Another successful example is the Foschini Group, which has – according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations of South Africa – a solid hold on the youth category with their publications ClubX and Kids Superclub that showed a growth in circulation.These publications target different ages within the youth category and they are a good example of how understanding your audience well and delivering content that adds value to their life can ensure success.One of the challenges magazines has is global content: many publications rely on global content, which does not always fully resonate with local audiences.When global titles came to South Africa they were able to add constructive debate to issues relevant at the time, such as women’s rights or freedom of expression, for example, which resonated with the South African audience because no one was talking about it here yet.However, today magazines have to repurpose global content to make it relevant for the South African audience as digital media means that consumers are today much savvier and in the know. This is in addition to magazines needing to create meaningful local content from scratch.I used to dream about writing for magazines, now they write about me.

Khan (@JamilFarouk) August 19, 2019Magazines have a unique advantage in that they evoke a positive feeling in the reader, with global research suggesting that consumers have a more favourable reaction to printed advertising compared to many other media platforms.The reader makes a conscious choice to pick up a magazine to access its content. Readers will always pay for quality content – no matter the channel, and if the product is sub-standard, like any business, it won’t survive.Recognising this will help the magazine industry remain agile and continue to play an important role in today’s media landscape.
