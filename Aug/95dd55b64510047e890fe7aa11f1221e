The all women-team that led the pitch campaign came with a different approach based on a clear understanding of FADT’s business needs and reflects the next generation marketing and media solution for marketers and brands as provided by Ole!Connect.Hoisting the "women in digital" flag, it's notable, too, that Ole!Connect’s Marketing Division was founded by a woman, the key roles of business unit director and head of development are today filled by women, and the board is headed by a female executive chairman, the well-respected Deseré Orrill.Another series of account wins for Ole!Connect sees the marketing division expanding its work within the First Rand Group.
