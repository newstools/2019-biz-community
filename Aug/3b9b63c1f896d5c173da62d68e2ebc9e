This points to the increased complexity of integration – with UX, CX, and EX happening across an increasingly diverse set of brand interaction point; customers multi-tasking with media forms; and simultaneous media consumption.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/503902-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Effectively integrating digital and real-world retail" width="120" height="120">Effectively integrating digital and real-world retailDigital transformation has been a hot button topic across industry sectors in recent times. But what does this digital shift mean for retailers and brands looking for a different in-store consumer experience?By Gareth Smith 27 Jun 2019<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/502408-120x120.jpg?2" alt="PR, media and social media should all be in the same WhatsApp group" width="120" height="120">PR, media and social media should all be in the same WhatsApp groupPR practitioners should be the ones who are there when media buying strategies are being curated, sold to clients and engagements are taking place with media houses to negotiate further how brands can leverage that media spend for PR deliverables...By Khangelani Dziba 19 Jun 2019This is coupled with agile marketing, if marketers cannot know everything before we start with integration; we should create – and allow customers to co-create – systems that readily incorporate change. Maybe it is time to dissect that 11-letter word against this background…I  - Involvement This refers to strategic involvement at board level by marketing executives who are part of the C-suite. This implies that to optimise integration, marketing executives should contribute to strategic thinking at board level and focus less on more tactical work.The caveat here is, of course, that the marketing executive should have a deep understanding of stakeholder integration, organisational integration and environmental integration.N  -  NeutralityIn developing truly integrated marketing and communication strategies, marketers should essentially be neutral in their media choices (i.e., ‘media neutral’).All communication options should be considered based on effectiveness (e.g., how many desirable influences does communication create through the selected media and what communication objectives does it help the brand to achieve?) and efficiency (e.g., at what cost are those influences created and objectives achieved?).Thus, any means of communication that will effectively and efficiently facilitate the intended objectives should be considered.T  - TeamworkIntegration undoubtedly calls for cross-functional teamwork in the organisation and across agency relationships. Teamwork is required because everything the organisation (through its organisational teams and employees) says and doesn’t say, and does and doesn’t do, sends out a message.Integration is everybody’s business in the organisation.E  - EngagementEngagement is important in managing stakeholder relationships because of the overlap, interdependence and interaction between stakeholders – a synergy that creates value for the organisation and its brand.Brand equity is an outcome of a field of relationships and adding value is a non-linear active process that involves constant and overlapping exchanges, connections and responses.G  - Goal-directedIntegration should be goal-directed. The strategic intent of the organisation helps management to direct its goals with purpose.The strategic intent of the organisation should drive all its marketing and communication to ensure unity of effort in organisational functioning, based on what is learned from the stakeholders and the environment.R  - Resource commitmentIntegration implementation requires a resource commitment that addresses the importance of the availability to employ time, funds, skilled and knowledgeable professionals and other resources.A  - AdaptationThe organisation must learn from and adapt to its environment to position itself according to external needs.Doing so enables the entire organisation to think strategically and to create synergy by sharing its knowledge and ideas and by fostering actions that are in the interests of the organisation.This implies that there should be an overall acceptance and awareness that the organisation is functioning in an environment where changes are taking place, and that adaptation is inevitable.T  - Total brand experienceIntegration requires a strategic orientation on the part of the organisation; strategists must manage aggressively and drive the total brand experience. These professionals need to contribute to the business bottom line by consistently coordinating all the organisation’s communications.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/510300-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Fernanda Rodríguez on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Much of brand management is a hit-and-miss affair. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn'tThe process of brand management is not as complicated as a lot of non-brand or marketers sees it...By Rirhandzu Shingwenyana 1 day agoThe total brand experience from an integration perspective is based on three ideas: the messaging and delivery method/medium must be stakeholder-appropriate; there must be continuing dialogue to ensure a 360° brand idea and the timing of messages should be built on stakeholder preferences. I  - InteractivityInsufficient emphasis had been placed on ensuring interactivity between the organisation, its agencies and its stakeholders. Interactivity from a stakeholder’s perspective means accessibility, recognition, responsiveness and accountability.From a brand perspective, it means the ability to listen as well as speak and then to modify behaviour because of the feedback. Interactivity is the process by which customers are integrated into the organisation, co-creating product planning and the development process and are dealt with as individuals.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477714.jpg" alt="Turning data into opportunity: The intelligence every business needs" width="120" height="120">Turning data into opportunity: The intelligence every business needsFind out why business intelligence software is a necessary tool in today's digital age, and how it can be used, simply and effectively...Issued by B2IT 15 Jan 2019To be interactive, the organisation must place as much emphasis on receiving messages as it does on sending them. Interactivity creates a long-term, purposeful dialogue that is mutually beneficial for the stakeholder and the organisation. O  - OptimisationIntegration in marketing and communication refers not only to interactivity but also to theoptimisation of messages to stakeholders to communicate coherently and transparently to achieve synergies and to encourage profitable relationships in the short-, medium-and long-term.N  - Necessity Integration in marketing and communication is not a new concept, but its necessity is more important than ever. More contact points, more specialised media, big data – to name but a few – provide better insight for purposeful, personalised interactions. Competition has increased, and customers are more valuable but are also more influential.Integration is part of the vocabulary of most marketers and communicators, but it is very often used casually.It's not about content marketing, it's about integration.— Adam Horne (@realadamhorne) August 7, 2019Next time you use that 11-letter word, consider reflecting earnestly on the acrostic of I-N-T-E-G-R-A-T-I-O-N: involvement, neutrality, teamwork, engagement, goal-directed, resource commitment, adaptation, total brand experience, interactivity, optimisation, necessity.
