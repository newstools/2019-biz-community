It’s a story where your ideas get bombed, a lot, but it’s also a story where once in a while, by some miracle, you come up with an idea worthy of a pretty shiny bird. And that makes all the late nights, impossible deadlines and constant rejection worthwhile. Success is 99% failure, and you have to go through a lot of that to find your Loerie.”The designs were judged on innovation, quality, relevance to the Loeries brand and to the Loeries audience who will wear them, as well as to the mediums they will appear on. In all, 57 entries were received and can be viewed on Instagram at #loeriesbarrondesignCCO of TBWA/Hunt/Lascaris Johannesburg and Chairperson of the Creative Circle, Peter Khoury, offered a definitive overall directive to the judging panel, “We are looking for iconic visuals.”  The panel included Jineil Kandasamy, Grid Worldwide Creative Director and Partner; Kyle Light, Designer at FCB; Musa Ndlovu, Barron Marketing and Communications Manager; Mike Salomon, Chief Commercial Officer at Barron; Laurence Horwitz, founder of Mama agency; Loeries CEO Andrew Human, and Vanessa von Broemsen.“Both designs are true to Loeries values and speak directly to the Loeries 2019 theme of telling better stories,” said Khoury. “The mouth is so emotional. A functional, awesome illustration that really shows how much heart and guts it takes before truthful and insightful stories can emerge. The other shows the truth of how many ideas get bombed before a great one comes along that is worthy of a Loeries Award. The two winners are designs that people will want to wear long past the event, they have some some street cred to them.”“The concept behind my illustration was inspired by the Loeries campaign line ‘Tell better Stories’,” explains Williams. “We all know that the best stories come from real life; from your heart.  My illustration serves as a reminder to 'tell stories with heart'. The wide open mouth becomes a speech bubble and inside that is a heart.  I entered two pieces and I was ecstatic when I heard the news that one of my illustrations was chosen as a winner. I have just had my first exhibition and this win puts my art out there even more.” Salomon and Ndlovu were united in their delight at the quality of the designs received for the competition, “Barron is inspired by innovation and creativity, we have been Switching Africa’s favourite brands ON through our extensive Product Media offering for over 29 years. As sponsors of the Media Innovation category at this year’s Loeries, we’re thrilled with what we’ve seen. The Media Innovation category focus is specifically on Product Media and approaches to advertising and it is exactly what the competition delivered. We cannot wait to print the two winning design onto the 2019 Loeries official T-shirt and swag bag.” Both winners loved the thought that delegates from Africa, the Middle East and other parts of the world would be taking their work home with them. “I’m super excited that my design is going to be worn by some of the most creative minds in the industry,” said Von Broembsen whilst Williams “just can’t wait to see the swag bag tell stories with heart.” Loeries Creative Week 2019 takes place from 22 to 25 August in Durban.
