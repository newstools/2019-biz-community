The most memorable of the latter drew an avalanche of hate mail when I suggested that Buddy the boxer dog was past his sell-by date and that maybe they should put him down.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1702/381509-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Screengrabs from the ad." width="120" height="120">[Orchids & Onions] Yappy days for the woofers from an old Buddy...A sure way to get the attention of many soft suburban people for your marketing pitch is to go the cute route. This has worked very well for Toyota over the years, with Buddy the Boxer endearing himself to people across the country, which can have done the brand no harm at all...By Brendan Seery 28 Feb 2017An Orchid I never gave to FCB was for an ad they did about 15 years ago for the frumpy second-generation Camry.In the TV commercial, the car looked almost attractive. Anyone who can make a Camry look even halfway sexy is an advertising genius…Toyota’s legendary Hilux bakkie – the best-selling vehicle in the country – is the epitome of the brand and its values. And, in truth, Toyota and FCB would have to do no advertising at all and Hilux would still be tops, so powerful is its image.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/509066.jpg" alt="Did someone say 'meerkat'?

Toyota SA and old family friends launch bespoke limited-edition HiluxToyota SA has launched the next chapter in Toyota's GR product story - a bespoke limited-edition Hilux GR Sport - with a new television commercial from FCB Joburg, featuring old family friends...Issued by FCB Africa 29 Jul 2019Every five years or so, the company brings out a “tribute” model and the Legend 50 is a reminder that the Hilux is 50 years old.The latest ad produced by FCB is not one of the best Hilux ones, but it doesn’t need to be. It just needs to remind people that this bakkie is “tougherer” than the rest.An Orchid this week for Toyota and FCB Joburg for producing consistently effective, and uniquely South African, advertising.There’s been a wonderful Anglo-Australian advertising battle during the latest Ashes series.After the Aussies won the first Test match, Vegemite (the uniquely Oz spread) couldn’t resist crowing. Vegemite took out full-page ads in newspapers in Britain, smack in the middle of the cricket reports.The ad said: “G’day, news has reached Down Under that free jars of Marmite are being handed out at the Ashes to try to prove it tastes better than our Vegemite.”It went on: “You see, Vegemite is a far stronger taste, made of resilience and fortitude with a dash of cunning and guile.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1412/244561-120x120.jpg" alt="Spreading the beef with a new Twitter turf twar" width="120" height="120">Spreading the beef with a new Twitter turf twarBovril and Marmite are two of the best-known dark brown spreads. Some sneer at the saltiness, others love to spread it on their toast and gulp down as more-ish hot drinks. Now things have entered the social media space, with #BattleOfTheSpreads taking off on Twitter...By Leigh Andrews 3 Dec 2014In a nod to Steve Smith’s heroic performance, it went on: “Vegemite tastes like back-to-back tons on your return Test. Vegemite tastes like a come-from-behind victory by 251 runs.”Rubbing Vegemite into the wounds, it concluded: “You lot won’t like the taste of Vegemite. Because Vegemite tastes like Australia. Catch ya at Lord’s.”The Brits, being the Brits and having invented dry humour, sent back what was must count as one of advertising’s all-time great “burns”.In a similar full-page ad, Marmite (the British equivalent), said: 'Dear Vegemite, We might not taste like Australia, but love it or hate it, we won’t be tampering with it. See you at the home of cricket. #MarmyArmy'. The barb was a reference to the Australian cricket team’s being caught cheating by tampering with the ball in SA.Apart from an Orchid nod to both ad teams, I must say that Marmite hit this one for six.But it once again makes me sad we don’t allow comparative advertising in this country. Both ads would have been banned here…
