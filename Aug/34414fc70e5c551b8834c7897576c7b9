How do you feel about it?Thank you. It’s a mix of genuine excitement and a dollop of trepidation when coming to grips with the responsibility of the role..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us more about the role and what you’re most looking forward to.The role has me accountable for the marketing activity across all the Liberty business units, including Liberty corporate and Stanlib. Additionally, the communications and corporate citizenry divisions also fall within this remit. Further, it is an exco appointment, so this sees me contributing to the greater business goals in a meaningful and substantive way.I think I’m most looking forward to the magic that can come when the integration of our marketing message to our social messaging come together in a seamless fashion. I believe that this will elevate our purpose in a way that will truly dramatise why we exist..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why are you excited to join Liberty?Mine is a personal reason. My father committed suicide when I was just 11. The brand was with my mother through what was her most vulnerable time, at a time when the financial sector didn’t deem black customers as a priority and therefore had extremely low trust levels within the demographic. They did the right thing and therefore emblazoned themselves on my psyche. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about your career in general and marketing in particular?The variation I’ve enjoyed. I’ve worked in many different sectors and therefore gained a much fuller perspective of the customer point of view. Nothing worse than a marketer who markets to themselves. And it is this constant learning and stretch that keeps me connected to the profession.[MY TOP 10 AT 10] @LibertyGroupSA’s Chief Marketing Officer, Thabang Ramogase joins @tboseZA for today’s #MyTop10At10 #TheBestTInTheCity pic.twitter.com/x2jBsx9EOa— Kaya FM Music (@KayaFMMusic) July 18, 2019.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us a bit about your experience.I started my working life as a number cruncher at Merrill Lynch, but quickly realised that the spreadsheet was not my friend! While I have no aversion for the numbers, I’m far more giddy about consumer behaviour. I’ve since worked for National Brands (now AVI) on brands like Willards Cheese Curls, Cheese Naks and Big Korn Bites; The Coca-Cola Company on Sprite, Schweppes Sparkling Granadilla, Lemon Twist and Dr Pepper; MTN; Nando’s; Afgri; and recently as CEO from Mindshare.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1207/106843-120x120.jpg" alt="The brains behind the daring Nando's ads" width="120" height="120">The brains behind the daring Nando's adsYou would not associate Thabang Ramogase with the controversial and light-hearted fast food chain Nando's adverts.By Zenoyise John 2 Jul 2012.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any other career highlights you’re particularly proud of?That would be the launch of Sprite Zero without question! The brand was formerly Diet Sprite and my boss at the time, Harmon Keith allowed me the latitude to experiment with a name that very few in the system thought made sense. South Africa and Greece were the first to use the zero nomenclature for zero sugary drinks and the rest, as they say, is history..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s at the top of your to-do list (at work)?Getting to know the team. Getting to understand the product..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you currently reading/watching/listening to for work?Eating the Big Fish by Adam Morgan. A third re-read I might add..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us something about yourself not generally known?I’m an introvert. The jobs and roles I’ve taken up have had me stretch into the extrovert territory and therefore made me a more whole human. But, my go-to energy recovery mode is solitude.You can stay up to date with Ramogase and Liberty by following the company on social media: Facebook | Twitter | LinkedIn.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
