She was an English teacher until the age of 35, when she decided to live her dream of being an artist. She began making crafts from her home in Cape Town in 1989 with an aim to combine sculpture with functionality. Her designs drew inspiration from both the human form and the beauty of nature, and her love of Africa was clearly evident in her work. Carrol Boyes products are available throughout South Africa, and in over 30 other countries around the world. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511770.jpg" alt="SA design icon Carrol Boyes dies" width="620" height="294">"Carrol demonstrated the very highest values in her business; integrity, playful perspectives and passion for design and for her staff. Her personal touch will inspire and stay with us always," says a statement released by her company."Carrol enriched many lives in multiple ways. She instilled an unconventional approach to business and her message to her staff was 'I have had such fun with you and you have enriched my life greatly. Please remember that we do things differently here. Never be ordinary - be extraordinary and throw in a bit of naughtiness every now and then and keep laughing. Never lose your sense of humour.â€™""Carrol will be remembered for her love, her story and her quirky creativity. Carrol leaves our nation with a legacy of excellence, unity, empowerment and pioneering functional art. She will be greatly missed," the statement ends.Rest in peace Carrol Boyes, and condolences to her family, friends and colleagues.
