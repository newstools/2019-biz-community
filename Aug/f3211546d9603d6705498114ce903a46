“The digital environment is constantly influenced by changing trends and global forces that define how we interact with our clients and respond to competition within our industry. Therefore the approach was to look at the sentiments towards DOOH and the digital transformation to see what future digitals or locations we had in the pipeline that we could convert or build. Thus the 4 new builds came into play namely Craighall, Peter Place, Upper Loop and M5 Garlandale all located in Cape Town and Johannesburg,” says Michael Brits, Development Manager at Tractor Outdoor. Tractor selected key sites within their portfolio for digital conversion and other new sites have been selected based on location or through various client interaction discussions to determine where sites would be received well. Their digital sites are placed at key points, either focusing on mass urbanisation, entertainment or transportation routes.  One of Tractor’s 2019 goals is the development and growth of their DOOH presence in the market and to be a leader in this space, and they are making strides achieving this. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511938-625x416.jpg" alt="The completed installation of Craighall digital via Jan Smuts Avenue." width="625" height="416">The completed installation of Craighall digital via Jan Smuts Avenue.DOOH worldwide has been increasing year on year, according to a global digital out of home advertising expenditure forecast by Statista based on a advertising market size from 2017 to 2027 they projected that there would be an increase of 6.7 billion in ad spend from 2019 to 15.9 billion in 2027.
