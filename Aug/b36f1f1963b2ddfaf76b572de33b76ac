Sometimes brands that are speaking to women speak at us and not to us. They assume they understand what the South African woman wants to hear. The GRL PWR Production agency aims to bridge that gap between brands and women dialogues. We want to contribute in creating creative platforms and conversations around South African women, find them where they are and give them spaces where they can authentically connect, create and be empowered.We want to work with brands that want to drive their focus in South African women conversations and GRL PWR Production agency aims to be the agent of change in how these brands and companies connect with South African women. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is GRL PWR Production’s competitive advantage?

Start with the people around you. Sometimes we overlook testing our businesses or ideas with the people around us. We all have a network of talented and successful people in each of our circles that can help or connect us with the right people. It’s all about opening yourself up and tapping into those spaces. Start where you are with what you have. The key is starting.Follow Voster on Twitter and Instagram or @grlpwrproduction on Instagram and the GRL PWR Series on Twitter and Facebook.blockquote{margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px;}setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
