We just have to get over our fears.” Publishing Your Inner Game: 12 Principles for High-Impact Entrepreneurs, was another medium to share these stories and continue to motivate both aspiring entrepreneurs and existing business owners. “Everything we do is about scale – we want to reach millions of people around the world. We want to change lives,” says Matt. It’s for this reason that the book is available as a free download on Amazon. “Lessons are there to be shared. The entrepreneurs I have interviewed want to help others like them succeed – they want to motivate and inspire action. That’s what we’re doing.” Discover the secret to entrepreneurial success 98% of businesses fail in their first ten years. Of the 2% that survive, only a fraction of them achieve high-impact growth. What’s their secret? This is what Matt set out to answer in Your Inner Game, sharing 12 Inner Game Principles that he has developed, both as an entrepreneur and based on the hundreds of people he has interviewed. Each chapter shares an entrepreneur’s story, unpacks lessons and then positions the Inner Game Principle that is the framework behind the insights presented. Thoughtful, honest and willing to reveal both the highs and lows of entrepreneurship, Matt takes his readers on a journey that will give them the blueprint to relook at everything they thought they knew about business To download your free copy of Your Inner Game, click here: http://www.mattbrownshow.com/ebook
