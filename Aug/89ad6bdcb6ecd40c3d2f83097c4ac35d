Image via Al Nicoll © via Gallo Images.Azania Mosaka chaired the popular panel, saying the latest Dove ad really stirred something inside her as a female and a mother. She shared that she was shy growing up and didn’t socialise much.She loved sticking posters on her wall but hated the gap in her teeth as she saw perfect smiles in all the posters of stars she admired. Short of surgery and braces, there’s nothing else she could do as she came from a Soweto household supporting three children on a single nursing salary.Not only did she not see people who looked like her in media and advertising, she didn’t see anyone who had made a success of it. While she’s among the posterchildren for success today, she counts the likes of gap-toothed Lawrence Fishburne, Eddie Murphy and our own Anele Mdoda as gap-toothed role models today.That’s why the Dove #ShowUs ad hit home for her, as it’s about the representation of women in all our varieties. Panellist and Dove ambassador Elle-Rose said Azania’s story hit home in that she didn’t see any trans women growing up.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1802/427796-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cox of the February 2018 cover of Cosmo SA - now trending everywhere!" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: #SayYesToLove with Cosmo SA's Laverne Cox cover exclusive!Social media netizens celebrated Cosmopolitan South Africa's decision to place Laverne Cox on the cover, with their logo suitably rainbow-hued to show support of the LGBTQI+ community...By Leigh Andrews 5 Feb 2018She feels a campaign like #ShowUs would have helped her feel like there was a place for her in the world if she’d seen it growing up.The Dove #ShowUs campaignKhanyi Mpumlwana of FCB represented the advertising industry on the panel and spoke of the need for creatives to foster a culture of accountability. She acknowledges that it’s hard to convince an entire industry that’s been doing something a certain way for many years to suddenly do things the right way, but we all need to do our bit.From the client side we heard from Sphelele Mjadu, Unilever Personal Care Senior Public Relations Manager for Africa, who said the #ShowUs campaign is two years in the making.It comes from the need to understand that the unrealistic beauty stereotypes we portray have a negative impact all round, and a huge level of potential as you can’t be what you can’t see.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/445131-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The first ever #MoreLikeMe Cannes Lions attendees." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Why you'll see #MoreLikeMe from #CannesLions2018Diversity is good for business, especially creative business, so little wonder that diversity is an increasingly hot topic at Cannes.

Her family thought this sweet but hearing it made her heart sink as she didn’t see darker and bigger females in the industry. ”A girl like me”: Reclassifying the standard of beauty and successShe went on to attend a multiracial private school where skinny was the norm. Explaining what that did to her outlook and ability to attain success, Mjadu admits it had a huge impact as she just didn’t view herself as beautiful, which affected her self-confidence and attaining her full potential as she felt she wasn’t ‘the standard’ everyone looked up to. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/510766-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Unstereotype Alliance: The problem is not seeing the problem." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: Welcome UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance SA chapter!This Women's Day in SA, we welcomed news that the Loeries has joined forces with UN Women's Unstereotype Alliance initiative, to launch its South Africa chapter, set to use the advertising industry as a force for good to drive positive change all over the world...By Leigh Andrews 9 Aug 2019Mpumlwana shared the stats that if a female CEO tells a joke, it’s 80% less likely to be well-received than if a male told it, even if she’s a brilliant storyteller. The message was hitting home hard for masterclass attendees by now, but there was more to come. Next to speak was Asanda Sizani, originally from the Eastern Cape, who remembers the first time she bought a magazine with her own money, as there was “a girl like me” on the cover of the international glossy.

The majority of what they see in the media and advertising are unrealistic. That’s where UN Women and Dove are trying to change the picture. They stand for not letting anyone feel they are less than anyone else, or that they should be anything other than their own best self. A lot of that is to do with what’s fed into your self-esteem.The #Unstereotype AllianceIt’s about setting global standards everywhere.

In doing so, females owned the story and spoke on their own behalf.
