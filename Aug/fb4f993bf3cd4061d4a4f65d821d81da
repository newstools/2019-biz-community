What channels should you focus on? What kind of content should you send out on those channels? And how frequently should you be communicating with your customers? While a lot depends on the nature of the business and what it’s trying to achieve, there are a few basic things every business can do to ensure that its communication strategy is as effective as possible. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497844-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The power of retargeting: How to move customers from wanting what you offer to needing it" width="120" height="120">The power of retargeting: How to move customers from wanting what you offer to needing itIf you are not yet doing retargeting for your business, you are clearly missing out on a key step in the decision-making process. Here's a quick overview...By Kyle Warmback 22 May 2019Start with your existing customersUltimately, the best place for any small and emerging business – to start when it comes to customer communication – is with its existing customers. After all, they’re the ones who’ve already shown an interest in what you’re selling. It shouldn’t be that difficult to make them a part of your growth story. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496922.jpg" alt="How to hyper-personalise your digital communications" width="120" height="120">How to hyper-personalise your digital communicationsThere was a time, not all that long ago, when personalising digital communications simply meant addressing your customers by name...By Ross Sibbald 16 May 2019There’s a lot more to be gained by engaging with loyal, existing customers too. Research shows that the probability of selling to an existing customer is 60 to 70%. By contrast, the probability of selling to a new potential customer is just five to 20%. Even more significantly, 80% of a business’s future profits will come from just 20% of its existing customers.It’s also worth noting that it can cost five times as much to acquire a new customer as it does to retain an existing one.Make it worthwhileOf course, if you want to build up a database (even if it only includes your existing customers) – you have to make it worthwhile. In most cases, that means establishing a loyalty programme. Today’s technology means that it’s easier than ever to build these programmes and get customer details as well as information about what they’re purchasing. Used effectively, this data can help bring new levels of personalisation to your customer communication – increasing its effectiveness. But data-driven personalisation alone isn’t enough. Your communication still has to be relevant, look good and engage meaningfully with everyone who sees it.Right communication, right channel That means a business can’t simply provide its customers with discounts and offers. It needs to work seriously on ensuring that its most loyal customers are included in their growth story. Examples of how to do this include sending out communications detailing new product offerings and locations, profiling new high-performing staff members and any relevant customer case studies.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/505932-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Want your customers to trust you?

There’s no greater value than to be able to engage with your customers on a human level. Getting the right balance takes time and careful analysis of all the available data. But it’s also pivotal that SMEs focus their efforts on the right channels. Given their limited resources, SMEs simply can’t afford to go all out on every channel available to them. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504890.jpg" alt="Drive consumer behaviour by addressing the entire supply chain" width="120" height="120">Drive consumer behaviour by addressing the entire supply chainChanging consumer behaviour and creating loyalty throughout the supply chain are areas every FMCG manufacturer is trying to achieve...By Jaco Saunders 3 Jul 2019When it comes to personalised offers, for example, they’re far more likely to get a response with an SMS than an email.Research shows that 98% of all SMSes are opened and that, on average, it takes someone 90 seconds to respond to an SMS versus 20 and 90 minutes for email. But an ordinary SMS can only do so much. Using Smart SMS technology, you can effectively use the number of characters that make up your SMS as a subject line, before leading your customers their personalised landing page with content that’s unique to the individual customer.          View this post on Instagram           When your 3 year old daughter tries to help you reach your goal for your Scrapbooking business. .

This applies as much to how it uses customer communication channels as it does to any other aspect of the business. It’s imperative, therefore, that businesses stay willing to learn throughout every part of their journey.
