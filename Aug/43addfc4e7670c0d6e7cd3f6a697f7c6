A typical day starts with going through any urgent emails, prepping and planning for upcoming meetings and checking in with all team members to make sure all milestones and deadlines are on track. After prep and planning, 70% of my day will be about attending meetings with the team, clients and/or CEOs; providing mentorship and guidance to any high risks or issues that have been brought to my attention. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What did you want to be when you grew up? All I knew was that I wanted to help people, and thankfully I find that I am doing this by providing mentorship and guidance to all..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How did you get into the tech space? I took a leap of faith. I received a job opportunity in my late 20s to become an information technology project administrator. The company chose me even though I didn't have tech experience. I gained all of my tech experience in this particular role. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What was the best advice anyone ever gave you? One needs to create a plan for your dreams. Set milestones every year and live life to the fullest to achieve them - it's about having the tenacity to never give up. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What advice do you have for the future generation of women wanting to get into the tech space?Do not undervalue yourself and never think you aren't good enough. Women have a sixth sense which is an awesome and invaluable addition to the tech space. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Who or what is your biggest motivation? My internal drive is my biggest motivator. Being able to connect with people daily and to constantly solve problems is a massive driver. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Are South African women getting enough of a chance to shine in the tech industry? Personally, I believe there is room to grow. In the US they drive women in the tech space. I previously worked for Dell EMC and I was celebrated for being a woman. South Africa doesn't have the same focus on women in tech as the US, but it's growing and I'm hopeful that with initiatives like 'Inspiring Fifty' will provide more exposure..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}As a female business leader, what’s the least and most exciting aspect of your workday? The most exciting is to see new portals being developed to solve problems, such as the work Basalt does with Tech Relief. I love to also see new innovative ideas arising from team members. My workday is always exciting, I can't think of one boring item!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Women are considered to be natural problem solvers. Why do you think this is perfect for the tech industry? It is so essential to be able to solve problems in technology. I believe that women have a sixth sense and look at things from a different perspective - this makes for more innovative tech products and software developments..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Could you list a few, if any, specific challenges females face in this industry? Women are often perceived as being too soft. I was once told by my business unit manager that he didn't think I had the 'balls' to manage a certain project as he perceived me as being too soft. Needless to say, I excelled in this particular project management role for three years as the client kept on asking for me to be on the project..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is your advice for overcoming these challenges?Never back down. When someone thinks you are lacking in a certain area, dig deep and prove them wrong. Take negative advice/criticism and turn it into your biggest accomplishment..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}You were recently nominated as one of the InspiringFiftySA top women. How do you feel about being recognised for this? It's such an honour to stand next to women that are passionate about their careers in STEM. It opens doors for me to meet and get to know women in the field of technology, science and engineering. It also opens avenues for young women to get in touch with me, in order for me to further assist them in pursuing their passions and careers in the tech industry.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
