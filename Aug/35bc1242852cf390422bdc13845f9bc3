Jos CaelersThe Engagement Factory leadership team started the process of creating their new brand strategy by speaking to clients and conducting interactive workshop sessions with staff and partners from across various disciplines within the business. Using feedback from these forums, key differentiators of the business and its future direction and ambitions to create the new brand strategy had evolved. Says Jos Caelers, CEO of Engagement Factory: “At this point in EF’s journey, almost six years since being established, there was a need to articulate a unified brand proposition and strategy – born out of our history but also fit for the future vision of EF. There was considerable work done in gaining a better understanding of what our creative and strategic offering means to clients, team members and partners alike. This has resulted in what we feel is a really strong strategy and positioning, which the entire team has been involved in creating. We have not reinvented the wheel, this isn’t a rebrand or a change in direction either. What we have been able to do us refine to its core why clients, future or current, would want to work with EF. We have concentrated on what is fundamental to our business. It means ensuring that every element of our approach and what we produce, works towards ensuring that our clients ambitions are fully achieved. We also wanted to give prominence to the values that make EF who we are.” The creative team at EF also used their new direction to adapt the agency’s brand identity to better reflect where the business is now on its journey and where it aims to be in future. In the age of digitisation, EF is fervent about developing creativity that people want to spend time with and always thinking about emotional attachments between the brands they represent and their consumers. EF’s tone can be defined as bold, contemporary, striking and simple. It boasts versatility that never tires. Please visit www.engagementfactory.com.
