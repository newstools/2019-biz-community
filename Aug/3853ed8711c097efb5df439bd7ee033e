List a few pain points the industry can improve on. It will change from person to person, but I think personally, it’s the mentality of the people in it. I always believe there’s a place in this world for us all to shine. There’s no need to be competitive (I’m not talking about a healthy competition) or to get rude with your peers, what’s meant for you will always be for you. I wish more of us would support one another in a genuine way, instead of trying to only boost ourselves. 10. What are you working on right now? I’m now a news and traffic reporter for Good Hope FM.         View this post on Instagram           Did you hear?

Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself.

It’s honestly not as easy as you think it is and it’s not as glamorous as it looks.  But if it’s something you truly want to do, go for it. If you never try, you’ll never know. Simple as that.
