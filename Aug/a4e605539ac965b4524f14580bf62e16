To make the platform as consumer-centric as possible, Techsys housed the platform on both USSD and WhatsApp channels, giving the public the choice to decide for themselves how they wished to interact. This approach allowed the platform to be accessible across consumer income groups, since WhatsApp is highly cost-effective in terms of data usage, whereas USSD lines can be accessed from feature phones. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/512747-625x351.jpg" alt="Laduma! Techsys Digital and Tafel Lager create a WhatsApp win for soccer fans" width="625" height="351">And interact they did! Tafel motivated consumers to engage by rewarding them with instant prizes, like airtime. The campaign made use of the functionality that WhatsApp provides, such as the ability to seamlessly exchange videos.  By sending through a video demonstrating how you show support for your Namibian team, consumers were entered into the Grand Prize Draw. To up the ante even more, the campaign lines encouraged consumers to predict game scores.  Close predictions were rewarded with instant prizes, and soccer fans became even more invested in The Beautiful Game. The campaign exceeded the consumer acquisition target by over 260%, with the average consumer interacting 24 times â€“ needless to say, consumers were engaged with the campaign. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/512748-625x246.jpg" alt="Laduma!
