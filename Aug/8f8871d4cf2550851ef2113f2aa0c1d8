The Beaded Billboard for Toyota Corolla was awarded four times with three Silvers and a Bronze, and the Toyota Get Out of the City – Boys Night, Couples Night, Friday Night entry in the Radio & Audio Radio Station Commercials category received a Campaign Bronze. Celebrating the agency’s wins, Chief Creative Officer Ahmed Tilly praised the creative leads on the projects –Suhana Gordhan (Coca-Cola) and Tian van den Heever (Toyota), the creative teams they worked and everyone at the agency who had a hand in seeing the three exceptional campaigns come to life. “The Phonetic Can and Beaded Billboard in particular were essentially simple but very powerful ideas. However, it required a great deal of detailed research, precise production and carefully-timed logistics to see them come to life. That means almost everyone at the agency played a role in their creation, and I’m so proud of them all,” he said. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513888-625x417.jpg" alt="FCB Joburg wins at Loeries 2019 for Coca-Cola SA, Toyota SA" width="625" height="417">The full list of FCB Joburg’s awards is:  Campaign Gold in the Integrated Campaign category for Coca-Cola The Phonetic Can  Campaign Bronze in the PR & Media Communication Campaign category for Coca-Cola The Phonetic Can Campaign Bronze in the Radio & Audio Radio Station Commercials category for Toyota Get Out of the City – Boys Night, Couples Night, Friday Night Campaign Bronze in the Film Communication Branded Content category for Coca-Cola The Phonetic Can ‘Share a Sound’ sound guide Silver in the Media Innovation Single Medium category for Coca-Cola The Phonetic Can Silver in the Graphic Design Package Design category for Coca-Cola The Phonetic Can Silver in the Out of Home Direct Mail Design category for Coca-Cola The Phonetic Can Silver in the Out of Home Outdoor Media Design category for Toyota Corolla Beaded Billboard Bronze in the Film Communication TVC & Cinema above 90s for Toyota Start your Impossible Bronze in the Media Innovation Single Medium category for Toyota Corolla Beaded Billboard For more:Bizcommunity search: Loeries Creative Week DurbanGoogle news search: LoeriesTwitter search: LoeriesOfficial site: www.loeries.com, Facebook, Twitter, InstagramMore info: Creative Week Durban overview
