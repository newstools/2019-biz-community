More curries, stews, soups and an unapologetically large amount of red wine. This oxtail curry potjie was served with a delicious @lozarnwines 2016 Shiraz. Ok not a, but rather a few bottles. The peppery Shiraz was perfectly paired with the spicy, slightly sweet curry. A great start to winter. #winter #feast #food #local #dinner #lunch #comfortfood #bbq #braai #beef #curry #fire #hungry #lifestyleblogger #hungry #lifestyle #capetown #southafrica #eating #wine #sipping #tasting #cheersA post shared by  Clement Pedro - MANCRAVE (@clement.pedro.mancrave) on Apr 1, 2019 at 2:12am PDTSitole is an acclaimed magazine food stylist and cooking TV show host, and author of several cookbooks showcasing the flavours of Africa, including Recipes with A Touch of Africa, Cape to Cairo and Cooking from Cape to Cairo.Montali is best known for her 15-year tenure at Food & Home Entertaining magazine, where she was food and deputy editor.
