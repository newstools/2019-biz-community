<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/514045.jpg" alt="365 Digital and OLX join forces to drive better results for advertisers" width="250" height="166">The OLX Group is the fourth largest publisher in the world, operating a network of market-leading trading platforms in over 40 countries and powered by a team of 5000, all united under the single mission to "make it super easy for people to buy and sell almost anything, promoting prosperity in local communities." This mission together with the 2.5 million South Africans that pass through OLX every month presents a goldmine to advertisers: a wealth of purchase intent data. In other words, brands can design messaging right across the purchase journey. In the context of the South African market, classifieds are often niggled by safety concerns. Fortunately, OLX has positioned itself away from this stigma through its robust registration process for both buyer and seller. By the same token, OLX upholds high brand safety standards, which combined with 365 Digital’s network of advertisers means that only the top brands are matched to product context. Now a new homemaker looking for a pet-friendly place will get to know the best and latest dog food brands.  "We are very excited to partner with 365 Digital. With over two decades of experience in ad operations and media representation, 365 Digital will support the growing classifieds product and tech company by providing world-class service,” says Mark Kritzinger, OLX country manager for South Africa. Mark adds, “We have already built a great working relationship with the team. The partnership allows a seamless integration with our system and gives us the opportunity to operate in a highly collaborative manner. We are pleased that our inventory joins an already strong portfolio of publishers, and a powerful commercial team with strong relationships.” Julian Jordaan, Commercial Director of 365 Digital, comments on the partnership, “We’re thrilled to be partnering OLX. The addition to 365 Digital’s already robust premium publisher marketplace is a perfect enhancement to premium campaigns not only in quality of inventory, but also scale and efficacy. There are very few publishers that have the capability and brands solutions that OLX has; such as their in-market purchase intent data and the dynamic rich-media creative solutions.”The joint forces of OLX, a premium marketplace for consumers and 365, a premium marketplace for advertisers, is a welcome boost for digital marketing in South Africa where data quality and brand safety are on the tip of everyone’s tongue.
