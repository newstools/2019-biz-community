Agency CEO and founder Monalisa Sibongile Zwambila shared, “As the shift in focus and budgets towards public relations has grown in recent times, we’ve seen a spike in the number of integrated agencies pitching for and winning public relations campaign work.” She continued, “Sasol partnered with us based on our content development competency across all disciplines. We were also able to demonstrate our strategic skills, and our ability to take advantage of tactical time-sensitive opportunities. The Riverbed team is proud to partner with the Group’s Communication and Brand Management function, especially for a brand that is so deeply rooted in South Africa’s heritage.
