Her parents would relocate to Lagos, Nigeria, when she was seven, which gave her the opportunity to spend time with her grandparents who lived on a cocoa farm in Ondo State. While visiting, she would learn about Nigerian culture, building a foundation for her later career decision.“As a continent, Africa has remained creatively silent for centuries. Our stories are seldom told outside our families and villages and often from the perspective of ‘someone’ looking in,” she said.A calamity befell her at age 11 when her father suddenly passed away. A year later she would move back to London where she received education at Hammersmith County Secondary School and later at the Ridgeway School in Kent, under local guardian care in Turnbridge Wells. Her dream lived on.Media careerHer road to a media career started with a brief modelling stint while completing her Master’s degree in Human Resource Management at the University of Westminster in London. After that, in the 1980s, she became a recruitment consultant in the UK and would stay in the human resources corporate field through to the 2000s when she decided to make a career switch from HR to media in her 40s.Abudu had decided to go it alone and establish her own human resources development company, called Vic Lawrence & Associates Limited (VLA) in 1993, which provided human resources related solutions for businesses in Nigeria. The company had grown and built enviable expertise in areas including learning, training and development, outsourcing, strategy and business support. Her company had clients in oil and gas, banking and finance, healthcare and government parastatals.Mo the media proprietorIn 2008, Abudu started out as executive producer and host of her television talk show, Moments with Mo.

With her show she covered a cross-section of topics including lifestyle, health, culture, politics and entertainment, contributing richly to the development of African discourse.By 2013, Abudu had made up her mind, she was handing over the baton to young Nigerian women to host the show, took a plunge and took her investments to launch EbonyLife TV, the channel owned by her company EbonyLife Media, making it Africa’s first global black entertainment and lifestyle network that aims to narrate African stories on global platforms.She oversees five divisions at EbonyLife Media: EbonyLife TV, EbonyLife Films, EbonyLife ON, EbonyLife Studios and EbonyLife Productions Limited (UK).
