Hot Cares is the Hot 91.9FM community upliftment initiative that strives towards making a meaningful difference in the lives of those around us. Since 2015, Hot Cares has provided much-needed assistance to those in need within our community. With this in mind, FIBO Africa’s chosen beneficiary which will be supported by Hot Cares for 2019 is Fight with Insight. Established in the inner city with the vision of creating a safe place for the children of Johannesburg, Fight with Insight uses boxing to teach them life skills that assist them in taking responsibility for claiming their rights. Fight With Insight aims to provide a mindful boxing programme to children and youth at risk; to provide a follow-on intervention in the form of boxing classes for youth and children in conflict with the law; to provide a life skills programme to all children who attend the boxing programme and to provide a mentorship programme to youth who are in need of opportunities to gain further education, employment skills and employment. Fitness has the power to change lives. Be part of the movement. The details: Date: 25 October 2019Venue: Ticketpro DomeTime: 12h00Cost: R4,000 excl.
