More brands advertising means more content, more messages, more products and services screaming for your consumer’s attention.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/505955-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Digital marketing in a third world country" width="120" height="120">Digital marketing in a third world countryAs a third world country, traditional media is our main method of communication with radio, television and OOH the highest consumed mediums across various markets in South Africa.

I want to do and say the right thing to ensure I get the attention of that person and make a lasting impact.We see this happening daily in advertising – brands are no longer telling us what we like, but rather ads are engaging with us on a more personal level every day – and we prefer it!<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497844-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The power of retargeting: How to move customers from wanting what you offer to needing it" width="120" height="120">The power of retargeting: How to move customers from wanting what you offer to needing itIf you are not yet doing retargeting for your business, you are clearly missing out on a key step in the decision-making process. Here's a quick overview...By Kyle Warmback 22 May 2019Brands are craving feedback to better themselves and their products/services. As digital marketers (all marketers in fact), we have acknowledged that it is time to move away from ‘lazy’ advertising and advocate for more compelling ads. Consumers are not buying the act anymore and it’s reflecting in campaign performances.Consumers want to be enticed, intrigued and entertained by ads or they won’t be influenced by it. Brands that are getting this right, are essentially winning this race.Lookalike audiences What we’re also seeing is the shift from brands using social media mainly for bottom of the funnel objectives, like conversions and leads to more intentional brand awareness campaigns. I’m not saying that social media isn’t good for conversions, it is. But just because we can serve a lead to a consumer we have not engaged with first, does not mean we should – or shouldn't anymore.Is it smart marketing to be blinded only by hard metrics over foundation metrics that drive long-term brand growth? Do we let our clients dictate what our strategies should look like? As agencies, we need to put together robust media strategies that combined with exceptional creative gives our clients the best shot at influencing their consumer in the right environment.We should always be working on our target audience; who we’re speaking to, when and how. Facebook and Instagram are great for finding potential clients/customers with features like lookalike audiences, especially for bottom of the funnel campaigns.But are we using them in the right campaigns? Are lookalike audiences still as valuable as they were before? Or has the constant flooding of ads to a consumer resulted in low performance?I believe in the potential of lookalike audiences when used with the right message against the right objective and when it is based on a verified source. So perhaps we should only use existing consumers/clients to create lookalikes when finding new customers for accuracy? And even if we are, are we testing and optimising to get better performing campaigns?         View this post on Instagram           Oh my, the magic of Facebook. One of their most amazing features are what’s called “look alike” audiences. Let me explain… Just yesterday, I met with a client running a Facebook campaign. It’s working well but it could work better. It can work better by uploading into Facebook not just his customer database - but his BIGGEST spenders. Then, based on that segment, he can create what’s called a 1% lookalike audience (essentially, Facebook will find the top 1% of the population most similar to his biggest spenders). You might be reading this email and thinking “I know all about look alikes”. And that’s great. But are you segmenting your biggest and best buyers? Probably not. And if not, you should. It’s a VERY high probability play. I'm looking for 5 companies that want help mapping out their social media content plan. If that's you, just say "yes" in the comments below and I'll message you all the details. #lookalikeaudiences #targetaudience #facebookmarketing #digitalstrategy #socialmediamanagement #onlinemarketing #businesstips #fubbi A post shared by  Fubbi.co (@fubbi.co) on May 7, 2019 at 10:04pm PDT Targeted campaigns, tactical marketing We can no longer be promoting content just for the sake of it and targeting people from our own biases. Brands that are only seeing digital media as a means to an end are competing with brands who are implementing targeted campaigns that drive affinity, that measure engagement as a KPI (because they see the value) and who will convert consumers with compelling creative after properly identifying them through tactical remarketing.Every campaign or strategy we plan boils down to objective. As marketers, we should be able to define correct objectives and strategies that can realistically meet these objectives. Whether you’re running a campaign focused on reach or conversions, they are both equally important and part of a bigger picture.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490211.jpg" alt="Data-led creativity: A marriage that won't separate brands and customers" width="120" height="120">Data-led creativity: A marriage that won't separate brands and customersToday, brands must start embracing data and draw insight from all available sources...By Charl van Rooyen 2 Apr 2019We need to move away from being fixated on action-type campaigns only and see the relevance of generating real brand affinity among our audience. Look at trends like influencer marketing and moves like Instagram removing like counts as indicators of where our strategies should be going.Let’s acknowledge that we are one of many brands speaking to the same consumer and that we need to ensure that when we’re seen we are also remembered. If marketers can achieve strong brand recall, it is one part of the challenge overcome.Let us be intentional with our marketing strategies and adaptable with our creative and message and let this set a strong foundation for our campaigns.
