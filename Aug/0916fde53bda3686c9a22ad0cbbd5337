The Awards take place on the last evening of the two-day event, October 29-30, 2019, in Cape Town. “Women-owned businesses are a vital part of our African economy and the women of Africa are our most valuable, untapped resource,” commented Irene Ochem, AWIEF founder and chief executive officer. “Each year the entries to the AWIEF Awards grow in number and this response signifies the importance of recognising and celebrating women in Africa for their achievements and contribution to Africa’s economic and sustainable development. “Women-owned businesses are growing on the continent and are a vital part of Africa’s future and seven out of 10 of the fastest growing economies in the world, are to be found in Africa. Africa is rising and we must make sure the women of the continent, the backbone of our communities and our families, are given the opportunities to rise as well,” said Ochem. Twenty-two women founders and entrepreneurs have been selected as finalists, from different African countries, across eight different categories. The AWIEF Awards’ panel of judges is made up of high-calibre industry experts and thought leaders spread across the continent. Birgitta Cederstrom, Frost & Sullivan's Business Development Director for MEA and this year's head judge for AWIEF, said: "The judging panel has had some very busy weeks where we reviewed over 200 shortlists for consideration and we are delighted to see the high standard and quality of entries coming through to AWIEF. This is one of the most robust and independent jury-based Awards programmes that currently is offered in Africa, and we are thrilled to support female entrepreneurs.”Awards event The AWIEF Awards winners will be announced at a gala dinner on 30 October 2019, following on from the 2019 AWIEF Conference and Exhibition taking place on 29-30 October 2019 at the Cape Town International Convention Centre, Cape Town.
