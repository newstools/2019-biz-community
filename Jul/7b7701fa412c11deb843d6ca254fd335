<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506991.jpg" alt="Reinvesting to ensure client convenience" width="625" height="625">This year, we can already boast with having added a purpose-built private deck to Gallagher 3 to ensure that guests have ample space allocated to enjoy their refreshments and lunch. Further improvement projects for this year include the complete refurbishment of the Hall 2 and Hall 3 bathroom facilities. We are also installing a water tank with the capacity of a million litres in order to avoid any water woes if the city is experiencing challenges. Make an appointment for a site visit with one of our friendly consultants to experience all the improvements that we are working on for the convenience of our clients.
