Day by day, we work to unlock the potential of African artists’ creativity by allowing them to live off their art by cooperating with them to fight music piracy.”Aizarani continued: “We are initially focused on East Africa. The music here amazed me and my team, and we genuinely believe that we can push it internationally. We’re here to stay and make a difference in the music game in Africa. We hope that Smubu becomes a home for all musicians emerging from Africa.”They may look towards Tanzania and Uganda next as the regions are experiencing a boom to the internet market, particularly in mobile network expansion.Source: NexTVAfrica.com.
