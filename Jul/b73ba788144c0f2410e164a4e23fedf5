The Titanium Awards recognises and celebrates healthcare professionals and businesses delivering superior services to the Southern African public and private healthcare sectors. The prize was awarded for a 2018 body of work presented in Hudson’s weekly Health and Wellness segment, featured on Lunch on CapeTalk. Segments which were celebrated include interviews and content around concussions, sleep, atopic dermatitis, palliative care for children, and the importance of access to pregnancy education amongst others.  “I share this accolade with my Lunch show colleagues, producer Amy-Rae Rispel and technical producer OB Sitwayi. We are deeply honoured for the acknowledgment of our work and our continued commitment to covering healthcare issues in an accessible and helpful way. I will continue to use my voice and platform to facilitate meaningful and empowering discourse that educates our audience,” said Pippa Hudson, CapeTalk host. “The award is testament to CapeTalk’s commitment to being a voice for the community and offering engaging information. We are thrilled for Pippa Hudson, Amy-Rae Rispel and OB Sitwayi and encourage new and long-time listeners to continue tuning into this award-winning show, weekdays from 1-to-3pm on CapeTalk 567AM,” said Tessa van Staden, programme manager, CapeTalk.
