This new feature from YouTube Music allows YouTube Premium and YouTube Music Premium subscribers to make the move between a song and its music video for uninterrupted listening and/or watching. With Smart Downloads, YouTube Music automatically saves music at night, when connected to Wi-Fi, helping music lovers to use less mobile data, enjoy a smoother updating experience and save up to 500 of their favourite songs offline using their Liked Songs playlist as well as other favourite playlists and albums.Previously, the Offline Mixtape feature could only download up to 100 songs – specifically chosen for them based on what they listened to and loved most on the platform. With Smart Downloads, users may select the number of songs they would like automatically downloaded by toggling their YouTube Music settings.This means YouTube Music Premium subscribers with Smart Downloads enabled on their mobile devices may now access hundreds of their favourite tracks regardless of connectivity. This feature is currently available on Android, with plans to bring it to iOS in the future.YouTube Music has also launched some playlists for South African users, which include:Top Tracks Top MzansiTop SA House Top SA Hip-Hop Top Afrikaans Top AmaPiano Top SA Gospel and Soul
