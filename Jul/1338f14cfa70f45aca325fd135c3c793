We’re excited to be partnering with Primedia to grow this brilliant annual event and boost the sport of cycling in South Africa.” “Last year, over 40% of 947 cycle race finishers were Vitality members – that’s nearly 10,000 adults out of a field of 25,000. We’re not only looking to build on the number of Vitality members we can get cycling, but how many others we can encourage to be active,” adds Bhorat. “Vitality has a global commitment to make 100 million people more physically active by 2025, and with that vision in mind, we’re expanding the race this year with a brand new 40 km route to make it accessible to those new to the sport cycling.”   <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/508591-625x160.jpg" alt="Call to cyclists to get moving and 'Ride Joburg' with Discovery and 947" width="625" height="160">Back by popular demand, the event returns with 2018’s flipped route that spans approximately 94.7km of thrilling Joburg terrain that cyclists get to own for a day. The challenge remains, but the spin on the ‘traditional’ route ensures that cyclists get the tough climbs out of the way while their legs are still fresh. Supported and hosted by the City of Joburg, cyclists will get to enjoy a safe ride with full road closures on the route.  The Discovery 947 Ride Joburg will be bigger and more inclusive than ever with the introduction of a shorter 40km route aimed at novice riders with the appetite to conquer the streets of Joburg at a distance that matches their fitness level.  Speaking from France, South African Road Champion and Stage 9 Tour de France Winner, Daryl Impey from Team Mitchelton–Scott, welcomed the Discovery 947 Ride Joburg announcement: “I’m really thrilled to hear about the news that Discovery is investing in our sport. Hope to see you all there and good luck!” The Discovery 947 Ride Joburg is the world’s second-largest timed cycling race that attracts thousands of cyclists, ranging from beginners to elite, every year. The popularity of the sport is further bolstered by the massive participation in the Mountain Bike and Kiddies rides that are held the weekend before Ride Joburg at Steyn City – the new home of the Discovery 947 Mountain Bike Ride and Discovery 947 Kiddies Ride.  Discovery Vitality members will be pleased to learn they will be able to earn 1100 Vitality points for the 94.7km Ride Joburg and 800 Vitality points for the new 40km route.  “We are thrilled to partner with Discovery on evolving this important cycling event.
