The presentation unpacked the world-wide top tactics used to increase leadership visibility and communication, which include the use of video as a tool to communicate to staff and bridging the gap between internal staff and the executives.“We need to think about how we can use technology to support internal communication," said Sukdeo, the Head of Television Broadcasting at Global Access. Video has been reported to be an effective tool to capture the attention of audiences. It is also important to put into consideration the audience’s attention span when they are consuming audio-visual content. She advised communicators to get to the point and say what they want to say, as quickly as possible.Sukdeo also touched on how it is vital that in order to improve communication within an organisation, a different approach needs to be employed by communicators with regards to the delivery of their content to their staff. Story-telling should be used as a method to share information. Good story-telling can elevate a conversation and keep employees engaged with the message being put across. “Organisations should also tell stories about issues that matter to employees beyond the office." Another important factor to note is that for internal staff to engage, they need to feel like they are a part of the conversation. She highlighted that leaders in the business should utilise communication tools to facilitate two-way communication between themselves and their employees. “Conversation is an exchange of ideas. Don’t listen to respond; listen to understand. Feedback is only useful if it changes company behaviour.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/509006-625x417.jpg" alt="Think forward to effective communication" width="625" height="417">Guest speaker Daniel Munslow elaborated on the idea of leaders building a strong reputation for themselves and their company by being honest in their communication. “Leaders need to be comfortable with having difficult conversations to build equity and to control the narrative.”To close off the conversation, founder and CEO of Development Communication Solutions, Mari Lee emphasised the need for communicators to set goals and objectives to be able to measure the ROI on their communication. The vacuum between staff and leadership can be filled by internal communicators asking the right questions which can ultimately influence employee behaviour.As a communication specialist, Global Access understands that communication creates alignment in an organisation.
