The desirable high-frequency site provides brands and advertisers with an average reach of just under 220,000 consumers monthly, which represents approximately 6.5% of the KZN adult population.“This is the next step in the growth of our digital network,” says Dumisani Malembe, Development Director at Outdoor Network. “Outdoor Network’s broader strategy is to provide brands and advertisers with a highly desirable national footprint in key, high-demand metropolitan areas, such as Pietermaritzburg.”Pietermaritzburg - the second-largest city in the province of KwaZulu-Natal- is an important regional industrial hub, producing aluminium, timber and dairy products, along with being the main economic hub of Umgungundlovu District Municipality. Centrally situated between Durban and Johannesburg, near the Drakensberg and several game reserves, Pietermaritzburg is a convenient stop-over and base from which to explore the KZN province, and a city that hosts some of the country's top sporting events, including the Comrades and Dusi Canoe marathons. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507685.jpg" alt="Outdoor Network unveils rotating digital site in Pietermaritzburg" width="470" height="300" rel="">click to enlarge<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507687.jpg" alt="Outdoor Network unveils rotating digital site in Pietermaritzburg" width="470" height="300" rel="">click to enlargePietermaritzburg is also well-populated with hotels, conference venues and tourist attractions, and is home to the area’s premier shopping destination – the large Liberty Midlands Mall.The inclusion of the Pietermaritzburg site in Outdoor Network’s expanding digital network is significant for brands seeking a cutting-edge platform delivering regional and national coverage.To find out how Outdoor Network’s roadside LED can help your brand deliver flexible, immediate and effective out-of-home campaigns nationally, contact info@on.co.zabRev('brev-6f74e9b0-74ff-44ee-9467-85ee4e4faec1', '>a/\<az.oc.no@ofni>"az.oc.no;46#&ofni:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').Follow Outdoor Network on Twitter @outdoornetsa, Facebook @OutdoorNetworkSA, on LinkedIn or visit www.on.co.za.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507689.jpg" alt="Outdoor Network unveils rotating digital site in Pietermaritzburg" width="470" height="300" rel="">click to enlarge<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507691.jpg" alt="Outdoor Network unveils rotating digital site in Pietermaritzburg" width="470" height="300" rel="">click to enlargeAbout Outdoor Network:Outdoor Network, a division of PMG, is one of the largest South African Out-of-Home media owners, offering national reach with a host of billboards and street furniture platforms.
