I would like to thank the Marketing Achievement Awards for their recognition of #Limitless. We strive to produce creative yet simple and impactful work for our clients – these awards are evidence of this. We would also like to thank Sasol for their support and will strive to continue to produce industry leading work going forward.”  The awards were established to celebrate excellence in the science and art of marketing and recognise successful marketing initiatives and thought leadership.“Sasol have been a partner of South African women’s football for over a decade. We thus wanted to create a campaign which took women’s football in South Africa to the next level, growing support for the game and, as a result, increasing positive sentiment for Sasol. #Limitless has managed to achieve just that. Its success over the past year, including this recognition, has been incredibly rewarding. We would like to acknowledge Levergy and the great work they have done on this campaign as well as SAFA for their continuous support of women’s football in SA. We look forward to achieving further great things together in the future,” added Nozipho Mbatha, Sasol Group Brand Marketing Manager.
