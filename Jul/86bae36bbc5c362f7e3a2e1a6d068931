But after 30 years in advertising, I’ve decided it's time to take a break and get involved in something new. I leave the creative product in the hugely capable hands of Tseliso Rangaka and Matt Barnes, alongside a deeply talented management team – so I have no doubt that the foundations that we've created together will stay strong. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1808/455626-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Photo by Roy Esterhuysen / 2018 Loerie Awards /" width="120" height="120">Loeries2018: Pete Case on winning a Grand Prix for 'The World's First Baby Marathon'Ogilvy Johannesburg took home a Grand Prix for Kimberly-Clark's 'The World's First Baby Marathon' in the film communication category at this year's Loerie Awards on Saturday, 18 August at the Durban ICC...By Jessica Tennant 31 Aug 2018Our recent business wins are a signal of the strength in our team, our portfolio of work and our offering. I’m most proud of two things in my time here. Firstly, seeing so many great people grow, and secondly being part of so much amazing work that’s worked. Our Grand Prix at Apex last week underlines this. The Ogilvy belief in work that is highly creative, while also having a strong commercial impact, is embedded deep in the veins of our teams here. This will remain a strong differentiator that drives the business from strength to strength.”During his time at Ogilvy, Case rose into the top 10 of the Gunn Report (now renamed the Warc report), which ranks the world’s best-performing CCOs.I’m proud that, as a team, we’ve managed to move both of our offices into the Ogilvy Top 20 creative rankings, out of more than 450 offices worldwide. This is an incredible acknowledgement of the teams’ dedication and the general standard of our work recently. I’d like to thank everyone at Ogilvy whom I’ve worked alongside for their passion and their belief in creativity. Also, thanks to our clients who have partnered on “out-of-the-ordinary” thinking with us. I joined an agency that was intent on redefining the future and I leave it still in the same exciting mindset. It’s been a huge privilege to be CCO of such an amazing company and I wish the business the best of success going forward.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1605/342997-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Pete Case" width="120" height="120">The 'Case' for Ogilvy's digital dominationMerge SA's most awarded digital agency with its closest competitor locally, add a sprinkle of digital wizardry and you have a winning formula for continued digital success...By Leigh Andrews 19 May 2016Taking the legacy forward“Pete will be sorely missed across all the Ogilvy teams,” said Ogilvy SA CEO Alistair Mokoena. “He brought passion, energy and oodles of creativity to his role.
