The experience reinforced my belief in the power of branding and how a challenger brand can stand out and make its mark.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/489149-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Beh says, “I hate selfies, so I hope the single patch of grass in the background doesn't disappoint!&amp;quot;" width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with...

With very little time and a much smaller budget than incumbent parties, I had to do things differently.My first task was to come up with a name. Instead of using an acronym like the other parties, I decided on a name that could stand on its own and represent what the party stands for.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/502996.jpg" alt="How youth expectations of local leadership mirror expectations of brands" width="120" height="120">How youth expectations of local leadership mirror expectations of brandsAs the African National Congress (ANC) celebrates its 2019 election victory, South Africans will now be turning their collective attention to President Cyril Ramaphosa to see if he can deliver on his party's promises...By Jenni Pennacchini, Issued by KLA - Kaufman Levin Associates 21 Jun 2019When it came to the logo design, I started from the end-point and where it matters most – on the ballot sheet. I lined up all the other logos and chose a colour that is distinctive and jumps out. I kept the design simple, so it wouldn’t get lost even when the logo is reduced to the size of a cherry.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/508208-625x325.jpg?3" alt="Image credit: Elliott Stallion on Unsplash." width="625" height="325">Image credit: Elliott Stallion on Unsplash.Positivity kills Politics is probably the only category – besides maybe insurance – that uses fear as an emotion to drive action. In the midst of so much negative news around us, I chose optimism and hope for the party’s personality and tonality.It is funny how political parties are allowed to say “Don’t vote for XXX”. That would never work in a business situation – firstly because you’re not allowed to but also why would you spend your money on publicising another brand instead of your own?<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496243-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Elections 2019: What it means now that all the votes have been counted" width="120" height="120">Elections 2019: What it means now that all the votes have been countedNow that the general elections have smoothly run their course and most of the speculations have abated, we expect an upswing of positive market sentiment...By Mike Greeff 13 May 2019Rather than pointing fingers, I chose to be action-driven. In the doom and gloom of South African politics, I believe that a party with a solutions-driven and inclusive message will stand out and offer an alternative to an audience who is tired of the same old excuses.My client was very clear that the change the country needed can’t just be driven by a political party or the government. They felt that the message needs to drive a movement where everyone should feel the need to participate.So, I created a rally cry that addresses what South Africans need and asked them to join me in taking action. I added a hashtag to the rally cry as I knew that most of the communications would be driven via social media.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/481071-120x120.jpg?2" alt="7 ways for political parties to win on social media before SA's national government elections" width="120" height="120">7 ways for political parties to win on social media before SA's national government electionsElection time is the perfect opportunity for political parties, and their leaders, to create a digital and social media strategy that resonates with their constituencies and keeps people engaged...By Mongezi Mtati 5 Feb 2019Unlikely partnershipI don’t have any experience in politics and my client didn’t have experience in marketing. It was refreshing to have a client who trusted me and looked to me for advice.Branding is an art, not a science.I relied on consumer research and data to inform my decisions but, ultimately, there really isn’t a right or wrong answer. Many a time, my recommendations are based on my experience and knowledge gained from working across different brands and projects.Working collaboratively between strategy and creative, agency and client, I managed to develop a brand that had an impact and led to success for my client in a very short period.People and publicityMost of the work that gave my client the best return probably isn’t seen by many.I gave them a platform that allowed them to rally their support on the ground. While the mass-marketing campaign drove awareness of the brand, it was the door-to-door knocking that garnered the votes they needed.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490774-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Despondent slogans" width="120" height="120">Despondent slogansIt is astonishing that the South African political parties have not identified that South Africans crave hope as well as confidence in the future...By Howard Feldman 4 Apr 2019Mass brands have a lot to learn from how parties gather their support – breaking the country into regions, cities and wards, they activated their supporters to change behaviour (or reinforce a behaviour) one-by-one.Run, run, runDid I say I didn’t have much time? I enjoy projects where there is a tight deadline with a clear goal.My new structure where clients work directly with the strategist and creative lead was definitely put to the test as I had to turnaround deliverables in less than half the time it normally takes.It made me prioritise what was important. Rather than trying to do too much, I went back to basics and made sure I did what was required with the most impact. I had to find new ways to collaborate with partners to execute the solutions quickly.Shorter deadlines can be a wonderful thing.I went into the project not knowing what to expect or what the results could be. While it was great to see the power of branding in play, I also had to consider the repercussions of what I was doing.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/493728-120x120.jpg?2" alt="How I wrote a shopper marketing strategy for a new political party" width="120" height="120">How I wrote a shopper marketing strategy for a new political partyShopping in a supermarket has nothing in common with voting in an election - or does it?By Sarah Britten 25 Apr 2019I consciously set out to drive a positive message that I hoped would rally people together to create change for good.Ultimately, I wasn’t only affecting the bottom line of a business, I was playing a small part in the fate of the nation.
