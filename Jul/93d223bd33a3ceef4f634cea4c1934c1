To create something that speaks to the heart of what it means to be a South African. This was the perfect opportunity for Grid, as over the last two years Grid has refined it’s methodology as ‘the make it mean something company’ rooted in the belief that every human being has an intrinsic need for meaning, and will constantly search for this meaning in the world around them. Grid, knowing the power of a beautifully told story, and its ability to convey deep meaning emotively, leveraged this to create a campaign for FNB and the Springboks that would not only demonstrate FNB’s purpose of enabling and empowering help, but also the unifying strength of rugby.The result of this can be seen with the 2019 campaign ‘Words change the game’. A campaign that shows how with FNB, all South Africans can become helpers inspiring and encouraging the Springboks, ultimately offering the most powerful support we can to our team while they play in Japan - the power of words.We reached out to 1995 Legends Francois Pienaar and Chester Williams, as well as 2007 Legends John Smit and Akona Ndungane to share with us the most meaningful words of inspiration that truly changed the game for them in their careers. They know firsthand the ability for words to uplift and affect our lives. And so they shared their stories, stories of how Mandela’s words to the team in the change room pre the iconic All Blacks match in 1995 inspired them to win. The Springboks of today and these Legends shared words captured in scrapbooked letters, shared from coaches, captains, family, friends and strangers alike that have boosted their belief in themselves and what they do for our country.  So we aim to capture and galvanize this magical power of words again for 2019. With the current Springboks team’s support, Grid and FNB have created a platform for 56 million South African voices to engage with the team and give their words of inspiration to the Boks via WhatsApp.In collaboration with Spitfire Films and Director Ed Van Blerk, these captured words were pieced together into a TTL campaign across TVC, digital, content, radio, OOH, Gautrain and in branch inviting all South Africans to submit their #WordsofGreatness. FNB will then share these words directly with the Springboks in the lead up to and in Japan, as well as across media channels countrywide.Client: FNB – SponsorshipCampaign Title: #WordsofGreatness Agency: Grid WorldwideCEO: Adam Byars CCO: Nathan ReddyECD: Clinton BridgefordCD / Writer: Lauren ShewitzCD: Chris CharouxArt Director: Schalk TheronGroup Account Director: Jessica WilkinsSenior Account Manager: Rush Bhana Account Manager: Jarryd BuchalterAgency Producer: Liesl LateganProduction company: Spitfire FilmsDirector: Ed Van BlerkDOP: Terence Maritz Production House Producer: Baleseng MakolaEditors: Ryan Norwood Young & Gareth James Post-production facility: Aces Up & LudusMusic/ Sound design: Paul Geddes at Madhaus
