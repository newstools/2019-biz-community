Publishers and their media sales houses created walled gardens and sold their best inventory at a premium while making remnant inventory available on programmatic platforms.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/499470-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Global Ad Trends report reveals internet ad formats account for majority of media spend" width="120" height="120">Global Ad Trends report reveals internet ad formats account for majority of media spendThe report reveals that internet ad formats already account for the majority of media spend in eight markets, including the US, UK and China...31 May 2019At the same time, programmatic evangelists were selling the benefits of reaching targeted audiences across multiple digital properties without the need to associate with specific platforms and brands.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/491302-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The only thing automatic ad buying needs now is the human touch" width="120" height="120">The only thing automatic ad buying needs now is the human touchProgrammatic buying is a tool and like any tool, it's only as effective as the person who wields it...By Warren Ravinsky 8 Apr 2019A stark contrast  A stark contrast was drawn between the two forms of buying. Premium advertising came to be seen as the expensive option for big brands with surplus budgets that were looking to build brand equity and associate themselves with top-draw digital publications.Programmatic was regarded as the “cheap” option for brands wanting to reach massive, semi targeted audiences for next to no spend.Considering the industry interests at play at the time, it is not surprising that the landscape evolved in this way. Publishers wanted to protect their inventory from being sold cheaply via programmatic.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504586-120x120.jpg?2" alt="IAB Insight Series: The role of technology in achieving business objectives" width="120" height="120">IAB Insight Series: The role of technology in achieving business objectivesThe latest Johannesburg edition of the monthly IAB Insight Series took place at the Park Inn by Radisson in Sandton on Thursday, 27 June, this time focusing on the role of technology in enabling business performance in the digital economy...By Jessica Tennant 2 Jul 2019They also wanted to protect their brand equity and avoid advertisers using them primarily for blind reach rather than for the quality of their brand.The result was an industry conversation focused on premium versus programmatic, leaving many clients with the belief that it was an either-or choice. There are still some sales houses and advertisers that hold this view and, years later, it’s not uncommon for budgets to be entirely allocated to one or the other.However, as our understanding grows in the benefits of each form of digital media buying, more organisations are realising that both serve a purpose and that robust strategies should include an element of each. These are the brands that are winning. Still, it is time to re-evaluate the terminology to change the conversation for brands still looking at it as a binary choice.Blurred lines If not ‘premium digital advertising’, what should we be calling it? Let’s consider this question by looking at how the line between premium and programmatic is blurring.Premium publishers are now onboarding their programmatic offerings, which they control from beginning to end. The rate differential between premium and programmatic is vanishing as a result of this development. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507514.jpg" alt="The agency of the future: no agency?" width="120" height="120">The agency of the future: no agency?"Clients do not want a retained agency any more.

Dean Delaney, Managing Director at DAN Tanzania, discusses...Issued by Dentsu Aegis Network 19 Jul 2019What’s more, both forms of buying offer premium positions since media owners no longer hold back their best placements or leave only the remnant inventory to programmatic platforms. Soon ‘premium or programmatic?’ will become a moot question and brands will look at how these options can be used to deliver the right solution. In reality, premium versus programmatic is now more about whether one purchases directly from a media owner or programmatically via a demand-side platform that has access to the major publishers and media owners.In many cases, we are seeing agencies dealing with the media owner directly to structure a specific deal or opportunity. This deal is packaged under a Deal ID and then purchased programmatically via the trading desk.This works because publishers and their sales houses know their platforms inside-out and can provide holistic, tailored solutions and creative ideas that will help brands achieve their desired outcome.Everyone wins, especially the client – which receives a solution that reaches the audiences it requires across credible, brand-safe platforms.

Let’s change the conversation to focus on outcomes and solutions rather than on how we buy inventory.
