Strategically located at key intersections in the city, these double-sided directional signs are ideal for but not limited to small businesses, fast foods, banks, retailers, fuel stations and car dealerships to drive customers in store.This solar system is designed for extreme weather and environmental conditions, delivering 1,000 lumens, nine hours illumination and three days battery stand-by. Having retained the advertising contract in September 2018, the new solar-powered Adlites are environmentally friendly as they do not use electricity but only solar energy panels that are affixed to the top of the structure. “Directional signage has proven to be effective for both motorists and pedestrians in locating facilities and local businesses. Our commitment to installing these solar-powered panels provide cost-effective media platforms for brands to deliver proximity messaging, while at the same time offering extended branding opportunities 24-hours a day”, said Tamara van Eeckhoven, Chief Operating Officer of Primedia Outdoor Rest-of-Africa.Primedia Outdoor’s Adlites holding in Namibia speaks to its solid commitment to deliver on strategic and effective product locations in order to reach audiences at the right time and place in key markets.
