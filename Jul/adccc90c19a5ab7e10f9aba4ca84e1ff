In 2018 151 tonnes of food was collected. In 2017 130 tonnes was collected in its inaugural campaign, this equates to more than 1.1 million meals donated to beneficiaries in need.The food collected in the Mandela Day Food Drive supports the 530 beneficiary organisations in FoodForward SA’s national distribution network. These donations won’t only help with immediate needs but will also assist in stocking FoodForward SA’s warehouses with staple food reserves for months when supply is low. Shoppers are encouraged to donate from a list of 15 discounted non-perishable items displayed in participating Pick n Pay stores or online, make a small cash donation at the till points; or volunteer their time.The donated food will be sorted on Mandela Day by volunteers at packing events across the country. In Midrand, Volunteers will pack at Gallagher Convention Centre. FoodForward SA will then distribute the packed food to its beneficiary organisations nationally. Food donations made at more remote Pick ‘n Pay stores will be distributed directly to surrounding beneficiaries on Mandela Day.Take part in one of the nationwide packing events to sort donated groceries into food parcels. There are four 67-minute shifts starting at 9am. Book your 67-minute slot on Webtickets: https://www.webtickets.co.za/v2/Event.aspx?itemid=1491283982.
