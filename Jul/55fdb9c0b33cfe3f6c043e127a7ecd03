The pet food segment (which comprises more than 90% of pet care market revenue) increased at a CAGR of just 1.9% between 2013 and 2018 in value terms, with a small decline in volume over the past two years. Despite the poor market sales, many pet owners are investing more money in their pets and aligning their pet’s lifestyle with their own, in order to provide their pets with the highest quality products. Given this trend, pet owners’ focus on the quality of products has significantly increased in recent years, with product labels and ingredients being carefully scrutinised before purchase. Pet owners are also spending more on pet insurance policies in South Africa, which is enabling pet owners to provide the best possible healthcare for their pets. A new trend that is gaining in popularity is ‘doga’ or dog yoga, further highlighting the focus on pet health and wellness. Dog yoga provides the opportunity for pet owners to spend time with their pets, whilst also providing the opportunity for the pets to interact with other pets. It has been shown that these classes help calm and relax pets as well as their owners. With pets being treated as part of the family, it is becoming more crucial for key players to stay abreast of the latest developments within the industry, to ensure they meet pet owners’ dynamic needs in terms of food, health and wellness.
