The conference’s two-day programme included a factory tour, product demos, presentations about the latest global industry trends, and an interactive workshop on growing the partnerships. Delegates also attended Madex, the annual Marketing, Advertising and Design Expo at Sandton Convention Centre, where they visited Scan Display’s stand and browsed the show to see what the local market has to offer. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506678-625x416.jpg" alt="Scan Display hosts first African Distributor Conference" width="625" height="416">Charles Campbell Clause, Director of Exhibition Stand Contractors in Kenya, says: “I represented ESC at the conference which was most interesting and beneficial for us.
