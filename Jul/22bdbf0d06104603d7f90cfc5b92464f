Some brands or businesses exist just to meet the bare minimum required to be in that industry.Elevate beyond the expectedHow many soccer players are there? When we are talking soccer or football, a handful of players come to mind – some have pure talent, but most combine talent with hard work; elevating the value they bring to the field of play.To be sought after, not just to stand out, not just to be different for the sake of being different, but to be seen or perceived as the only option with no other alternative, requires you and your brand to elevate beyond the expected. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506173-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Monique Claassen, director of media and digital insights at Millward Brown and Jane Ostler, global head of media, presenting at Kantar's Cape Town 'Roadmap to Media Effectiveness' event." width="120" height="120">Context conquers platform: Connecting with the new-world consumerAhead of Kantar's 'best liked ads of 2018' reveal, two sessions were hosted in Cape Town and Johannesburg on the art and science of media success, with a special focus on finding the right mix of channels and creative to #GetMediaRight...By Leigh Andrews 11 Jul 2019If you are a brand that exists in a “saturated” market, please note that the market is not saturated, the market is filled with the same or similar thinking.

Do what you need to do.
