The agency also achieved 51% black ownership during her tenure.Brenda is highly respected by peers and clients alike for her experience and passion for brand building. “Brenda was an asset to Collective ID, so we are sad to see her go. As the Management Team of Collective ID we wish her well on her future endeavours,” says Dave Livie, Non-Executive Director on the Board of Collective ID. “It was not an easy decision to make. However, I leave CID with a wealth of knowledge, achievements and lots of good memories. In 2018 CID won Financial Mail Adfocus Small Agency of the Year as well as a few transformation awards, and recently won Puma Lubricants by Puma Energy. I thank the CID family, my courageous business partner, Sharon Bergmann, and our clients, who trusted me with their business. I wish our paths will cross again in the near future.” says Brenda Khumalo.
