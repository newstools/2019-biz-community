Data and digital technology continue to affect every sector, showing that all businesses are under tremendous pressure to innovate. This puts great strain on leaders and managers, since innovation, just like strategy, starts at the top and is historically difficult to sustain. So, where does the problem lie? The key problem is purpose. Innovation in itself is not a sustainable or long-term motivator, which means that campaigns will be short-lived or run out of steam if this is the only foundation. Many companies fall into the trap of not identifying a clear media strategy for the platforms beforehand, which is the long-term guidance brands need. This is why the question every brand should ask themselves when it comes to innovation is: Am I using innovation with a key driver or purpose, or am I innovating just for the sake of innovation?Innovate with purpose When innovation is filling a need gap, solving a problem, or enhancing an experience, it becomes an innovation that is tangible and real. If you are looking at leveraging individual technological (or traditional) media without proper integration and business goals in mind, then you’re likely wasting your media budget. There isn’t much innovation in basing media strategies on features that might seem ‘gimmicky’ to the user.If instead, you focus your media efforts on the results it creates, then you set yourself up for meaningful innovation. Rather look at the experience your audience will have and what they will ultimately gain from that experience — innovation with purpose. This is where innovation will set your brand apart from the rest.MediaCom South Africa’s Business Unit Director: Coca-Cola, Brian Muguto, says, “In an age where consumers are choosing or discarding brands based on whether or not they share the same beliefs, they are more interested in the value that comes from brand experiences/interactions. That said, brands need to directly translate the value they bring — beyond just products and services — into how they deploy media. Essentially, they need to innovate with purpose.”Back to business Some may disagree, but creativity isn’t the alpha and omega of an effective and innovative media strategy. While creative concepts and campaigns may require some measure of unique vision and artistic talent, there is another driver that generates more meaningful results. That driver is business results. The ultimate goal of a business is to grow sales. This doesn’t imply that being creative is bad or unnecessary. In fact, creative-led campaigns can deliver some of the most meaningful results (just look at Nando’s South African campaigns). The main driver behind each and every campaign should still be data-backed results that can be measured. Make sure not to sacrifice effectiveness for creativity. Effective media strategies ensure that your brand messages reach the right audience, at the right time. And defining your message will have a greater impact on your success than the number of features you can integrate into your campaign.“Solving real business challenges could be seen as the one true driver in a media strategy. If your innovative use of media is not maximising the impact of the solution, then it renders itself useless,” says Reenav Modi, Strategy Director: Coca-Cola. Like many things in media planning, the key differentiator is balance — striking the perfect balance between creative concepts and business results will prove for better results overall.A connected ecosystemOnce a strategic (and innovative) solution has been created, the key still lies in correct and thorough execution. “This needs to be distributed consistently and seamlessly from one touch point to the other — always moving the customer down the story path so that, ultimately, each experience across screens and off-screen leads to the business goal,” says Muguto. Sometimes there may be a disconnect between the different media touchpoints; sometimes even between the creative media strategy, its execution, and what the brand goals are. But if the business goal is the clear end-strategy, there will be no ‘dead-ends’. It’s all about the audience Identifying clear objectives and a cohesive direction according to the business results required is the only way to guarantee no ‘dead-ends’. And the only way that this will be achieved is if, as media specialists, we put the consumer first. The very person that will be exposed to the realisation of the strategic business goals.Lelentle Legalatladi, Digital Strategist: Coca-Cola, sums it up well: “A comprehensive and calculated media strategy can mean the difference between a potential customer and a random individual. Media innovation should come from a clear and concise goal while taking effective business results into account.”There is no good reason to ‘pray and spray’ incomprehensive campaigns and communication at a potential audience. This is why balancing creativity and business objectives are not only important, but imperative if the focus is on your customer, and not simply on the need to call a campaign innovative.
