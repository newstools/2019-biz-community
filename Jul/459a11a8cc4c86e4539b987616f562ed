Dawn Rowlands, CEO of DAN sub-Saharan Africa, said: “Moving people is what we do all day, every day. Moving their perceptions, feelings, memories and habits, to ensure we move the dial on our clients’ businesses. Moving people has also moved the dial in our own business quite significantly, particularly in the last two years. Many new people have “moved-in”… so much so that about 40% of all the people who work at Dentsu are new. All around us, the industry talk is “adapt or die”. We need to move, shift and morph less than many of our competitors, but still, to do this effectively we need a guide and a map of the unknown. With this being said, the appointment of Erica Hannath as our chief talent development officer across SSA is essential to our future growth and to guide and develop our people agenda.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/509281.jpg" alt="Dentsu Aegis Network SSA appoints chief talent development officer" width="300" height="294">Erica joins Dentsu Aegis Network following a successful career in both the corporate, start-up and NGO sectors.
