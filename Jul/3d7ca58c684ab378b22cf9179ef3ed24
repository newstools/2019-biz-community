This, says Women in Tech ZA co-founder Samantha Perry, was done deliberately to both showcase the depth and breadth of female expertise in the tech sector, but also to challenge South Africa’s conference organisers to make their line-ups more representative. “The problem is so pervasive, a new name for those panel discussions that feature male speakers only -  the manel - has been coined. It’s time for local companies and conference organisers to step up and ensure that their speaker line-ups reflect the diversity of both the sector and country we operate in,” says Useful and Beautiful chief product officer Lynette Hundermark. The full line-up for the 10 July event includes:  Anna Collard - Popcorn Training - a KnowBe4 company, founder and MD - Female entrepreneurship in Cyber Security.  Ashnie Muthusamy – Group Talent Management at Sun International - Maintaining balance and flow.  Barbara Mallinson - Obami founder and CEO - Oh, the lessons I’ve learned!
