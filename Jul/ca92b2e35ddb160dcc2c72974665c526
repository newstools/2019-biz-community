Expanding on that, Campaign Brief says you’ll “work with the creative leadership teams on both sides of the Tasman to recruit the region’s best talent to the network, in addition to fostering opportunities for the agency’s rising stars.” Why is it so important to have a hand in selecting the creatives of the future? I think we sometimes forget this is a talent business. And talent is a real thing. Give me the best tennis racquet in the world and I am not beating Federer.The bulls#it that anybody can have an idea – that may be true. But can anybody do it under pressure, day after day? Can they do it in a couple of hours? Can they do something fresh? The answer is ‘no’. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1808/454083-120x120.jpg?2" alt="What do you want creativity to do?" width="120" height="120">What do you want creativity to do?"What can creativity do?"

How does the Australia/New Zealand creative scene differ to what you remember from your SA days?I think it would be unfair for me to compare markets, especially one that I am sure has changed in the eight years since I have been there.

A post shared by  Damon Stapleton (@dbs81270) on Mar 1, 2019 at 8:06pm PST What I will say is if there is one thing that is always true, it is that no matter the budget, the scale or the challenge, creativity and ideas are always what matters the most in any market. It is something that makes South Africa special.  You don’t have the scale, so the ideas have to be great..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}We know you’re largely behind the scenes, but there’s no denying you’ve won over 500 international awards and your Damon’s Brain posts have global readership. Any interesting ‘fan’ moments where people recognise you on the street/at international award shows? I think if you think you are famous because of advertising, you might be a wanker. Having said that, I have had someone shout out my name in a lobby in Vegas, saying he loved my blog. And I do get people talking to me like we have known each other for years. That can be weird!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Clearly you’re in high regard.
