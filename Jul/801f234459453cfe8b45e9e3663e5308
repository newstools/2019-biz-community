Boomtown director, Glen Meier says, “Our strategy is to leverage the global Lafarge brand reputation within the local market heritage.” Using insights gained from immersing itself in the market, the team at Boomtown will have a tactical approach to the brief that leverages its meaningful insights. “Zambians have been using Lafarge products since 1949, and it’s this heritage that is at the heart of the communications strategy. We were able to uncover insights that connect with the market and consumer through an emotional and aspirational campaign. The campaign focuses on celebrating Lafarge’s 70-year heritage and emphasises how it has been building Zambia since 1979. The campaign also speaks to building the dreams of the Zambian people,” adds Glen Meier. Zambia as a country is experiencing one of the fastest growth rates in terms of investment in cement capacity compared to the rest of the continent. Lafarge is a premium brand in Zambia, and its market share was impacted by challenger brands from China and Nigeria who were entering at a lower price within the retail sector. The campaign aims to stimulate demand from end users and reinforce the trust in Lafarge, highlighting how the product is reliable, high-quality and built on a foundation of 70 years within Zambia.
