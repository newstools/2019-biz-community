An earlier start is on the cards for viewer court date appointments with Judge Judy which will start at 4:20pm. Firm favourite Days of our Lives will follow suit at 4:45pm. The Wild will be replaced by the Afrikaans telenovela and will now move across to Openview and will air at 6:05pm on eExtra (Channel 105 and DStv channel 195). Speaking on the programme change, e.tv Marketing Manager Maki Mokome said, “Our vision as e.tv has always been for us to become the entertainment provider of choice in Africa. As a channel that endeavours to maintain that vision, it was only a matter of time before our content expanded. We believe that Die Vreemdeling will be an exciting drama addition to the existing content on offer. Our viewership numbers have been showing positive growth and demand for our Afrikaans content and we hope to continue providing our viewers with content that delights them.” Die Vreemdeling, which in English means “The Stranger”, is about a chance meeting that takes place in a quiet and peaceful town called Korludag, between a handsome stranger, Dapper, and a wealthy businesswoman named Suhan. The chance meeting leads to an irresistible attraction, but there is a burning issue at play that the love interests don't know about. Their dream of happiness will soon turn into an impossible love when the long-standing opposition between their families that have been long-time enemies starts to cause a strong rift between them. Die Vreemdeling will additionally be available for all Openview subscribers on the eExtra channel (Channel 105 and DStv channel 195) at 8:00pm.
