For Mandela Day, 67 designers come together to design 67 logos for 67 small businesses. It pulls together the creative industry to design for change. At least 70% of South African small businesses fail within the first three years of business. This shows how difficult it is for a small business to stand out and make an impact on the South African market. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507312-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Snøhetta reveals new Madiba-inspired &amp;quot;peace bench&amp;quot;" width="120" height="120">Snøhetta reveals new Madiba-inspired "peace bench"The inspiration for the bench came from the famous Nelson Mandela quote: "The best weapon is to sit down and talk"...18 Jul 2019If we drive SMEs and ensure their success, it will help boost the South African economy and boost young entrepreneurs to do more and be more. Many small businesses can’t afford a professionally-designed logo. We believe that a logo will give them the necessary boost of confidence and a chance to stand out,” says Lesley Waterkeyn, Group CEO at CWDi.Empowering entrepreneurs Phumzile Mthembu, owner of Ingcweti, says that she feels empowered and encouraged to be part of this amazing initiative.“Entrepreneurship is a lonely journey but having designers dedicate their time to design logos that will help us elevate our businesses shows that we are not alone. For me, this means growth and higher levels for my business. I am motivated an excited as I can now present my businesses to other organisations and present myself professionally,” she says.“I really enjoyed being part of the 67 Logos Designathon as it was fun and very inspiring. I feel good about being able to help a small business bring their vision for a logo to life. This was my first time taking part in this initiative but it’s something that I would like to do again. What I loved the most what that I got to do what I enjoy doing, except this time around I was doing it to help a business,” says designer Nomonde Mtetwa.
