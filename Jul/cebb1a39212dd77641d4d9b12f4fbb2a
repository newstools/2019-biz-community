Three key fields influencing the growth of evidence-based marketing include observed consumer behaviour, behavioural economics and cognitive neuroscience.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490683-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Evidence based marketing - what is it and why do we need it?" width="120" height="120">Evidence based marketing - what is it and why do we need it?The concepts of behavioural economics, observed consumer behaviour and neuro-marketing are enough to make any marketer head for the hills out of the sheer fear of not knowing where to begin. Kirsty Dugmore of SugaSpice puts it simply...By Kirsty Dugmore 3 Apr 2019These empirically-based studies can help to explain and predict effective communication, giving us the tools and knowledge to execute much better marketing. Effective marketing is crucial, as brands provide the revenue which is the lifeblood of any business. At its core, marketing’s purpose is to influence behaviour – so it makes sense to leverage what science knows about human behaviour.Consumer behaviour Observed consumer behaviour (OCB) is a measure of in-market, actual purchasing behaviour. The pioneers of observed consumer behaviour are the Ehrenberg-Bass Institute (EBI) – the world’s largest centre for research into marketing.Its website states:“Our team of 50+ marketing scientists are advancing marketing knowledge, busting pseudo-science and marketing myths and teaching marketers how marketing really works and how brands grow.”EBI has also published a bestselling book entitled How Brands Grow by Byron Sharp. This book provides evidence-based answers to the key questions asked by marketers every day. EBI is backed by over 40 years of research, across 30 countries, science, universal patterns of consumer behaviour and establishing empirical marketing laws.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/491538-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Shifting the cloud on consumer behaviour" width="120" height="120">Shifting the cloud on consumer behaviourWith the festive season excitement now over, the start of 2019 has so far been bleak for the majority of retailers in South Africa...By Isana Cordier 9 Apr 2019This promising discipline offers insights into predictable patterns and behaviours and offers practical advice that marketers can implement in their marketing and media strategies.Behavioural economics has influenced many industries. Originating in economics, it has infiltrated medicine, teaching and politics – former US president Barack Obama established the unit, officially known as the Social and Behavioural Sciences Team (SBST) – and marketing is no exception. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that behavioural science insights – research findings from fields such as behavioural economics and psychology about how people make decisions and act on them – can be used to design better communication. Buying a brand after all is a decision.At the heart of behavioural economics is the concept of system one and system two (Daniel Kahneman). The crux of this thinking is the notion that people use instinct, intuition and emotion in all of their choices (system one thinking). There are many well-respected influencers in this field, a few include Dan Ariely, Phil Barden, Richard Shotton, the IPA.co.uk.Making (brain)waves Marketers are enthralled with the possibilities of applying neuroscience techniques to consumer research and have teamed up with brain science experts eager to find commercial applications for their work, giving rise to the new field of neuro-marketing. Neuro-marketing allows us the opportunity to understand how the brain really works and responds to communications.Most interesting is that although observed consumer behaviour, behavioural economics and cognitive neuroscience are seemingly unrelated disciplines – much of the empirical evidence is aligned. Most notably is that consumers aka humans make mostly snap decisions using cognitive shortcuts. The easier a decision is to make, the better and stronger the brand is.   <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506561-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Data-driven marketing and advertising; and how to harness new customer data insights" width="120" height="120">Data-driven marketing and advertising; and how to harness new customer data insightsWe sit in meetings with heads of different departments to plan the next marketing and advertising campaigns.
