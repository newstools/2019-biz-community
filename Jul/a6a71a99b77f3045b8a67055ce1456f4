Misogyny, sexism, gender-based violence and abuse of women and children are devastating. The role of the arts in helping to shift destructive narratives is crucial for empowering women and changing our society for the better.” This year’s instalment boasts of over 20 works that are strictly created by women.Poetry and jazzA newly added feature to the festival is the Open Market and Live Music segment that will take place every Sunday.
