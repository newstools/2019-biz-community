According to industry insiders, pub funerals, memorial festivals and wake concerts are among the more popular choices for a funeral to end all funerals.“Services are more life-centered, around the person’s personality, likes and dislikes. They’re unique and not standardised. The only way we can survive is to provide the services that families find meaningful.” ~ Former American funeral association president Mark MusgroveCelebration of life plannersTo attend to this emerging market for more elaborate funerals, new job opportunities are arising: “celebration-of-life planners” and "funeral consultants” are essentially party planners for high-end, personalised experiential funerals.

Funeral eventing companies are now also encouraging grieving families to take advantage of their services to arrange annual death-day ritual events on the anniversary of a loved one's death. At these death day affairs, the deceased person is remembered through a ritual ceremony, similar to the way they were honoured on their birthday every year while they were still living.
