"Then suddenly the foreign minister mentions, almost in passing, that the journalist is apparently dead. This is wholly inadequate and distressing. The government must immediately share publicly all information it has about Gwanda's fate."<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/491242-120x120.jpg" alt="Still missing: Azory Gwanda." width="120" height="120">#WhereIsAzory campaign launched to find missing Tanzania journalistThe Committee to Protect Journalists' #WhereIsAzory campaign launches to highlight the fact that the Tanzanian journalist has been missing for 500 days ...5 Apr 2019Kabudi told the BBC that the Tanzanian government is not "proud" of the disappearances and killings in Rufiji, which he said also took the lives of police officers and ruling party officials, and said that the government was taking measures to make sure that citizens and journalists are safe. However, CPJ research shows that impunity in journalists' deaths or disappearances contributes to an environment that fosters violence against journalists.CPJ's phone calls today to Kabudi and Tanzanian government spokesperson Hassan Abbassi went unanswered.
