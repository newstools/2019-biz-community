A way of doing things differently. Not just for the sake of being different but for the sake of being better. We wanted to find a way to introduce a whole new audience to the sport by completely reimagining the experience of watching a horse race. And we wanted to do it in a way that would transform the sport by building an unforgettable experience around it. Like so many crazy ideas, it began quite by chance. And, not surprisingly, at night. We were at a race course one evening when we were struck by the energy and intensity of the moment and how powerful and majestic the horses looked under floodlights. That’s when we knew we had to create something that could share the experience with others. That’s when we knew we had to share the moment with other people by creating something special, something epic. Equinity night-time horseracing is different in so many ways. Yes, it’s held at night. But that’s just the start of it. We place cameras in places no-one else has thought of to give you a completely different perspective of the race. We have microphones on the track so that you hear every crash of a horse’s hoof and every breath from its nostrils. Then we play it all to you live on huge, state-of-the-art screens that change the way the sport is experienced forever. That’s just the racing. Each event is created from scratch, with an original, fantastical theme that’s designed to provide a truly unique, and somewhat edgy, experience. The performances are provocative, thrilling and sensual. They exist to celebrate liberal ideals, shatter preconceptions and embrace a culture of tolerance, freedom and diversity. The unconventional themes, outlandish décor and flamboyant costumes are the canvas from which the artists and performers create a rainbow of self-expression. Your every sense indulged, your every moment immersed in a fantasy world created just for you. That’s how Equinity was born. With an indelible, untamed spirit and a passion for horseracing. For our team, horseracing is about loving the beauty and power of horses while believing that the sport must serve a greater good. To this end change is vital. Our mission is to create and build dynamic events which entice a massive new audience to the sport. A new dawn beckons.
