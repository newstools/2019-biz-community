The Reception was attended by key festival sponsors and partners as well members of the diplomatic corps, who went on to enjoy a packed performance by local star Samthing Soweto. According to BASA Head of Marketing, Savannah Feek, “SPOTLIGHT is exactly the kind of initiative which speaks to BASA’s purpose as it brings together key partners in a way that truly generates shared value. The publication supports artists performing at the festival, so it serves as a platform for promotion, but it’s also a space for media to critically engage with the work and to offer audience expert insights in navigating everything on offer at the festival.” Feeke explains that that the National Arts Festival Arena, presented by Business and Arts South Africa, is a platform which “links the festival’s fringe and main platforms, in that Standard Bank Ovation Award winners from the previous year’s festival are showcased alongside award-winning works from partner international festivals.” She adds that 2018 marks the second Creativate Digital Arts Festival and the first year that BASA is a strategic partner on this key new festival platform which “explores the intersection between creativity and technology”. The National Arts Festival runs until 7 July 2019. For more information please visit www.nationalartsfestival.co.za.
