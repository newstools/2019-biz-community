Then you can’t afford to miss KidEx! This innovative expo will showcase the latest in children’s education, development and fashion while the KidEx FunZone provides an activity programme that the kids are sure to love and parents browse the stands.KidEx kicks off in Johannesburg from 23-25 August at The Canvas Riversands, located at Riversands Incubation Hub past Fourways.Parents can view all things kids related - from potential pre-schools, schools, educational toy manufacturers, to outdoor jungle gym manufacturers, children’s furniture manufacturers, family photographers, children’s transport services and even extra-curricular activities like kids coding academies.Basically, think everything you’ve Googled under one roof. KidEx is the brainchild of Tina Bodill, a marketing and communications entrepreneur. It was only when she became a mother herself that the idea for KidEx occurred to her. She says, “As parents, we want to give our children the best, but you’re constantly pressed for time and it’s not always viable to scour the internet for the latest products and services that support their growth and development. For example, attending school open days may not be possible. So, I thought about an event for busy parents –a one-stop shop - where parents can browse all the innovative options related to children in one convenient location. Whether you’re looking for cool new clothing brands, language classes for your toddler or party entertainers – we’ve got everything you could need at KidEx.”While Bodill and her team have worked on large events and conferences before - this is the first of its kind event in South Africa. “Overall, the response from the public has been great, sharing in the excitement around the convenience of visiting one venue with the most innovative children’s related options under one roof! We can all agree that the economy has been difficult but parents still prioritise their children in a tough economic climate.”Bodill is particularly excited about the home of KidEx, The Canvas Riversands as she says, “For an event as unique as KidEx, we looked at a number of venues. The Canvas was the obvious choice. Not only does the venue offer ample indoor and outdoor space, room for the KidEx FunZone as well as secure parking, the team at Riversands have been phenomenal in sharing our vision and ensuring KidEx is set for success!”In addition, the conference centre’s relationship with the Riversands Incubation Hub allows for related small businesses to participate in the KidEx platform.This is not to mention The Canvas Riversands’ central location. It’s conveniently situated in Fourways, within close proximity to Dainfern, Steyn City and Midrand. It’s also close to Sandton and Centurion with plenty of secure parking.The one aspect of the expo that will hold the greatest appeal to parents and their kids is The KidEx FunZone, a safe space for kids to enjoy various entertainment options from the children’s entertainment industry, while parents are free to browse the stands at their leisure. The FunZone will offer a wonderful mix of fun and education. The entertainment options are all age-appropriate and caters for two major age groups; 2-6 and 7-12-year-olds. There will be science shows, robotics and coding activities, soft play areas and even a range of different children’s entertainers to keep the party going. And what’s an expo without food - visitors will be spoilt for choice with a tempting array of different options all boasting plenty of kid-friendly choices. Bodill says, “Since this is a child-orientated expo, we’ve gone the extra mile to ensure this is a child-friendly venue even insisting all food vendors cater specifically for youngsters as well - with special menu items. We’ve also been very strict with the security aspect for the FunZones. It’s a closed environment, with only one entrance and exit point and arm bands to ensure children are checked in and out safely.” “There are so many different exciting and innovative kid’s brands out there and we’d love to give them a platform to showcase their offerings,” she says. There are a few spots left so if you’d like to exhibit in the indoor space, outdoor arena or become a FunZone activity host or want more information visit, the KidEx website on www.kidex.co.za or email hello@kidex.co.zabRev('brev-bde4a15c-258e-4baf-a3f9-62d00aa2d6e4', '>a/\<az.oc.xedik@olleh>"az.oc.xedik;46#&olleh:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
