M-Gurush is a mobile-based and digital services solution that will work with anyone that has a handset across South Sudan. Basically, services that will be available on M-Gurush include the following; cash in, cash out, bill payment, airtime purchases, cross-border remittances, and power payment options. These services will primarily run on a USB or a mobile application,” said Arinaibwe.The new mobile commerce platform is licensed by the Bank of South Sudan and the National Communication Authority.The representative of Zain, Victor Omonmdi has given his assurance that the mobile money was not coming to replace banks but to create job opportunities for young people and women, especially in rural areas.Omonmdi concluded, “Since it is hard to reach the local population in the countryside, mobile money will complement the formal banking services. With the mobile money service, goods will be purchased using M-Gurush and this will ease the burden of carrying money.”Source: NexTVAfrica.com.
