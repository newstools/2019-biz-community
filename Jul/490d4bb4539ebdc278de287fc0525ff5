On this platform I profile chief marketing officers, marketing and brand communication managers to gain knowledge of what is paramount to them when we speak marketing and brand communications. These individuals are our partners when it comes to meeting brand and business objectives.  Hi Kgosi, Please tell us a bit about yourself and your career.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504904.jpg?1" alt="The Client Side: Kgosietsile Moalusi" width="307" height="550">Kgosietsile Moalusi - Marketing Manager at DStv under the Mass Market Portfolio. My motivation stems from seeing the dynamic relationship between brands and the people they serve.  The understanding of this relationship scintillated my academic interest when I embarked on my postgraduate studies at the IMM GSM. As a marketer, I believe this grounding is what will develop our careers and the science in both the academia and the corporate sphere. What is the advertising/marketing quote or saying you live by? “Nothing Ventured, Nothing Gained” How would you define advertising effectiveness as a client?Advertising effectiveness, I would define as having strong advertising agency partners that are able to deliver on brand and business objectives using disruptive means that challenge the status quo. In order to achieve this advertising partners should immerse themselves in the brand. Creative awards, how important are they to you as a client?What fuels my engine is the ambition to achieve insightful campaigns delivered through creative excellence where the consumer at the pinnacle of the creative piece - that for me is an award in itself. Creative risk needs backing by clients if brands want to break creative boundaries - trailblazers - in the industry, which will translate into Creative Awards.  I believe there is nothing wrong in having a winning mentality in the marketing and brand communication space.  Where do you think advertising agencies can improve to better serve their clients? Advertising agencies have to some degree forgotten to immerse themselves in the clients business. Clearly understanding the clients business is a principle that cuts across the agencies stakeholders involved with the brand ranging from account management through to creative teams. This will lead to a better output/achieving objectives.  How do you ensure there is transformation in the advertising and marketing industry?I am a huge advocate of “Black Excellence” and fully endorse the mandate it stands for. I put up my hand, play my part and do what I can to do to make some kind of change. As a young professional who has access to influencing some key decisions, which may potentially change the landscape of advertising and possibly empower more black female and/or male owned agencies...  What is your measure metrics to choosing an advertising agency partner? Unfortunately, I do not get involved largely concerning this particular question, however I believe that my own criteria would involve an agency having a strong strategic and dynamic creative team with a complement of a well-refined account management and production team.  Everyday client advertising agency relationships – what are your key needs from an ad agency to make your life easier? Having an agency partner that is genuinely interested and committed in what you do as a business/client is always important. We live in such a fast-paced world so by virtue of having a proactive/pre-emptive agency partner who is so immersed in what you do and need as a business, it automatically makes a client’s life much easier.
