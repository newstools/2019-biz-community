Neville Pillay (48), a former ECR and Lotus FM presenter and comedian, recently suffered a heart attack and mild stroke. In addition, the blood vessels in his eyes burst, which has resulted in him being left with partial vision and his kidneys have started to fail. Neville’s wife, Carol, has said their lives have been turned upset down. “We do not have medical aid so are relying on the government hospitals which in itself has many challenges. We have used up all our savings and are now looking for financial assistance with medical costs.” Neville and Carol have two girls, 17 and 8. Carol adds, “Neville is just surviving. Our kids are at their lowest, seeing their dad this way. Our youngest refuses to go to school because she is afraid something will happen to him and the older one, out of desperation, posted about our plight on her dad’s Facebook page.” Speaking on behalf of Hot 91.9FM, Lloyd Madurai said, “Hot Cares will cover their medical aid contributions for one year – up to the value of R50,000. We at Hot 91.9FM believe in the power of community, especially community coming together to help others. With this in mind, we would appreciate any assistance that our South African Community can give to Neville Pillay and his family - you can make a difference!” If you are able to assist the Pillay family, please email hotcares@hot919.co.zabRev('brev-83daee8f-8085-4eaa-90f9-86d1e3fb2fc5', '>a/\<az.oc.919toh@seractoh>"az.oc.919toh;46#&seractoh:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
