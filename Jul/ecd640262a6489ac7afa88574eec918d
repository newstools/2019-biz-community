InHabit is about improving the way people live in their homes and how they connect with everything around them. This includes environmental sustainability, story sharing, supporting local businesses and being better informed about product origins. The 2020 Johannesburg HOMEMAKERS Expo will once again give visitors the chance to see, touch, feel and compare the latest home products and services. It’s an opportunity to do more than merely occupy a space, it’s about developing a lifestyle where people truly InHabit spaces and boldly connect with those around them. Show features include:Raw Workshop An expo favourite, the Raw Workshop will bring a wealth of interesting demonstrations where craftsmen will show off the beginnings of their product of trade. Visitors will find themselves at the heart of product development and get to experience how a range of DIY and raw products are made.

Visitors can expect a fun-filled programme that will leave them skilled, inspired and InHabiting their kitchen in a whole new way. Designer Spaces Be inspired by authentic design styles of the world. Local interior designers will be given the challenge to create a space inspired by their favourite country. In this demo space visitors will see what the chosen interior designers have created and be able to ask questions on how to incorporate their favourite style into their home. Young Designers Challenge The Industrial Design students from the University of Johannesburg will once again take up a special Johannesburg HOMEMAKERS Challenge. Visitors to the Young Designers Challenge will be able to see the products that will potentially help them InHabit their spaces in the future.
