This ‘face-time’ is where you get to ask questions directly and be more assured that the collaboration will work.Are their followers engaged with their content? Are they engaging with their followers frequently through Q&As, polls, video stories, meet-and-greets or do they have a “look at me” approach? It is never just about the number of followers.Being able to determine an influencer’s engagement rate in relation to their following is hugely important. When I get asked the question, “What do you look at, followers or engagement?” My answer is always engagement.I've found that the best results are achieved when selecting a combination of macro and micro-influencers who create relevant and authentic content – because they are the ‘creative directors’ of the content and, in turn, receive great engagement from their audiences (large or small).<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/492093-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: Getty/Gallo Images." width="120" height="120">Influencer marketing - the value of micro vs macro-influencer marketing tacticsRirhandzu Shingwenyana from Sadmon lists ways in which nano, micro (mid-tiers) and macro influencer (mega influencers) are most effective and efficient when it comes to ROI...By Rirhandzu Shengwenyana 11 Apr 2019Does the influencer have a strong understanding of their target audience when asked?

If someone is creating images or anything that has a production element that you can use on your brand’s platforms, you should expect to pay hard costs as well as time fees.

Have you vetted their profile in detail? When selecting influencers, it is vitally important to research all aspects of their social media profiles.
