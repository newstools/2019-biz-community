This comes after the launch of Eutelsat’s hybrid satellite-OTT solution, Eutelsat CIRRUS, in September 2018. Eutelsat and Broadpeak plan to collaborate and share their technological resources in order to expand their portfolios of services for telecom operators, content creators and media groups. The two companies aim to respond to the rising demand for video content on all networks. The companies also plan on integrating satellite technology into the 5G generation of mobile phones.“We are delighted to partner with Broadpeak with whom we have been working since 2015. This association with a recognised and innovative leader in video content delivery solutions will enable us to expand our offer in this area,” said Jean Hubert-Lenotte, chief strategy and resources officer at Eutelsat. “Following the launch of Eutelsat CIRRUS last September, this investment reflects our strategy to accelerate the integration of IP and satellite technologies by expanding the portfolio of technological solutions available to our broadcast customers to distribute content to viewers across multiple channels,” added Hubert-Lenotte.“This investment by Eutelsat will enable us to strengthen our team and finance the strong growth of our business. We are very excited to develop our partnership with Eutelsat, with whom we will build next-generation services to deliver, optimize and monetise high-quality video experiences for end-users, whether at home or on the move,” said Broadpeak co-founder and chairman Jacques Le Mancq.Eutelsat launched the Eutelsat 7C on 21 June 2019. The satellite is said to provide high-powered broadcast services to markets in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. The satellite was lifted into space from Kourou in French Guinea by an Ariane 5 rocket.
