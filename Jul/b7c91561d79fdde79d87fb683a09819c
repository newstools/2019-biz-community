As cultural and social dynamics shift, we are beginning to see an environment where women can flourish, and demonstrate the value they offer to every industry and sector in the economy. We are proud to partner with Forbes Africa and believe that this initiative will help to create opportunities for women to reach their greatest potential.”The 2019 Forbes Woman Africa Leading Women Summit on March 8 saw supermodel, philanthropist, activist and cultural innovator, Naomi Campbell, headline the Durban event, alongside some of the most notable names in business, sports, politics and the arts.The Regional Forum will be a by-invitation-only gathering and will be managed and produced by ABN Event Productions.
