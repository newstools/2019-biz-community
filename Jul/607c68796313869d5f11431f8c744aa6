Melane set the scene for the two-day conference by quoting Jeff Bezos, who said if you make your customer happy in the physical world, he will tell 6 people, whereas if you make someone unhappy online, he will tell 6,000.The rise of social media complaints is prove of this as technology is everything today. Customer experience or CX is front and centre as a result because most people only bother to post online when they’ve had a bad experience.  Melane handed over to Toefy who describes himself as a 'tempered radical' and explains he originally worked as CEO of the CTICC, the venue for the Summit, for seven years before joining government. He's proud of the fact that few realise it's a 100% government-owned building as he worked to make it all about the experience economy, putting the customer at the centre of all they do. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/461557-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Western Cape campaign to boost investor confidence in the Cape" width="120" height="120">Western Cape campaign to boost investor confidence in the CapeThe campaign's key objective is to promote the Cape and South Africa internationally, by showcasing opportunities for investment across a variety of sectors...5 Oct 2018Toefy still remembers all the values the CICC strove for, and that awards were given for staff who demonstrated both integrity and excellence - something he feels would go a long way in government. So, when told he it was 'time to do his time' he joined government, he quickly realised that the need to upgrade customer experience with government has never been more essential. Government departments around the world still struggle in trying to offer quality results and turnaround times, with poor CX hampering project and mission success.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/460295-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#BI4Gov: Why Day Zero was less nudge effect, more kick-in-the-butt effect" width="120" height="120">#BI4Gov: Why Day Zero was less nudge effect, more kick-in-the-butt effectEver wondered how nudges turn into true behavioural change that benefits society?

They take challenges faced by businesses and investigate why a process that should take eight weeks or less suddenly takes 16 weeks.It's about meeting the expectations of customers rather than saying, 'these are the only tools in my toolbox, I'll have to send someone else to fix it for you.' We're working on filling the toolbox so we can go solve the problems faster.One way they’ve done so is by totally digitising the business plan approval process in partnership with the municipality, which was formerly an onerous process.According to Deloitte Insights' report on CX and citizen trends in government, Toefy says important aspects identified include listening to the customer, breaking down silos and turning all the data at their disposal into insights and intelligence. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/509272.jpg" alt="Unemployment rate rises" width="120" height="120">Unemployment rate risesSouth Africa's unemployment rate has risen to 29% during the second quarter of 2019, according to figures released by Statistician General Risenga Maluleke...1 day agoGiven the worrying unemployment statistics that have just been released, with unemployment at 38% if you include those no longer actively searching for employment and at over 50% for youth unemployment, it's fitting that Toefy says their current drive is to put a job into every home.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/456601-120x120.jpg?4" alt="Slide 161 of Youth Report (2018).

It's a step towards doing a better job of joining the dots on the values and getting government to function as a business.Unsiloing, working together, First ThursdaysThis ties in with the trend towards unsiloing - not just internally but also in the way businesses work.
