Hot Cares on Hot 91.9FM will take on the challenge to complete the project plan to open Oratile Primary School in January 2020. Talking to the “Mansfield in the Morning” team, school founder, Abram Kgari, discussed the need to build a primary school in the area. Oratile School of Excellence ECD Creche in Diepsloot was founded by Kgari and has been running successfully for the past 10 years.  Each year the Grade 0’s, who have completed the curriculum, celebrate their achievements and graduate with great excitement.  The reality is that there is no primary school in the area that can offer Grade 1 placement. Managing director, Lloyd Madurai says, “Hot Cares has been working with Abram Kgari, who is also the Chairman of the Diepsloot ECD Forum for the past year.  His passion for education, leadership and community involvement has inspired us to help meet the needs of these children and others and make his dream a reality. “Our intention is to work with partners and listeners and source donors whether it be in goods, services or financial assistance on 18th July. Throughout the day on Wednesday, 18th July, we will be calling on our Hot 91.9FM community to contribute and watch the dream of Oratile Primary School become a reality.  From Mansfield in the Morning to The Big Joburg Drive, companies and individuals will be invited to call in and make their contribution to the day,” Madurai adds. Call to action on Madiba Day The basic core elements for the school amount to approximately R500,000.  If you are looking to make a meaningful a difference this Mandela Day please consider joining this project by making a financial donation towards any of the following fundamental areas.
