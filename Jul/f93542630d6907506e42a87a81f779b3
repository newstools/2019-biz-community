The migration will lead to the release of some valuable spectrum currently used for analogue television broadcasting for the provision of mobile broadband services. Television stations will just be focused on content production whereas DGL and EXCAF will be on broadcasting.”The director general of Gambia Radio and Television Services (GRTS), Abdou Touray, indicated that the television broadcasting will be out of the system by 2020 with Gambia joining the rest of West Africa to become a success story. The national broadcaster is going to introduce more programmes that will include entertainment, religion and sports.Touray concluded, “With an existing analogue TV set, one only needs to buy an approved set top box (decoder) that complies with Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) receiver standard.”Source: NexTV.com.
