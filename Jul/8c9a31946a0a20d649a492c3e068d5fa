What makes you excited about brand communications? Brand communications allows our clients have meaningful connections with people. The power and ubiquity of modern media means that brands, now more than ever, can have a profound influence on consumers. It is up to us to help shape that influence into a positive force.3. What new skills and technologies do you see coming through in media and advertising right now?Technology is advancing at a rapid pace, so a firm grasp on innovation and trends is more important than ever. This combined with extreme human empathy and understanding is what will drive the industry forward.4.  What is unique about brand communications in Africa and the Middle East?Africa and the Middle East have long, perhaps unfairly, been the underdogs when it comes to this industry. We have exacerbated this by emulating  what the other regions do at the expense of our unique voice. I’m happy to say that the trend is shifting and we are seeing the value of infusing our work with stories, insights and the diversity of culture that is unique to us.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504553.jpg" alt="Tseliso Rangaka's views on Loeries 2019" width="625" height="417">5.

Why do we need to expose high school kids to the advertising industry as a possible future career path?The industry is its own best kept secret and has been attracting a very specific type of creative person. If we all agree that diversity is the fuel we need to run, then we must widen the aperture and look in places we haven’t traditionally searched for talent. High school kids need to be exposed to the industry in order for them to consider advertising as a potential career. 10. Why is it important for creative talent to strive for awards such as the Loeries?Advertising awards are the best way for creative talent to profile themselves within the industry.Shining on the Loeries stage is a really good way to build one’s brand as a creative.
