From Apex to EffieWhile Apex is about effectiveness, it is also a programme which supports education, specifically within the context of the industry. It was announced at the 2019 Apex awards ceremony that 8 bursaries were being awarded to deserving students from the AAA School of Advertising. This brings the total number of Apex bursaries awarded since the programme launched in 2010 to 88. Four bursaries were awarded to students from the AAA School’s Johannesburg campus and four to students from the Cape Town campus. Okaba ended off by saying:Tonight, we celebrated not only the efficacy our profession delivers, but also the future bright minds that are today’s students, and tomorrow’s award winners. It may be a sad farewell to Apex, but we look forward with great excitement to celebrating our local industry alongside our global peers as we introduce the Effie South Africa programme in 2020.
