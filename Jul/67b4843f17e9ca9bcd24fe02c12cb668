As retailers across the world map their way through the complicated landscape of e-commerce and digital transformation - going live with shopkaya.co.za was the next intentional move.From a commercial perspective, this platform forms part of Kaya’s strategic business unit. E-commerce is an integral part of a global buying and selling network that is crucial for us to partake in. Our website draws listeners from different parts of the world and it was important from a commercial point of view for Kaya to continue to expand its global reach.In South Africa, online retail adoption is steadily growing, with the majority of people still going the brick and mortar route where they can see, touch and feel whatever they are looking to buy - due to familiarity and trust. Over the years, Kaya FM has grown into a leading lifestyle authority, and we have proudly won the trust of Afropolitans through a range of lifestyle offerings such as Kaya Travel, Kaya TV and our bespoke events. Our online store offering allows us to further establish that trust with our audiences who can combine their love for travel and events with shopping online.Specifically curated to support local businessesWhen curating the website, it was important for Kaya FM to ensure that the platform supports the work of local craftsmanship, artisans and artists - while making this a space for them to continue to thrive. “We didn’t want to just put things we consider to be money spinners on the platform, instead we really wanted to focus on work that is being locally produced in South Africa," says Trevor Mwale, Kaya FM’s Financial Director. The other element is to have the products support what Kaya FM is doing as a business from an events point of view. Customers attending our picnics and outdoor live music events, for example, can accompany their ticket purchase with picnic baskets and blankets straight from the website. The website includes products produced by Tlou Collections, Leather Zulu, NtoZinhle Lifestyle and more.Kaya’s online retail website carries a clean, minimalist and interactive design allowing easy navigation for customers. The website’s capability extends beyond commerce to include marketing content like promotions, and customer service focused applications, such as cancellations, returns, refunds and delivery. This enhanced user experience includes a fully automated delivery experience, allowing the fulfilment and delivery of items to customers across the country.Building opportunities in a fragile economyWe at Kaya believe that some of the greatest business opportunities have been created during economical downtimes. “The timing of our launch during the current economic climate is deliberate”, comments Mwale. “We have decided to launch now as a way to say that we believe in South Africa, and we believe that the country will come right," he added, concluding that Kaya would continue to invest in highly skilled people from the continent by giving them access to opportunity.For more information visit shopkaya.co.za or connect with us on Facebook, Twitter or Instagram.
