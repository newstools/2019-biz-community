BEN & Co Designs is the first black-owned jewellery retailer in South Africa. They manufacture and retail high-end custom-made jewellery and take advantage of South Africa’s raw natural resources such as platinum, gold and diamonds. Ben & Co Designs struggles with cash flow as well as access to marketing and advertising.   Nedbank Business Ignite aims to empower entrepreneurs to carve out new markets and sustainable industries towards boosting the South African economy in new and innovative ways. Alan Shannon, Nedbank Head of Client Engagement, says Nedbank is proud to have been part of this amazing journey with Primedia’s 702 and Cape Talk, enabling entrepreneurs to come to the fore, as part of our longstanding efforts in unlocking the SME sector potential that is key to economic growth and job creation in South Africa. “As money experts, we use our financial expertise to do good and create a vibrant ecosystem which provide a rich set of development and support services that will enable businesses to grow. Whether in the early stages of running a business or embarking on a growth trajectory, entrepreneurs need the right banking partner, and Nedbank is focused on meeting their business needs. We wish our two winners well and hope their stories inspire others,” says Shannon. Fifteen finalists vied for the opportunity to go “beyond entrepreneurship” following weeks of profiling their businesses on-air and receiving expert advice from independent business growth specialist, Tshepo Phakhati, the founder of Kaello Business Hub.  The winner was decided by an expert panel of judges that included Phakhati; Alan Shannon, Head of Client Engagement at Nedbank; and Laura Clancy, Commercial Programming Manager at Primedia Broadcasting.  Bheki Ngema, founder of BEN & Co Designs, said, “The recognition and affirmation confirms that I am on the right track in terms of the career I have chosen. My products speaks for itself and I am most grateful for the fact that with this accolade from Nedbank and 702, more customers will be aware of my business. It is a great endorsement.”  He added that Kaello Business Hub helped him keep the business machine running because he is a jewellery designer but needs to wear various hats to grow the company and working with Tshepo Phakhati opened his mind to this concept.
