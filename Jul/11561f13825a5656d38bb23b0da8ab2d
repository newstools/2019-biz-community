As is the challenge faced by journalists who, on tight deadlines, have to constantly filter and determine the legitimate from the fake. The result among African audiences is an erosion of trust in the media, which has done little to curb their excessive exposure to fake news, and often knowing spread of it.Until now, the emphasis of the research has focused on the technology allowing fake news, as well as the motivations of those creating it, with little exploration into the voice and responsibility of ordinary citizens.It is with this in mind that Claire Rooney of BBC World Service Audiences, will be presenting a comparative study, Duty, Identity, Credibility: Fake news and the ordinary citizen in Kenya and Nigeria, at this year’s PAMRO All Media Research Conference, which will take place from 25 – 28 August 2019 at Hilton Mauritius Resort and Spa, Flic-en-Flac.Through immersion into the lives of ordinary citizens, the research which was compiled by Santanu Chakrabarti, Claire Rooney and Minnie Kweon of BBC World Service Audiences; and the teams at Flamingo and Synthesis, takes a deep dive into the social and cultural forces, as well as personal desires and aspirations and the influence these have in the spread and growth of ‘fake news’.The PAMRO conference is sponsored by DSTV Media Sales, Nielsen, GeoPoll, Ornico, Plus 94 and Ipsos.
