The same can be said for many other areas in which we can get rather passionate and heated. We are exceptionally hard on ourselves and often without merit.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507385-120x120.jpg?3" alt="Image via ." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: SuperSport's Springboks ad shows SA is stronger togetherIn a week where nation-building was top of mind as we both celebrated Mandela Day and mourned the passing of Johnny Clegg, a certain South African sport-supporting ad also gave us all the feels...By Leigh Andrews 2 days ago<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507033.jpg" alt="Sports as a business and a brand in Africa" width="120" height="120">Sports as a business and a brand in AfricaFans are choosing not to watch live football events, and instead are opting in increasing numbers for the 'intimacy' of their crystal clear digital flat TV screens, or not all, as recent attendances at AFCON showed...By Dr Victor Oladokun 17 Jul 2019I was fortunate enough to have travelled abroad – in April and again in June – to what we down this end of the continent and the rest of the world would refer to as a first-world country. Well yes, I guess that is the true definition however, in many aspects South Africa is streets ahead!Celebrate South Africa moreIn April, my wife and I drove about 3,500kms around Germany, a first-world country smaller than the Northern Cape. Yes, Germany would fit into the Northern Cape with a bit of space left around the edges.It is a beautiful country, however, the more we drove, the more I got to think how beautiful, yet underrated South Africa is. We have beautiful mountains, even higher than the beloved German Zugspitze.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504628-120x120.jpg?2" alt="5 places to see the Big 5 near Cape Town" width="120" height="120">5 places to see the Big 5 near Cape TownFrom the Winelands, mountain to the beaches, visitors to Cape Town are of course spoilt for choice, but many may not be aware that seeing the Big Five can easily be part of a trip to the Mother City...2 Jul 2019We have beautiful rivers and amazing wildlife, possibly some of the best in the world. Our road network is far superior, even to that of the overrated Autobahn in my opinion. With this said, why are we still so negative about the amazing country which we call home? Why do we slate ourselves so much?I recall one experience when I was making a purchase and, I kid you not, the person behind the counter whipped out one of those old credit card machines in which you would lay down the card, put a piece of paper over it and then push and pull that handle over the card. I think I last saw one of those when I was an eight-year-old kid and my mom was doing grocery shopping.At that moment, I recall turning to my wife and saying “did you just see that?” It dawned on me just how far ahead we are in so many aspects to that of the rest of the world – something we don’t seem to celebrate or ‘get’.SA is the best! Take our banking infrastructure as an example. Look at the likes of our online, money transfer and app functionality – in most cases, these far better than anywhere else in the world. The likes of DStv and the channels and programming that they provide is phenomenal in comparison to what I have experienced globally.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507609-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Kathleen Finch who is the chief lifestyle brands officer at Discovery.

Our diversity. If brands want to drive creativity and innovation, it's going to take a lot of work and patience...By Louise Hefer 13 Jun 2019As Hefer points out, diversity is also a massive strength of ours as a country, but one that we don’t always seem to take advantage of and use in our favour. Why is that? Have we become programmed to have a negative outlook?I would love our media houses to focus on the positive stories, the good that we as a country have to offer as opposed to always focusing on the negative. After all, we have a lot to celebrate.A HUGE Congratulations to Busiswa & Moonchild for appearing on the New Beyoncé (The Lion King) Album.

Let’s focus on all the positive aspects in order to make a meaningful difference.It is only in this that we as a country will realise our true potential and move forward to greater things that we as a nation can deliver on. Come on South Africa, let’s back one another!
