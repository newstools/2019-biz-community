It’s also the reason why we’re helping a young woman get her ‘varsity degree through University of Johannesburg. If she graduates, she’ll be the first in her family to do so. That type of change can alter the fortunes of future generations. And it feels really good to think you’re part of something positive when there’s enough bad news to fell a forest.”“Mark Anderson, the CEO of BirdLife South Africa, is my brother and Jacques van Wyk is our client,” says Michelle Oelschig, co-owner of Scarlet Letter. “Those are the obvious reasons we contributed to Jacques’ campaign. But another reason is because of a run we did on the banks of the Tugela earlier this year.”Oelschig and Holmes are keen trail runners who participated in a two-day event organised by Zingela Trail Run, which supports vulture conservation. “We didn’t realise the impact of poaching and other dangers to vultures and raptors in degrading biodiversity areas before the conservation presentation at Zingela,” says Oelschig. “Who knew that when vultures scavenge carcasses they perform a valuable public service?” says Holmes. “People frequently contract diseases from dead animals. Vultures clean that up but obviously not when they’re poached or their habitats destroyed. Vultures are just one example of why it’s important to support conservation and they’re also the path that led to our supporting Jacques and his Kilimanjaro mission to raise funds for BirdLife.” Van Wyk has undertaken the challenge because he has been a passionate birder for 15 years, he is turning 50 and celebrating by taking on the challenge to summit Mount Kilimanjaro, and wants to unite the two events to help conservation. He is self-funding his expedition and will donate all funds raised to BirdLife unencumbered so the non-profit organisation can meet its many ongoing funding requirements. Van Wyk has already raised R62,000, primarily from Ricoh SA’s business partners. Please offer your support by heading to http://www.imaginechange.co.za/summit/ and smashing that Donate button.
