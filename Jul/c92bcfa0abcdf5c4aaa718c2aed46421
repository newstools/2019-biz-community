Her other portfolio-topping work includes: “Mama Said Knock You Out”, a spot from Chase featuring Serena Williams; and #OneGoodReason, an anti-smoking campaign for CVS, which was subsequently praised by Michelle Obama.Rewinding beyond her advertising career, that industry sparkle may come from having been born in Libya to Sudanese parents, and lived in Egypt and Yemen before immigrating to the United States at age 11, where she received degrees in marketing and advertising from the University of North Texas, where she graduated magna cum laude. She spent four years at BBDO New York, before moving to 72andSunny in 2019.That cultural nuance and standing up for big issues is important to Ahmed is an understatement, as she’s been recognised for her personal stand-out factor, having featured in such global industry standards as Forbes’ 30 under 30 in marketing and advertising list for 2019 as well as The Drum’s ’50 under 30 US Women in Advertising’.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/502596.jpg" alt="A new attitude: Unstereotyping advertising" width="120" height="120">A new attitude: Unstereotyping advertisingAs the Women's Decade 2010-2020 of the African Union draws to a close, women the world over are standing firm in their push for gender equality - and they want men to walk and work with them...Issued by Loeries 20 Jun 2019She clearly understands what drives the creatives who thrive in this industry, so who better to serve as the 2019 Loeries jury president for Film and Radio?

What’s the biggest trend in advertising that you expect to see from this year’s entries? I think we will continue to see socially conscious work, but I think it will run a wider gamut of media outside of just film, with more experiential work and initiatives within brands..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}With so much advertising ‘noise’ out there, it takes a lot to stand out from the crowd.
