Because of the challenges of the country and the benefits of creative expression, South Africa was chosen as the pilot country and this year marks 15 years of Room 13. The programme launched in 2005 with two schools – Sapebuso Primary in Soweto, Johannesburg and Mmulankgoro Intermediate in Botshabelo near Bloemfontein.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507066-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#CSIMonth: Education initiatives can transform CSI into social justice" width="120" height="120">#CSIMonth: Education initiatives can transform CSI into social justiceDespite corporate social investment activities becoming more common among South African businesses in recent years, they're still seldom treated as little more than a box-ticking exercise...By Dion Reddy 17 Jul 2019.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How does the initiative use art to help the children develop their self-esteem and sense of purpose?At Room 13, we believe that every child is an artist and has creative capabilities. We embrace and welcome all children interested in becoming part of the programme. This ethos of belonging creates a safe place for our learners, where they are encouraged to express themselves. Through practice, our roomies learn and experiment with different art mediums which help them develop confidence as their skills grow. Creative activities are used as a tool to investigate, realise and communicate rather than a means of reproduction.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507618-625x325.jpg?2" alt="#CSIMonth: How Room 13 and TBWA inspire kids with the arts" width="625" height="325">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What kinds of activities does the initiative offer?Because Room 13 strives to be a place where our learners are free to express themselves, the programme does not have a curriculum and operates on ‘open learning’. Each studio is led by an artist-in-residence who drives the daily activities based on a combination of their skills and the interests of the children. Activities range from drawing, painting, sculpture, printing and etching as well as theatre, poetry and performance.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/505125-120x120.jpg?2" alt="21 emerging artists to showcase work at Zeitz Mocaa" width="120" height="120">21 emerging artists to showcase work at Zeitz MocaaThe City of Cape Town's Arts and Culture Branch has given 21 emerging artists from around the city the opportunity to showcase their work at the award-winning Zeitz Mocaa art gallery...4 Jul 2019.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Room 13 is currently running at six disadvantaged schools across three provinces. Are there any plans on expanding to other parts of the country?To take Room 13 forward, we need to take our time and ensure that the project has taken root by adapting to the realities and priorities of the communities in which it lives. While Room 13 SA already has potential studios earmarked, we have to remember that it took 10 years for the programme to mature from one studio into a network with studios in UK, England, Nepal and South Africa. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}For #MandelaMonth, you’re running a stationery drive to collect art supplies and basic stationery.

Our wish list includes regular items such as erasers, sharpeners, drawing pencils, sketch pads and charcoal, paints and canvasses to more specialist items for silk screening and lithography.

Each studio selects its management team from the learners in the programme, who make decisions on how best to run the studio&#x2019;s activities with guidance from the artist-in-residence. <br><br>One of the key objectives is to encourage the learners to develop business and entrepreneurial skills through the day-to-day management of their studios, exhibitions and the selling of their creative products. <br><br><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A sneak peak into the daily practice at Amohelang Room13.<br>Although it's only for a few days, we're going to miss this daily practice as schools break for the holidays. <a href="https://t.co/JdAfuQlqdZ">pic.twitter.com/JdAfuQlqdZ</a></p>&#x2014; Room 13 South Africa (@Room13_SA) <a href="https://twitter.com/Room13_SA/status/978939197284372480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 28, 2018</a></blockquote><br><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">Our studios have a proven record of keeping young people engaged in education and are recognised as a means of addressing some of the most compelling problems facing young people, schools and society..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}As part of the Inspiration Day, professionals across the creative industry are invited to share their journeys and enlighten the Room 13 learners on the career opportunities available. How are these professionals selected?Professionals are suggested by the artists-in-residence based on the learners’ interests or are invited in efforts to expose the learners how creative skills can translate into various career paths. We always aim to have a variety of people from different career paths so that each session leaves the learners more informed and inspired than the last. Because Room 13 is an arts-based programme, there is a heavy focus on creative careers..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How can we get involved?There are so many ways to support Room 13, depending on one’s capacity. For those who prefer to donate; you could make Room 13 a beneficiary on your Woolworths MySchool card or donate via our backabuddy account or sponsor a skills workshop. Another way would be to support the business of Room 13 by purchasing their canvas art and drawings some of which have been turned into postcards and t-shirts.
