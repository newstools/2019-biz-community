So, it’s crucial for business success to understand the hidden influences of user’s decision-making process in the modern digital space.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504988-120x120.jpg" alt="Being deeply digital" width="120" height="120">Being deeply digitalThe truth is that the marketing fraternity hasn't helped itself in defining what exactly digital marketing is and where it fits in...By Jacques du Bruyn 3 Jul 2019The influence of Generation Z – the first generation of true digital natives – is expanding and influencing the social media trends too. According to McKinsey, members of Gen Z are people born from 1995 to 2010 who from their earliest youth have been exposed to the internet, social networks and mobile systems.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504480-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The power of social media and influence in today's 4th Industrial Revolution" width="120" height="120">The power of social media and influence in today's 4th Industrial RevolutionWith the advent of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, marketing communication tools and practices need to be re-examined to aggressively create power and influence of products, services, and brands through social media and digital marketing...By Nokwanda Ndashe 1 Jul 2019There is no chance to increase ROI for your business success today if you don't spread your voice in the digital world and social networks, in particular. Businesses should adjust their marketing strategies to the needs and requirements of Gen Z since this fastly growing part of our society is dictating the future trends of the digital space and, therefore, new marketing trends too.Mistake #1. Underestimating the power of social networksSocial media penetration is ever-increasing worldwide. According to Statista, the pervasiveness of social media will increase to over 3.02 billion users worldwide by 2021.Considering all other pieces of the marketing pie, social media marketing is a big slice today. The right content published in the right moment will help you build customer loyalty and bring plenty of other benefits to the business. You should just learn how to optimise your content to the customer’s needs.Social networks are a powerful tool of engagement able to spread the word of your brand around the globe within minutes. Social media is also helpful in user experience research. Mistake #1 is underestimating the power of social networks and not making enough effort in producing high-quality content.Mistake #2. Not understanding your target audienceExplore your target audience as you’d like to explore the mind of your loved one. Discover their wants and habits.Google Analytics can give you a good insight into your target audience peculiarities. Consequently, you’ll get a better understanding of people you’re creating social media content for.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/488021-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#SeamlessSA: Ink Eze's 5 actionable tips to grow an online community" width="120" height="120">#SeamlessSA: Ink Eze's 5 actionable tips to grow an online communityNigerian entrepreneur Ink Eze knows how to grow an online community: her wedding community Bella Naija Weddings has over three million followers on Instagram...By Maroefah Smith 19 Mar 2019Moreover, you shouldn’t stop your customer persona research after investigating the cold data. Stats are an old good friend, however, don't fully trust them. Sometimes, you should act like a marketer from the 19th century: check information “manually”.Exploring your random follower's profile “manually”, not by using any analytics tool, you will gain a new view at your customer persona. You will get a specific kind of information, which you wouldn’t get from any automatically generated stats.Boujee Bowl. That’s it. That’s the tweet. pic.twitter.com/9Ujc3syFlc— NandosSA (@NandosSA) July 11, 2019It’s almost transparent, but it is still important for effective marketing. It feels like your customer’s mood.On the fans’ profiles, you can learn about their lifestyles, tastes, habits and even food preferences. That will help you adjust your content to the needs and peculiarities of these people. You might be surprised, but such data can give birth to the unique marketing idea that will be understood by your target audience.Mistake #3. Not offering real value to peopleDon’t underestimate people. They understand if your content is good or not.No matter, whether your prospective customers are skateboarders, housewives or business people: individuals always feel the quality intuitively. Be interested in producing great content offering value to people.The content bringing value doesn’t mean only tips, news or talks about new product features. You can post user-generated content. It shows appreciation for fans that reached out and connected with you.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/505932-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Want your customers to trust you?

Email is one of the most powerful tools you haveEarning customers' trust is key when it comes to achieving success as an organisation. Those that get it right stand to reap massive rewards, not least because loyal customers spend more...By Ross Sibbald 9 Jul 2019The “value” I’m talking about is the brand’s attention to a customer. Let people feel that a company cares about how they feel using a product or service. The more you engage with your fans, the more likely they are to share new photos with you.User-generated content will enrich the brand’s social media page with the fresh visuals, give more engagement and start the interaction chain between a company and its customers.One more tip on the social media content: dear entrepreneurs, don’t try to produce visuals for the cheapest price. Bad product images are almost equal to the brand’s fail on social networks. The better your product “looks”, the more likely your brand’s voice will be heard by others on the social channels.Mistake #4. Not adding a pinch of novelty Life means dynamics. Your marketing should reflect the changes your customers are experiencing. Thus, a marketing strategy needs to be timely injected by a dose of changes. Otherwise, you will not survive in the market.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506173-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Monique Claassen, director of media and digital insights at Millward Brown and Jane Ostler, global head of media, presenting at Kantar's Cape Town 'Roadmap to Media Effectiveness' event." width="120" height="120">Context conquers platform: Connecting with the new-world consumerAhead of Kantar's 'best liked ads of 2018' reveal, two sessions were hosted in Cape Town and Johannesburg on the art and science of media success, with a special focus on finding the right mix of channels and creative to #GetMediaRight...By Leigh Andrews 11 Jul 2019If you do not accept changes, the changes will not accept you. Experiment with the new approaches, try to constantly add a pinch of novelty into your social media content.To be wrong is human, all of us make mistakes. Don’t be afraid of doing them. You should take risks if you want to develop the unique and memorable ‘voice’ of your brand.Mistake #5. Not being aware of "malicious tags" on Instagram Since Instagram is the giant among other social networks, let’s pay special attention to it. I’d like to share with you truly new information on the Instagram system, which I’ve crystallised after providing marketing services for companies across different industries.         View this post on Instagram           This #WorldEmojiDay we want you to tell us your sauciest stories in the comments below using only emojis. �� And go! �� A post shared by  Durex South Africa (@durexsouthafrica) on Jul 17, 2019 at 1:32am PDT Don’t use any kind of hashtags that contain words like “porn”, “addicted”, “sex”, “fetish”, “sexy” or something similar. Even if your post is not related to any of these topics, but it has the hashtags like “#foodporn”, “#heelfashionfetish”, “#addicted-to-food”, “#sexy_dress” etc., your profile may get to a blacklist generated by Instagram bots.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/505000-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Instagram, the new marketing hub for business growth" width="120" height="120">Instagram, the new marketing hub for business growthThis is the time that businesses need to capitalise on brand expansion and business growth - and social media platforms - when used correctly - can assist. Refilwe Monyai, account manager at Orange Ink gives tips and tricks on how to get Instagram right...By Refilwe Monyai 4 Jul 2019There are different scenarios of what may happen further. The worst scenario: your profile will be completely banned. The better scenario: you’ll be able to post on Instagram, but you’ll not be able not to add new hashtags for a period of time ranging from one to two weeks up to three to four months. You will not be able also to edit the recently published posts anymore.Consequently, you may lose the chance to get new followers that could come through new hashtags. Moreover, Instagram may start sending less traffic to your profile because it’s blacklisted.What to do? The only thing is to wait until the Instagram system will update a ‘blacklist’ after some time and give the blacklisted profiles another chance to function as previously.If you’ve faced such a situation, I recommend not to stop your activity on Instagram, just be careful using the hashtags.As I’ve mentioned before, err is human. But to make mistakes and learn from them is the privilege of the smart human. I hope my experience gained from making these mistakes will help you improve your social media marketing strategy and establish the distinguishable and beautiful voice of your brand. The voice that will give pleasure to the target audience interacting with your content.
