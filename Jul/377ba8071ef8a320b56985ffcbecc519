The informal and unique ways in which we can share stories and influence culture; helping to redefine concepts of self-worth, beauty and fulfilment.  6.

What are the tools of your trade? Creativity, strategy and an ability to act in the interests of others, not just yourself.  8. Who is getting it right in your industry? Editors and content creators who have stopped trying to make their readers fit into a specific mould, but rather cater for the different ways in which their readers identify and express themselves. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475040-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Dali Tembo, managing director of Instant Grass International." width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: The year we rethink segmentationIf there's one thing we love as marketers, it's squeezing ever-evolving consumers into deceptively neat PowerPoint boxes. Too many customer segmentation reports are based on over-simplified, outdated data - just ask 'Bargaining Busi' and 'Premium Pam'...By Dali Tembo 15 Jan 20199. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. The industry still has a very limited view of beauty and success.Lack of digital innovation.

Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. The big buzzword is: disruption/disruptors – we’re all looking at ways in which we can change the status quo and innovate. Without this, the industry will die. I’m constantly saying/asking myself three things: What’s the long-term strategy or pay off for this?Will your reader like this? Focus on your own race!12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? Weirdly enough, it’s always while I’m driving to and from work. This is strange because I detest driving and am usually in a hurry to get it over with!13. What’s your secret talent/party trick? I can sew, from pattern-making to the final product.

Are you a technophobe or a technophile? Definitely a technophile. I worked as a digital editor for a long while and discovered a lot about how print and digital can co-exist. It isn’t the doom and gloom that’s been forecast for print.Being technophobes as leaders in media is the problem. We can’t capitalise on something we fear or disregard. 15. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? Lots of photos. Instagram is the only social media platform I’m really active on.

Lots of music and food delivery apps. 16. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry? Focus on your work and let it speak for you.
