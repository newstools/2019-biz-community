With increased attention being placed on Singularity’s various corporate education initiatives and faculty members by media, the intention is to ensure that journalists always have the latest content available at their fingertips, without the delays of manual requests. Housed conveniently within the SingularityU South Africa mobile app, media have access to both the same content that programme delegates have, as well as their own tailored media stream. Within the media stream, journalists can obtain speaker announcement videos, event photographs, PR photographs, articles, press releases, speaker biographies and more, with real time updates. The Exponential Africa show, which focusses on thought leaders in the field of exponential innovation can be viewed in the app, as each episode goes live. Media are also able to live chat with the SingularityU publicist for immediate support as well as each other, giving them a collaborative communication platform for very first time ever. The SingularityU South Africa Summit 2019 will take place at the Kyalami Grand Prix and Conference Centre, in Johannesburg on 16 and 17 October 2019. Now in its third year, and promising to be exponentially bigger than previous years, this future-focussed event will take Singularity’s mission to use new technologies to help solve the global challenges further, by placing a specific focus on future proofing Africa. Speakers that have already been announced include Sivan Ya’ari, Ramez Naam, Andres De Leon, Kim Hullet, Suzanne Gildert (pHD), and Kris Øostergaard. More speakers will be announced shortly. “While we focus on future proofing Africa, and providing a platform to share how technologies can solve the various global challenges, it only felt fitting that we innovate in the way that the media access our materials, by making it as easy and convenient as possible” said Mic Mann, co-CEO of SingularityU South Africa.  “We value our relationships with media tremendously and are thankful for their support in helping us take SingularityU further in South Africa,” said Shayne Mann, co-CEO of SingularityU South Africa.  The third annual SingularityU South Africa Summit will focus on creating a collaborative and more economically-inclusive future, whereby partnerships and deals can be conceptualised and developed across the continent. Networking opportunities will allow attendees to connect with SingularityU faculty members and alumni. Exhibitors will present breakthrough ideas and investment opportunities that will run alongside the summit. Save the Date for the third annual SingularityU South Africa Summit  When: 16 and 17 October 2019Where: Kyalami Theatre on the Track, JohannesburgCost: Early adopter tickets: R16,650 (sold out), Standard tickets: R18,500, Late mover tickets: R20,350.
