Ever since its banning in South Africa in 2000, packaging has been the only remaining avenue open to tobacco manufacturers to differentiate their products.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/445352.jpg" alt="What can we expect from the new Tobacco Bill and its ripple effect?" width="120" height="120">What can we expect from the new Tobacco Bill and its ripple effect?The proposed Control of Tobacco Products and Electronic Delivery Systems Bill is intended to replace the 1993 Tobacco Control Act, but is imposing a number of highly restrictive regulations...By Andrew Neumann 18 Jun 2018Plain and simple However, that avenue looks to be coming to an end with plans to implement a new ruling requiring tobacco manufacturers to use only plain packaging. The latter regulation requires manufacturers to remove all branded features from external packaging with only the brand name written in a standardised format, font size and colour.South Africa will not be the first country to implement this regulation: Australia, France, the UK and Ireland have already implemented plain packaging for tobacco products with a several other countries intending to follow suit.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507917-120x120.jpg?2" alt="What do South Africans think about SA's proposed Tobacco Bill?" width="120" height="120">What do South Africans think about SA's proposed Tobacco Bill?The general public views the burgeoning growth of illegal cigarette sales in the country as of far greater importance to address, than Government's proposed plain packaging for tobacco products...23 Jul 2019In Australia, the introduction of plain packaging has had very limited success in reducing sales with critics arguing that two consecutive tax hikes in all likelihood played a more significant role. In South Africa too, there is little evidence that a ban on tobacco advertising reduced the number of smokers in the country.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/476268-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Plain packaging for tobacco: what other countries can learn from the UK's experience" width="120" height="120">Plain packaging for tobacco: what other countries can learn from the UK's experienceBans on tobacco advertising, promotion, sponsorship and open display in shops in the UK encouraged tobacco companies to make the pack the hero. So they opposed plain packaging and claimed there was no evidence...By Nathan Critchlow and Danielle Mitchell 4 Jan 2019The International Advertising Association (IAA) has argued that any proposals to introduce plain packaging on a product that is legal to sell and legal to buy sets a dangerous precedent and that its enforcement for tobacco, however well-meaning, could all too easily be expanded into other products with far-reaching and unforeseen consequences.The reality is that plain packaging for tobacco products is unlikely to reduce the number of smokers. The only way to stop people smoking is to implement a total ban on the sale of tobacco products, although even this is unlikely to succeed as it would inevitably simply give rise to a greater number of illicit tobacco products sales.         View this post on Instagram           ��Media release: New Studies Confirm Tobacco Plain Packaging Failure �� We have today welcomed newly released independent studies which confirm what the ATA has long argued: that tobacco plain packaging has not significantly reduced smoking prevalence in Australia, has acted as a distraction that has discouraged the implementation of more effective tobacco control measures, and has motivated a taxpayer-funded international push for this failed policy by the World Health Organisation (WHO).

Similarly, there is no argument that marketing and branding can skew perceptions of products.Whether removing all brand differentiators on product packaging is the solution is doubtful and will likely to result in consumers buying purely on price.The challenge then would be for brand owners to find ways of differentiating their product based purely on quality, a tall order in most instances.
