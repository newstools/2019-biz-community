Also all electronics could be controlled by voice. Instead of having to turn it on, you could say “Something turn on”. – Enoch, 10 years old Hulley said this specific prediction is bang on the money. First, there’s the fact that having connected homes and smart devices costs less now than it did five years ago, so the cost will likely reduce further as the technology becomes more available. The opportunity for marketers and brands is to get inside people’s lives and solve their problems from the moment they wake up. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490657.jpg" alt="New voices in voice-led tech" width="120" height="120">New voices in voice-led techShould we be optimising for African languages?

Brand experience Q&A quickiesAnswering questions from the audience on how to stay ahead of the curve in a constantly evolving digital world, Hulley said her top tip is to make an effort to constantly upskill both yourself and your business. Partner with learning academies and also attend webinars and industry networking talks, chat to others and get used to the ‘fast learning’ opportunities of today. Hulley also spoke to the sticky topic of whether or not to shift your brand identity. To determine how often to do so, she reminded attendees that the reason your business is in operation is to solve a specific challenge for a customer group, and to deliver on a brand promise. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/486988-120x120.jpg?2" alt="YPO member James Barty - also ACA chairperson and CEO of King James Group." width="120" height="120">#YPOEdge: James Barty on brand humanity and doing good business, beyond ticking the 'CSI box'Leigh Andrews speaks to King James founder and YPO member James Barty about what he gains from his involvement in YPO and how all businesses can make a better impact...By Leigh Andrews 14 Mar 2019So, if you receive a crucial insight that reflects on that specific challenge and changing the way you solve that problem, you’d need to consider it carefully as a brands’ identity should be taken as seriously as you do your personal identity. Be clear on the specific values your brand stands for, and how you connect authentically with your customers.Asked about social influencers and whether they add to or take away from a brand’s credibility, Hulley set the context by stating she’s a great believer in a good brief, no matter the action required. If you know what you want for your brand, social media influencers can be a key part of the marketing mix. Finding those who genuinely build on that relationship with your consumers is the ideal.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/499688-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Santa Claus for Coca-Cola..." width="120" height="120">#YouthMonth: How to spot fake influencers on social mediaInfluencer marketing is an especially hot topic as we enter #YouthMonth, but do your research before you rush in as the quickest way to waste your time and money is to spend it on the wrong people...By Leigh Andrews 4 Jun 2019If your brand is disconnected or the influencer doesn’t understand the objectives you’re trying to reach, that’s when things go wrong. That’s why Hulley says it’s important to keep in touch with how your audience is responding to those influencers, and to create as clear a brief as possible so that the influencer better understands your brand and you better understand their power.Touching on how to measure the success of brand experiences, Hulley said you can only manage what you set up to measure. You simply can’t measure your brand’s impact if you’re not set up to do so. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/491513-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Revealed: What holistic PR measurement looks like today" width="120" height="120">Revealed: What holistic PR measurement looks like todayLauren Chavez, director at Atmosphere Communications and executive earned media director at King James Group, which came out tops at the IAB's #Bookmarks2019 for digital excellence, was the presenter of Meltwater's most recent monthly webinar, on why 'the rands no longer make sense' for PR.
