Though this will be his first visit to Durban he has visited SA numerous times, so who better to judge on the 2019 Loeries’ Integrated campaign, Film & Radio, and Radio Craft work, under Radio and DStv Film jury president Nedal Ahmed? <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/505146-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nedal Ahmed, senior copywriter at 72andSunny, Amsterdam and this year's Loeries Film and Radio jury president." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: "Celebrate creativity that touches on everyday culture" - Nedal AhmedWith the year's biggest international award shows done and dusted, I chatted to the international jury presidents ahead of the upcoming Loeries Creative Week. Next in the series is this year's Film and Radio jury president Nedal Ahmed, also senior copywriter at 72andSunny, Amsterdam...By Leigh Andrews 5 Jul 2019I chatted to Deb about regional differences in creative work, his judging expectations, and more….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How does work from your region differ to what you’ve seen from SA?It’s amazing to see how creative work in SA is always evolving and adapting to the ever-changing needs of the consumer landscape.One great example is the Nando’s “More South African Flavour” spot. The ad questions the surplus of “Afrofuturism” on our screens.It questions the way we celebrate the diversity and beauty of Africa. Should the portrayals always be so bizarrely over the top?Do consumers really see the same Africa that is being shown by brands?The Nando’s approach puts the consumer at the centre of the campaign and beautifully weaves the product into the narrative.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1801/424664-120x120.jpg" alt="Screengrabs from the ad." width="120" height="120">#OrchidsandOnions: We can fix our $h!t and we can still make great ads... but let's lose the political correctness, pleaseTiming is something which always sets Nando's ads apart from the rest. Sure, the ads are funny - and in a way we, as South Africans, instinctively understand... but it is their timing which gives them their humour...By Brendan Seery 9 Jan 2018Such bold work that goes against the ordinary is quite literally food for thought for both brands and agencies.Kenya is also doing some great work creatively. We have no shortage of passion or imagination and in recent times, Kenyan work has been celebrated and awarded on the global stage.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/502870.jpg" alt="Back-to-back wins for Dentsu Aegis Network at the African Cristal Awards" width="120" height="120">Back-to-back wins for Dentsu Aegis Network at the African Cristal AwardsRecognising the best creative, media and digital work across the continent, Dentsu Aegis Network SSA won 25 awards including the prestigious African Cristal Media Network of the Year Award for the second year running...Issued by Dentsu Aegis Network 21 Jun 2019However, what we do lack is enough culturally inspired work. Authentically Kenyan work. I believe that this kind of work helps a brand in activating its purpose, signalling a point of difference and above all, embedding itself in people’s lives.Don’t get me wrong, there have been examples of work like this in Kenya in the past, but there has always been a trend of looking for inspiration to the West, while all we really need to do is look really hard at the consumer and the ideas, customs, achievements of our country and society as a whole..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Definitely. What is unique about brand communications in Africa and the Middle East? The shift towards culturally and socially relevant work has been a breath of fresh air. We’ve started to move from safe to provocative by relooking at tradition and questioning the status quo. It is an extremely exciting time to be alive!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}That it is! What in particular makes you excited about brand communications? What new skills and technologies do you see coming through in media and advertising right now? The evolution of data and what we can do with it. It has made us start rethinking not only how marketing gets made within marketing departments and in partnership with agencies, but also how it lives and breathes in the wild. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1508/304010-120x120.jpg" alt="Math men vs mad men?

I won’t just be looking at innovation. I will be looking at how creatively a piece of work has crafted a solution to a problem. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Do you think the tenets of a successful media campaign are universal? What makes a campaign work in your country? Definitely not. I feel that more and more we’ll see that the strength of a creative campaign lies not in how well it can be controlled but in how rapidly others can build on it.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/494453.jpg" alt="Work showcase: getting leadership buy-in" width="120" height="120">Work showcase: getting leadership buy-inYash Deb of Isobar Kenya shares how leadership buy-in helped connect one client to a new audience...Issued by Dentsu Aegis Network 29 Apr 2019When it comes to Kenya, I feel that campaigns that build strategies around local culture, the addressable consumer and those that are brave enough to cede control, win.These elements help personalise the brand message to the individual consumer and make them the champions of the campaign..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Lastly, what are you most looking forward to from Loeries Creative Week 2019?
