Across all generations, key omnichannel touchpoints are an expectation, not an option.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506826-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Retail in 2030: AI, IoT, big data, and omnichannel as teenagers" width="120" height="120">Retail in 2030: AI, IoT, big data, and omnichannel as teenagersWill technologies like AI mean the end of human engagement and shopping in a physical retail store?

The overwhelming majority of consumers – 91% – suggest that omnichannel experiences are either important or critical, with 29% suggesting that companies should be “where I want, when I want, ready to share and communicate how I expect.”Among the key generational shifts identified by the study:When it comes to channels consumers can’t live without<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507338.jpg" alt="85% of global consumers want omnichannel experiences - finds CMO Council study" width="248" height="514">, all but Gen Z reached for their phones. For Gen Z, they simply cannot part with social, which they are likely accessing on their phone.Social emerges as a key channel of discovery and influence for millennials and Gen Z, while Gen X (born between 1965-1980), boomers (born between 1946-1964) and the silent generation (born between 1928-1945) rely on websites to discover new products and they admit that web is also the biggest influence on buying decisions.Think only Gen Z is an open book? Think again. Across all generations, the majority of consumers are comfortable sharing some data with brands, especially consumers in Europe who have been well-educated about data and its uses and benefits. In exchange, consumers expect to understand what is collected and how it is used. Specifically, millennials are slightly more inclined to share more data in exchange for better personalisation.Everyone gets frustrated when asked to re-start conversations with a brand after they shift to a new channel. But boomers hold a grudge, as much as 78%– the highest across all ages – say that this frustration has led them to question why they do business with the brand at all.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507339.jpg" alt="85% of global consumers want omnichannel experiences - finds CMO Council study" width="454" height="607">“It is easy to assume that a single generation will embrace or reject a single channel as we see individual adoption rates soar or plummet year over year,” noted Liz Miller, SVP of Marketing with the CMO Council. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495252-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Retailers must leverage online and offline tactics to succeed" width="120" height="120">Retailers must leverage online and offline tactics to succeedNow that we're in the ninth year of what's dramatically been dubbed 'the retail apocalypse', local retailers have felt the pinch...By Michael Zahariev 6 May 2019“But we also live in an age where we are seeing incredible creativity being applied across both digital and physical channels – where digitally native brands like Google, Casper and Harry’s Shave Club are looking to disrupt consumer behavior and consideration patterns with beautiful printed pieces pulled from a mailbox and extend the reach and impact of email, mobile and in-store experiences. We can’t afford to ignore or discount physical experiences by assuming digital is the only channel of engagement. Consumers are not focused on channel. They are focused on their own needs, requirements and preferences. The call to action is to meet them in their moments and not in ours,” she adds.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507348-625x422.jpg" alt="Harry's Shaving Club's iPhone app." width="625" height="422">Harry's Shaving Club's iPhone app.Build-your-own-adventure way to hearts (and wallets) One example of how channels are evolving to increase influence and disrupt behaviours can be seen in consumer reaction and reliance on video. Consumers indicate that control, personalisation and the ability to “build-their-own-adventure” were all ways to their hearts and wallets.Nearly half of respondents (48%) said they want to engage with videos that reflected specific products and services they own or are interested in. Another 43% stated they would like video to be more interactive, allowing them to decide what information they can view and when. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/483847-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Boost sales with omnichannel retail in 3 simple steps" width="120" height="120">Boost sales with omnichannel retail in 3 simple stepsIt's no secret that local retailers are having a torrid time.

The amount of data and emerging technologies available today make this an attainable goal for our industry. But it’s those brands who embrace these capabilities that will stand out as leaders in the future.”Read the full report here.
