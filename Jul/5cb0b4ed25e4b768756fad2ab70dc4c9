Just think back to the heady days of the Fifa 2010 World Cup held here in SA, when every day was a chance to proudly sing the anthem together and unite. Wherever we were.The latest ad by SuperSport does a good job of tapping into that spirit of camaraderie, in enticing viewers to watch the Springboks take on the world at the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan from 20 September to 2 November, live on SuperSport.Stronger Together is for Springboks and ordinary South Africans‘Stronger Together’ is similar to Nike’s purpose-driven 'Dream Crazy' campaign that’s winning awards all over the world. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506446-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Screen grab from Nike's 'Never Stop Winning' ad." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Nike just does it again - this time standing strong for equal payNike's recent run of 'Dream Crazy' ads have won more than just global recognition for their strong push towards inclusion and equality - they're also proving that brands really do make more consumer impact when they put consumer's causes first and foremost...By Leigh Andrews 15 Jul 2019It’s a TV commercial that captures not only the pride, effort and emotion that goes into becoming a Springbok but also mirrors the pride and joy of ordinary South Africans in their country.Springbok captain Siya Kolisi says in the video caption on YouTube:This is not just a Springbok campaign – it is a South African campaign to galvanise the public not just behind their team but behind their country. It’s not just the Springboks who rise early, work hard, sweat and shed blood on the field. There are millions of South Africans, hard-working everyday people – whose names we will never know – who rise early, doing what they have to do so that they can provide for their families. This campaign is for you – the taxi driver, mine worker, blue-collar worker, nurses and doctors, teachers, engineers, students – all ordinary South Africans who do what they do to make this country stronger.More than just ‘don’t forget to support the team’, the message is one of hope and unity – and a reminder that we really are stronger when we stand together: Kolisi is certainly standing behind this message himself - he was injured for the Springboks' match this weekend but still supported the players by handing out water on the field.Rassie Erasmus, national director of rugby, adds on the SuperSport website that as much as their focus is obviously on preparing and playing to win matches, the squad is attuned to the national sentiment and is "lifted" when they feel the nation is behind them.“It’s lekker when we feel the country behind us,” said Erasmus.We certainly are, with this ad.
