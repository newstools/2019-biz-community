He also assures that no other business in the Econet Group is affected by this administration process.On the other hand, Hundah said that Kwesé TV would continue to operate its free-to-air business in the rest of Africa as normal.To recall, in March, ICASA awarded Kwesé a free to air TV broadcasting licence. This licence was meant to compete with broadcasters like SABC and etv after a process that took almost two years. The service called Kwesé Free TV is yet to launch.Source: NexTVAfrica.com.
