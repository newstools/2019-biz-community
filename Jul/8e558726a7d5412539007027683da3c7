GMP, which is aligned with Google’s strategic focus of integrating products for improved functionality, is a unified advertising and analytics platform that allows the user to deliver smarter, faster marketing. It’s based on the existing and new integrations between the DoubleClick and Google Analytics 360 Suite. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504533-625x334.jpg" alt="Ross Makepeace, Jellyfish Creative Director, delivered a creative perspective about GMP." width="625" height="334">Ross Makepeace, Jellyfish Creative Director, delivered a creative perspective about GMP.More than ever before, data is driving the stories we tell Head of Google Channel Partnerships at Jellyfish SA, Mauritz Gilfillian, explained that the GMP platform can improve enterprise performance through its integrated end-to-end analytics capabilities. “It’s a consolidated approach,” said Gilfillian. “It offers a single tool for planning campaigns, designing and managing creative, organising and applying audience data, finding and buying inventory and measuring and optimising campaigns.” The always-on customer: curious, demanding and impatient Many businesses are not there when their customers need and want them. Today’s consumer expects to receive useful and relevant information in real-time. Based on these findings, Google has developed a comprehensive diagnostic tool that enables businesses to get a true sense of where they are at in terms of their digital maturity. Creating better customer experiences GMP is about creating better experiences. This was the topical theme that Ross Makepeace, Creative Director at Jellyfish SA, unpacked for the audience. “GMP is fit. Can act fast. Adapt quickly. Make faster gains,” said Makepeace, who went on to elaborate, “GMP allows for more control within your team. This means knowing how your budget is spent, where your ads are running - across all campaigns and precise audience targeting for reach and relevance.” Barcelona-based Daniel Smulevich, Head of Analytics at Jellyfish, agreed with this sentiment, “We don’t create ingredients, we create recipes. Cloud for Marketing is a concept designed to help organisations optimise their user journey and build a successful marketing technology.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504535-625x260.jpg" alt="Daniel Smulevich, Head of Analytics for Jellyfish, concentrated on why brands should use Cloud-based marketing to gain a competitive edge." width="625" height="260">Daniel Smulevich, Head of Analytics for Jellyfish, concentrated on why brands should use Cloud-based marketing to gain a competitive edge.Since opening a second office in Rosebank, Johannesburg, Jellyfish has endeavoured to provide the industry with international thought leadership about digital technologies, using some of the country’s best innovators and influencers to showcase proven case studies.
