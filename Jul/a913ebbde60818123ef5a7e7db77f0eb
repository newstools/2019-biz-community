Over five years together, we have created some magical and iconic advertising, which has delivered hard results to the business and also added significantly to our brand equity: from mystics in caravans, to dogs wee-ing on doll houses, to hamster’s “Yoh-hing” their way to Better Futures, to running together in purple Speedo’s, and this year to tangibly living our true purpose in the simplest of ways, by saying ‘he11o’ ”, says CMO, Heidi Brauer.“We part as great friends,” says M&C Saatchi Abel Group MD, Jason Harrison. It’s always sad when a conflict situation occurs, but both Hollard and M&C Saatchi Abel, given our trusted relationship, have approached it in an entirely constructive way. Some quality agency will be very lucky to collaborate on this amazing account, as not only is Hollard a brilliant brand, but they are a wonderful client too. It has been a truly amazing journey filled with humanity and humour. All that is left is to now have a fantastic relationship celebration party,” concludes Harrison.
