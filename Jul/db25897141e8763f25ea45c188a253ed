This year Mail & Guardian received more than 6,000 entries. Schwarp made the list of 200 in the Arts & Entertainment category and Mohapi in the Film & Media category. This accolade comes a few months after Mohapi* won the ‘Best Commercial Weekend Show’ at the Liberty Radio Awards 2019. The international award-winning Public Speaker also heads up Jacaranda FM’s music product. “It truly is an honour to be recognised amongst the best young minds the country has to offer,” Mohapi said about her inclusion into the coveted list. For Schwarp*, making the list came as a welcome surprise that reaffirmed his belief that nothing is impossible if you work hard and remain true to who you are. This kykNET and Kie TV host currently heads up digital for Jacaranda FM and recently produced and directed, SKEEF, a groundbreaking South African LGBTI+ documentary. The Mail & Guardian Top 200 list has become the benchmark to celebrate and recognise excellence across industries and is used to earmark and showcase future young leaders. *Mohapi is currently the host of ‘Weekends with Kenzy Mohapi’ - Saturdays 16h00-19h00 and Sundays 14h00-18h00 on Jacaranda FM. *Schwarp is currently the host of ‘Weekends with Renaldo Schwarp’ - Saturdays 12h00-16h00 and Sundays 10h00-14h00 on Jacaranda FM.
