Digital, which currently makes up about 20% of our business, plays a key role in this strategic growth plan and the company intends to invest substantially in its digital inventory – in the form of small format rotating billboards - in the coming years, so that we can provide advertisers with even more value.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507967.jpg" alt="Outdoor Network achieves milestone with 10th rotating digital billboard added to growing national network" width="470" height="300" rel="">click to enlarge<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507969.jpg" alt="Outdoor Network achieves milestone with 10th rotating digital billboard added to growing national network" width="470" height="300" rel="">click to enlargeDigital OOH represents a significant step forward in the evolution of outdoor advertising and provides advertisers with increased options and in the case of the Outdoor Network’s digital OOH platform, the ability to deliver a national campaign on one network, whilst the rotating billboards offer immense value in terms of coverage, thanks to their ability to tailor and deliver specific messaging for targeted audiences at different times of the day. Further to that, digital OOH integrates more efficiently with social media than any other medium and is able to deliver immense value to advertisers and brands through improved recall, engagement and search, as detailed by the 2017 ‘Advertising Effectiveness – PJSC Study and Recall Comparison Analysis’. This report studied the five primary advertising channels and found that digital OOH – including digital billboards, digital-placed based networks and digital signage – returned an ‘advertising recall’1 of 82% compared with that of printed OOH (67%), TV (62%), desktop online (57%), mobile online (52%), and print (52%).The growth of Outdoor Network’s expanding digital network is significant for brands seeking a cutting-edge platform that delivers regional and national coverage in high reach and frequency locations. Further, as evidenced by international studies – such as that already cited – DOOH has the ability to meet the needs of a dynamic multi-brand strategy, whilst also offering significant levels of recall, engagement and brand awareness.To find out how Outdoor Network’s roadside LED can help your brand deliver flexible, immediate and effective out-of-home campaigns nationally, contact info@on.co.zabRev('brev-8856ea53-5adf-4225-b7b9-2e790d0b0394', '>a/\<az.oc.no@ofni>"az.oc.no;46#&ofni:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').Follow Outdoor Network on Twitter @outdoornetsa, Facebook @OutdoorNetworkSA, on LinkedIn or visit www.on.co.zaAbout Outdoor Network:Outdoor Network, a division of PMG, is one of the largest South African Out-of-Home media owners, offering national reach with a host of billboards and street furniture platforms.
