On the label, this translates into beautiful finishes and a highlight of the 8-year-old pedigree. While on the outer box, premium detailing builds on the brand iconography and displays the journey of creating an Oloroso Finish.Even though it was priced at a premium and made exclusively available online and from the brand home, the Oloroso edition was entirely sold out within weeks of release. Connoisseurs are already poised to get their hands on the next edition, while all eyes are on the brand to see what it launches next.
