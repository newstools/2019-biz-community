Posterscope South Africa, a Cape Town and Johannesburg based OOH Location Specialist Services Media Agency is part of Dentsu Aegis Network. Livia Brown, General Manager of Posterscope Cape Town as well as six other ladies (Simone Visser, Anne Kairuz, Melissa Kleinsmith, Carmen Freemantle, Sharne Daniels and Mando Mokone) were inspired to make a difference and spent their 67 minutes for Mandela Day at the Primary School.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/508570.jpg" alt="Posterscope Cape Town completes 67 mins at Dryden Street Primary" width="600" height="800">The Posterscope team arrived at the school’s premises with 40 litres of chicken and vegetable soup. 5 litres of the soup was generously donated from Pronto Deli as well as 46 loaves of bread and 10 oversized packets of marshmallows.On arrival, the Posterscope Cape Town team received an extremely warm welcome by the Head of School, Mr Joubert. Mr Joubert led the way into their kitchen where the ladies from Posterscope took turns preparing the soup. Within record time, the team managed to plate up the soup and started serving. The children had huge smiles pausing for pictures with their cup of soup in their hands.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/508571.jpg" alt="Posterscope Cape Town completes 67 mins at Dryden Street Primary" width="600" height="800">“We really appreciate what you are doing, look how happy the kids are,” said one of the teachers from Dryden Street Primary. The Posterscope team wrapped up the morning by collecting all the empty cups from the children and ensured that the marshmallows were allocated to the class teachers for distribution. Mr Joubert expressed his words of gratitude to the team and so did the teachers.Livia Brown, General Manager of Posterscope Cape Town said: “I could not think of a better way for us to have spent out 67 minutes on Nelson Mandela day. It was heart warming to see the difference we were making to the kids and staff of Dryden Street Primary School with a small act of kindness and a real reminder that we can all make a difference by giving of ourselves and of our time. ‘What counts in life is not the mere fact that we have lived. It is what difference we have made to the lives of others’, Nelson Mandela.”The above wouldn't have been a success without the collaboration and teamwork from the Posterscope team. Special thanks goes to Dryden Street Primary for welcoming the team into your School.
