Following a very positive response, the magazine will officially be trialled for two months in selected Pick n Pay stores across the country.The June Fresh Living: Braille Issue landed in the selected stores this week and can be picked up at the Customer Care desk.Free to Smart Shopper customers, Fresh Living has grown from 60,000 copies at its launch to over 500,000 copies per month. It provides readers with lifestyle inspiration, the latest food and drink news, and accessible, everyday family recipes with each edition. Sharing Fresh Living with the visually impaired community It is this popularity that led a loyal customer, Jennine Britz, to contact Pick n Pay and offer her Braille translation services in order to share her favourite magazine with the visually impaired community of South Africa. Classified as blind, Jennine has worked closely with Pick n Pay and Fresh Living’s publisher, John Brown, since September last year to develop the sample copy and make the Braille edition of Fresh Living a reality. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504694-625x250.jpg" alt="An SA first: Fresh Living magazine now in Braille" width="625" height="250">The Braille edition was piloted in April through organisations that cater for the blind in KwaZulu-Natal, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, Bloemfontein and Johannesburg. Copies were distributed to visually impaired readers, who shared their feedback and ideas on how to refine it. Embracing our differences “Fresh Living magazine is a wonderfully inclusive publication, and this takes us one excellent step further,” says John Bradshaw, Head of Marketing at Pick n Pay.Jennine says that the foundation of her Braille printing company came from her experience as a blind person living in a sighted-persons’ world. “This is a daily struggle, especially when it comes to using any form of public facility. Pick n Pay is one of a handful of companies that understand my vision of improving public facilities for the blind by having more consideration for their blind consumers. Through the Braille version of Fresh Living, Pick n Pay has brought overwhelming excitement and appreciation to me and hundreds of Braille readers across the country,” she says. Editor of Fresh Living Justine Drake says, “At Fresh Living, we make much of celebrating and embracing our differences, and our decision to print a Braille version of the country’s largest food and lifestyle magazine seemed to present a really tangible way to demonstrate this. I hope it brings much joy and inspiration to our blind and partially sighted communities.” “We listen carefully to our customers and we’re really grateful that Jennine got in touch so that we could expand Fresh Living’s reach to our visually impaired customers. It’s been a rewarding learning process to launch the Braille edition and we are excited to share it in-store with our customers during the next phase of the trial,” says John Bradshaw.
