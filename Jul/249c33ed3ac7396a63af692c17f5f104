Sihle Mavuso, who works for Independent Media’s political bureau, was assaulted and apprehended by Durban Metro Police, while covering a protest at the Durban City Hall with fellow journalist Des Erasmus. Erasmus video recorded the incident. Over the weekend, Piet Rampedi and Mzilikazi wa Africa from Independent Media’s investigative unit, lodged harassment and intimidation charges after being followed by unknown vehicles and individuals. Rampedi took photographs of the cars, which followed them. Independent Media is gravely concerned by the increase in the harassment of journalists in South Africa. For democracy to thrive, journalists must be able to operate without the fear of harassment, intimidation and threats of violence.
