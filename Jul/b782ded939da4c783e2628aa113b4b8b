But what are the secrets of balancing creativity and operations? How do we develop a workplace culture that will enable us to successfully compete with much larger global players? And how do we validate what we are communicating through unique creative experiences, giving people a story to tell, rather than just telling people a story?Africa and the Middle East is a hotbed of diversity. International experience indicates that homogenous teams produce homogenous outcomes, while diverse teams, built on different perspectives and experiences, innovate faster and more meaningfully. Instead of fearing diversity and trying to equalise all our cultures, how do we harness the power of diversity? Creative and innovative brands are not lucky – it takes work and a successful formula. There are practical and structured tools of creativity that can be applied to make businesses more creative, more effective and, perhaps most importantly,  improve the bottomline. These ideas are at the heart of the DStv Seminar of Creativity. Speakers include Nedal Ahmed, Senior Copywriter at 72andSunny, Amsterdam; Ravid Kuperberg, a partner at Mindscapes International; Tara Mckenty, Creative Director at Google APAC, Sydney, Ralf Heuel, CCO and Partner, Grabarz & Partner, Hamburg; Katja Thielen, Co-Founder, Together Design, London and Manuel Bordé, Executive Creative Director, TBWA\RAAD Dubai.Loeries Creative Week takes place from 22 to 25 August in Durban.
