Carbon is one of the most essential elements for human life, it is found in all life forms and is extremely versatile. So to us, Carbon represents our aspiration to go everywhere with our customers, become an essential part of their lives and be versatile enough to change or innovate to fulfill their needs. We know what our customers’ pain points and needs are when it comes to banking in Africa and we are building financial products around them.” The rebrand also sealed a busy few months for Carbon, after they acquired payments company Amplify, cementing their move into multiple strands of financial services; and secured a $5mn investment from fintech platform Lendable.Say hello to the future. Paylater is now Carbon.⁣⁣⁣⁣#PaylaterGoesCarbon pic.twitter.com/87yTdkRCme— Carbon (Paylater) (@get_carbon) April 8, 2019Here, CEO, Chijioke Dozie, explains the backstory to the rebrand and opportunities on the continent:.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why rebrand Paylater to Carbon?Most of our customers knew us as Paylater, which only conjured up images of credit. We offer many more services such as savings, free credit reports and bill payments and the goal is to go beyond this. You can see that our previous name didn’t reflect this, which is why a rebrand was so critical.
