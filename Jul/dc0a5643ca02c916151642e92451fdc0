The exercise opened their minds to the various career opportunities that exist within the advertising discipline. To make the day meaningful for the pupils, they were challenged to interrogate a mock brief for an A1 Youth Month poster. In the same way that it would be done for client, a person from each department within the agency took the learners through the brief and gave an overview of their department, thereby giving the pupils a practical understanding of how the agency works. The students then had an opportunity to sit with the design team and brief in elements of the poster, which was then printed out for them on photographic paper. At the end of the day, the poster was handed over to the pupils as a souvenir of their time at Brave and most importantly, it served as a reminder of the infinite possibilities that await them as young people in this country. “We have been extremely fortunate to have partners like Brave Group who share our vision to give back to our communities through this youth-focused initiative, and who gave our learners an experience second to none,” says Msizi Mazibuko, CEO of the Media Tacticians Foundation. “Both companies share a mutual passion for paying it forward to less-advantaged youth wanting to join the media and marketing industry,” she said.
