This proof of ROI is the justification, as opposed to classic planning metrics of cost per thousand (CPT), reach and frequency,” she added.Nielsen analysts surveyed brands across six categories, which included toothpaste, analgesics, coffee, snacks and chips, chocolate and liquor (spirits, wine and ciders) over 156 weeks. The advanced analytics team conducted regression analysis right down to the individual store level.Briefly, it found:Digital gives the best return on investmentPrint gives the third-best ROIMedia that is read (print and digital combined) gives better ROI than any other above-the-line mediaWhen combinations of all above the line media are used, sales lifts can increase up to 10% on top of what each would contribute individually Mix and match media Peter Langschmidt, a research consultant to the PRC, said there were hundreds of combinations so “media has to be switched on and off continually and sales measured if the regression is going to truly identify the particular advertising medium as the cause of the sales change. This is the primary reason why these case studies are on-going for over three years and are truly robust”.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507952.png" alt="Digital, print media deliver the best ROI - finds new Nielsen study" width="505" height="360">For every rand spent, digital performs best and returns R2.30 while print at R1.35 is in third place. A simple average of these two ‘read’ media is a whopping R1.83, greater than any other single medium.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/504142-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The secret of radio's success: its old strengths remain, but it evolves with the times" width="120" height="120">The secret of radio's success: its old strengths remain, but it evolves with the timesNow that we live in a world of Netflix, Spotify and smartphones, people often ask why radio still has such strong staying power as a mass medium and as a channel for advertising...By wayne bischoff 27 Jun 2019As Langschmidt points out, the case studies developed over three years now provide solid evidence that detailed product information, prices and comparisons on hundreds of brands and store locations translate directly into more sales at the till and a better advertising ROI.Read the full study here
