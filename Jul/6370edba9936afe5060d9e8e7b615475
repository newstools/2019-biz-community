The brands in the ranking reflect "a day in the life" of our consumers, they are all very relevant and relatable, with some great South African humour coming through...Issued by Kantar 10 Jul 2019In the number 1 spot is Nando’s ‘We can fix our S#*t’ advertisement. Jake Johnstone, media and advertising manager for Nando’s says it’s always inspiring when people recognise an insight you believe to be rich. “Winning an award like this reinforces the fact that sometimes it pays to listen to understand what the public sentiment is and then act on that by giving people a platform.” Work the public notices and cares aboutHe adds that winning an award is always great, but when it is one that is recognised by the people it was created for, it is all the more gratifying. “It is special and something we should never forget.” The ad builds on what audiences have grown to expect from the brand. He said:Thanks to the legacy of our adverting the challenge has been teed up for us whenever we create a new ad. We are fortunate that the people who started the Nando’s brand and developed the narrative and tonality did it so well that it has ensured that it can live forever. Our job is to honour that legacy. It’s a huge challenge every time we step up to it but having a great team around us that understand the Nando’s brand means it is kept consistent with what you expect from the brands while also ensuring that there is an edge to it and offers you something you haven’t seen before.Commenting on the campaign, executive creative director at M&C Saatchi Abel, Adam Weber says this kind of recognition is hugely important. “It’s our job to do creative work that the public notices and cares about. In the period leading up to this project, you really couldn’t make up the kind of news South Africa woke up to each day. The ad resonated because we could all relate to this and it was delivered with a dose of Nando’s humour. It was also about more than just pointing out the madness, it was about reminding South Africa that when we put our minds to it, we can always fix our sh*t."Inspiring a new generation of athletesNike’s ‘Just do it: Caster Semenya’ ad came in second. The ad, that was created by Wieden + Kennedy Amsterdam, celebrates the incredible journey, determination and triumphs of Caster Semenya. It seeks to inspire a new generation of athletes. “Nike has a long history of empowerment through sport. We believe in the power of sport to help athletes to break barriers of what they think is possible and for every athlete to follow their dreams and sports journey,” says a Nike spokesperson. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506446-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Screen grab from Nike's 'Never Stop Winning' ad." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Nike just does it again - this time standing strong for equal payNike's recent run of 'Dream Crazy' ads have won more than just global recognition for their strong push towards inclusion and equality - they're also proving that brands really do make more consumer impact when they put consumer's causes first and foremost...By Leigh Andrews 13 hours agoTVC that fits into the world of the consumerIn third place is Bernini’s ‘Press for Sparkle’ ad by Singh & Sons. This is the first ever TVC by the brand. Marketing manager for Bernini, Tanya Kotze says this, plus the fact that the top two brands are such well-known brands makes this an extremely proud moment for them. ‘‘Both first and second place are very consumer-centric brands and to be in their company shows us that we know what drives our consumer,” she says. ‘‘We saw the growth of the brand and knew we needed to engage with consumers. This was about making a TVC that fits into the world of this consumer, the progressive sparkling female.”‘‘The award is authentic because it is consumers that have chosen it. Our consumer is opinionated so if they did not like the ad we would have known,” she adds. They also shot everything on set, with no use of any green screen or technology, to make it authentic. “This made the ad believable,” says Cheryl Winkelman, account director, Singh & Sons. She explains that this consumer is female, young and starting out on their careers. ‘‘They want sparkle in their lives that makes them feel special.”‘‘The award is authentic because it is consumers that have chosen it. Our consumer is opinionated so if they did not like the ad we would have known.
