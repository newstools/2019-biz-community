Included in the parcel were fruit, sandwiches, cold drinks, blankets, soap, socks, donated clothes, deodorant, toothbrush and toothpaste. “The hampers were so gratefully received,” said Expand a Sign’s marketing manager Kirsty Fonzari. “Such a small gesture and yet it made such a big difference in those people’s day.”Nelson Mandela said that "A society that does not value its older people denies its roots and endangers its future. Let us strive to enhance their capacity to support themselves for as long as possible and, when they cannot do so anymore, to care for them." Taking this to heart, down in Cape Town, an Expand a Sign team delivered food parcels and Uzwelo gift bags to a healing home for the elderly in Blackheath. They also baked a cake and scones, and spent time chatting to the residents, many of whom have long been forgotten by family. “The gratitude and smiles from everyone including the staff was a moment I won’t forget in a long time,” said Fonzari. “I feel so humbled to have been a part of this campaign.”One of Mandela’s greatest legacies was his contribution to education. “It is not beyond our power to create a world in which all children have access to a good education. Those who do not believe this have small imaginations,” he said. Madiba recognised education as a great vehicle to bring equality of opportunity to the world, and so in KwaZulu-Natal, the like-minded Expand a Sign and Uzwelo teamed up with Westridge High and donated 1,000 pencil cases to the school. The pencil cases were made from excess Expand a Sign banner material. Westridge High is a pre-vocational school for over 800 children with learning disabilities. “We believe it’s import to keep investing and uplifting our local community,” said Fonzari. The donation was split over two days, with Expand a Sign teams having the opportunity to address the pupils at assembly on both days. It was a meaningful time for both the scholars and the teams. “Giving back to people is very close to our hearts,” said Fonzari. “At Expand a Sign, we believe every one of us has a valuable contribution to make, which inspires us to give more of ourselves. It’s about achieving as a team and striving to put passion into process, with a can-do attitude. Helping our communities, particularly for something as important as Mandela Day, is our way of giving more of ourselves – and improving other people’s lives just a little bit.”For more information on other community projects that Expand a Sign and Uzwelo Bags are involved in, visit www.expandasign.co.za and www.uzwelo.co.za
