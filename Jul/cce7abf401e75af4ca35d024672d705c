As digital marketing is a highly sought-after skill – the world over – this will mean that people taking these courses will become more employable.The rising demand for digital marketersGlobal recruitment companies are reporting an upsurge in the demand for digital marketers. Specific skills that are highly sought after include: Lead Generation  Inbound Marketing SEO PPC and Google AdWords“This spike in demand for digital marketers has been prompted by the change in customer buying habits,” says Lisa Schneider: managing director of the Digital School of Marketing. “Organisations are preferring to conduct business online as this broadens their target market. No longer are businesses limited to selling to people who can come to their bricks-and-mortar establishment. They are now able to sell to people who live in very different geographical locations.”Technology and the economyIn his February State of the Nation Address, President Cyril Ramaphosa emphasised the role that technology and the Fourth Industrial Revolution have to play in uplifting our economy. To keep in line with this vision, the Department of Communications, together with Broadband Infraco, has overseen 508 rural sites being connected to the Internet grid.This makes online education – in particular online digital marketing education – a reality that can be achieved for people in these communities. “The most tangible benefit of online education is that it is much more affordable for the student. This is because there are no costs, which are usually involved with face-to-face classes, such as venue hire, electricity, etc.,” concludes Schneider. “However, because these courses are SETA accredited and backed by reputable institutions – as ours are – the online courses have the same weight as those done in bricks and mortar institutions.” The Digital School of Marketing is an online provider of accredited digital marketing education which is accredited by the MICT Seta.
