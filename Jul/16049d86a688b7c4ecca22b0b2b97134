“Having to select just one emerging designer in a city so full of design talent is a daunting task, but Kadi Matsaung is truly a designer to watch out for,” said Sian Cullingworth, portfolio director at Reed Exhibitions. Her unique style which leans towards the overriding minimalism trend has a real African essence that works into this year’s theme, ‘Designing for Africa - feels like home’. Her installation concept is incredible – visitors are going to be truly inspired.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/508866.jpg" alt="Image supplied." width="625" height="351">Image supplied.Despite initially pursuing a career in media where she worked as an implementation planner, Matsaung has always had a deep-rooted love for interior design. Kadi recalls her parents re-decorating their home during her childhood years as the first indicator of her talents.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/489584.jpg" alt="Decorex Durban welcomes big crowds to African-inspired exhibition" width="120" height="120">Decorex Durban welcomes big crowds to African-inspired exhibitionIt was non-stop inspiration at this year's Decorex Durban...Issued by Reed Exhibitions 29 Mar 2019“My parents decided to paint our entire home interior in sweet pink, but nothing made sense! The colour had no rhythm within the house and the paint didn't play any role in harmonising the area,” explained Matsaung. “It was too strong of a colour for the existing furniture and décor, overpowering the beauty of the décor. All I could see were these sweet pink walls when it was the furniture pieces in the room that should've been the winner.”The visual impact prompted Matsaung to arrange her own room with her own style: “Anytime I got money, I would always ask – how can I make my personal living space more beautiful? I was never one to follow trends but rather opted for simple chic.”While working in the media environment, Matsaung would grab every opportunity to work on interior décor and design projects after hours. This eventually led to her taking the leap in 2018 when she established Interior Spacez. Her primary focus is on residential décor, incorporating her signature simple elegance into every design.We caught up with Matsaung, who shared more about her role and what it entails and what she is most excited about regarding the event..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} Congrats on being selected as 2019 Decorex Joburg's Emerging Designer.

Highly blessed. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} What does the role entail?As a decorator, my job is working with soft furnishings – such as furniture, rugs, fabrics and colours. The process begins with a consultation, the scope of the project is then discussed. This includes the budget and style preference. Once agreed we move on to a mood board. Once everyone is happy with everything (measurements taken and all), the shopping begins. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/482821-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Interior design of the future will seem like magic" width="120" height="120">Interior design of the future will seem like magicImagine a house where the walls change colour depending on your mood, or your tablecloth changes shape when you're having a dinner party...By Sara Nabil 18 Feb 2019<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/508858.jpg" alt="Young designer Kadi Matsaung has been chosen as this year's Decorex Joburg's Emerging Designer." width="360" height="545">Young designer Kadi Matsaung has been chosen as this year's Decorex Joburg's Emerging Designer..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} What excites you most about the industry and where it’s going?This industry gives you a platform to be creatively in charge.
