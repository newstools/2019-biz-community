Not only do we honour the South African creative agency teams for their innovative use of social and digital media, and cutting-edge use of online media and tools, we also acknowledge corporate companies and their in-house marketing teams from across our region for their work on campaigns that help promote their organisations and brands in ground-breaking ways.Corporate companies and brands who do not use a media agency and who wish to enter these awards can do so directly. There's 43 categories to choose from!!<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504933.jpg" alt="Deadline for entries looms near for 2019 New Generation Social &amp; Digital Media Awards" width="625" height="163">The New Generation Awards offers an array of exciting categories best suited in recognising today’s leading marketers. Now in our seventh successive year, we will continue to recognise new generations of award-winning talent for years to come.The awards celebrate ingenuity, with a specific focus on results and insight-based success, which makes the awards unique “The awards continually evolve to include new trends in social and digital media, new industry technology and platforms, as well as international trends making their way into South Africa,” says Stephen Paxton, managing director of the New Generation Social & Digital Media Awards.– A fairer adjudication process sees each entry marked by at least four judges, measuring them against criteria such as innovation, creativity, strategy, content, results, reach and sales. Judges do not adjudicate any categories into which their agencies have entered.“Although there will always be an element of emotion involved, the judging criteria ensures that it is primarily about the results. A meaningful digital marketing experience is a smart idea executed brilliantly, with the facts to back it up – that’s how the judges will be scrutinising each campaign,” says Paxton, who maintains the judges still value ingenuity and creative brilliance as key factors in the judging process.For more information on the awards, visit www.newgenawards.co.za.
