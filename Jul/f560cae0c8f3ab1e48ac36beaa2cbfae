Importantly, winners are based on effectiveness and entries must prove to have contributed to the business’ bottom line. The Toyota Rush Launch Campaign did just that, demonstrating how an insight around what FCB dubbed “Aspiration Fatigue” in South African advertising, led to a tongue-and-cheek campaign that replaced the flash and bling usually flaunted by hip-hop superstars, with travel experiences enabled by the Toyota Rush. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/505225-625x330.jpg" alt="Toyota Rush launch wins Marketing Achievement Award" width="625" height="330">The result was a fresh campaign that achieved exceptionally high levels of unprompted praise on social media; scored highly in Kantar’s Adtrack; and dramatically shifted positive online sentiment. Most importantly, the campaign far exceeded Toyota sales projections, enabling the Toyota Rush to claim second spot on the market share podium among its competitors in just six short months. And, it did all this in 2018 – a tough year to launch a new SUV into what was a struggling car market. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/505226-625x339.jpg" alt="Toyota Rush launch wins Marketing Achievement Award" width="625" height="339">Being awarded by the MAA judges is testament to the type of work Toyota and FCB aim to consistently create. And both client and agency are incredibly proud to have been recognised for work that South Africans loved, and that drove sales. The awards saw a total of 480 entries, of which 41 finalists were announced, and finally, 11 winners awarded.
