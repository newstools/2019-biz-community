I want to say well done to all - It’s our team that makes this a great agency,” says Reddy. Grid Worldwide exists as a culture, which is one of its original traditions that has been maintained and implemented at all times, thanks to the efforts of the team. “To our partners, our agency staff, families, expert partners and fans, we thank you for your support and belief in doing courageously brave work,” says partner and co-CEO Adam Byars. David Cohen, founder, partner and co-CEO, explains that the industry can be challenging but, even in such a short time, Grid Worldwide has grown exponentially and spent a lot of time working on global campaigns across Africa and the world, such as the recent ‘Qatar, Qurated for You’ campaign. Grid is excited to celebrate this milestone and looks forward to the next chapter of Making it Mean Something!
