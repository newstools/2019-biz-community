According to the awards team, each nominee is carefully scrutinised and judged on their performance over the past year, their willingness to innovate and even their competition to ensure that only the most deserving are considered. Edward Faulkner, the awards coordinator, explained, “The annual MEA Awards were launched to bring some much-needed recognition and exposure to companies in this vibrant and far-reaching business arena who, through their unwillingness to settle for anything less than the absolute best for themselves and their clients are shaping their industries and corporate community.” Commenting on the success of these deserving winners, Faulkner added, “Congratulations to all of the winners. You are truly the best that the African corporate market has to offer. I am very proud of all of you and I wish you the very best of luck for the future.” To find out more about these prestigious awards and to view the winners supplement and full winners list, visit: https://www.mea-markets.com/.
