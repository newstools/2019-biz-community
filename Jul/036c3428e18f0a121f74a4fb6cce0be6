German-Ugandan actress Florence Kasumba, who plays the hyena Shenzi in the film, helped curate the latest installment, titled 'Style Kingdom', which encompasses a collection of Africa-inspired and -sourced fashion and home goods."[It's] an absolute thrill because I've been able to combine my love of fashion and film whilst connecting back to my African heritage," said Kasumba in a statement. "I love how The Lion King can be interpreted through this new lens and connect with audiences in a unique and fresh way. I felt such a personal connection to the pieces I curated and I can't wait for people to see the collections, and the movie."<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506734-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Florence Kasumba rocks David Tlale outfit at The Lion King premiere" width="120" height="120">Florence Kasumba rocks David Tlale outfit at The Lion King premiereUgandan-born German actress Florence Kasumba sported a David Tlale ensemble at the London premiere of Disney's live-action The Lion King...16 Jul 2019The Style Kingdom concept celebrates the cultural significance of African design.
