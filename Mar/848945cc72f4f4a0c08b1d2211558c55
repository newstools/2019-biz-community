“Gordon has played a huge role over the past nine years, growing the business and, in the process, producing iconic, award-winning work across a broad spectrum of our clients. But starting an agency and achieving all this within nine years is creatively taxing, so mid-last year he indicated a desire to hand over his ECD responsibilities to a suitable successor and focus more on working with the creative teams on key client portfolios as Creative Partner.  Making brilliant work is what fires Gordon up the most, so it’s great that he can just focus on that now. “Jake acquired a wealth of experience in senior creative positions, including that of Executive Creative Director, in a number of leading SA agencies before joining the M&C Saatchi Abel Group over two years ago. Since joining the Group, he has enjoyed a close partnership with Gordon as Creative Partner on a number of key brands. “This is a win-win for our clients and the agency as we now have two massive creative talents in the Cape Town agency. I’m looking forward to working closely with Jake, Gordon and Adam - the Johannesburg ECD - as well as with the massive talent in our creative departments across the Group to ensure we continue to deliver on our purpose of creating beautifully simple solutions for an increasingly complex world,” concluded Neo.
