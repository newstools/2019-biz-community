The agency responded with ‘ku-Rough’, a campaign acknowledging that, while every KOO mom (or dad) wants to do the best for her family every second of every day, she can’t control the ‘ku-Rough’ that might happen when they’re out from under her wings. However, after a long challenging day, the one thing we can always count on is the love we receive at home from mom, our family and a deliciously tasty meal from KOO.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/489355-625x122.jpg" alt="KOO helps mom come put silver lining around her family's 'ku-rough' day" width="625" height="122">“ku-Rough is a slang word derived from the Zulu ‘ku’ and English ‘rough’. It’s used to convey an emotion and a situation,” explained Cameron. “It’s the way you feel when unexpected things happen to inconvenience you; it’s how you describe a day in which things happen to cause you loss of joy. The TVC shows family members having moments of ‘ku-Rough’ – there’s an incident with dad and the taxi door and the daughter with her shattered mobile phone screen. The anecdote for ‘ku-Rough’ is a meal cooked with love and KOO,” he said. “I go all out for my family, I never compromise, cause out there ku-rough," mom says before confidently walking into the dining room with the meal she has lovingly and confidently prepared. It’s obvious how much the family relies and appreciates her, and how much she relies and trusts KOO to help her lift their ‘ku-Rough’ spirits.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/489356-625x122.jpg" alt="KOO helps mom come put silver lining around her family's 'ku-rough' day" width="625" height="122">The 20-second TVC driving the campaign2 was shot by Star Films over two days in Newtown and Bryanston.
