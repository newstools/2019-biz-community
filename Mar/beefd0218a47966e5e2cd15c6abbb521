As usual, listeners can look forward to 24 hours of positivity, fun, chances to win and all round happiness. This year’s theme will be “Happier Together”, focusing on what we have in common, rather than what divides us.All the music played on the day will be of a happy nature, with news, sport and traffic also given a positive spin. A new feature this year will be the positivity pods. These snippets of inspiration from lifestyle coaches and international speakers, including Tony Robbins, Stacey Flowers, Kristina Lakhiani and Jacqueline Way among others, will put our listeners in the right frame of mind.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/487650.jpg" alt="OFM all set to spread happiness on Happiness Day" width="625" height="625" rel="">click to enlargeListeners can tune in throughout the morning to find out how they can score their office a cake bust and let us know what thye think ‘the secret to a long and happy life’ is to enter the draw for a two-night stay at Emperors Palace in the Metcourt Hotel.

In a world saturated by negativity and tragedy, and plagued by the ills of society, it is a welcome relief to celebrate goodness, happiness and fun. We hope to put a smile on as many faces as possible that day!”This year, OFM is supporting the Smile Foundation and we need help. This non-governmental organisation, with a comprehensive health care vision for children living with facial conditions, have been supporting the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at Universitas Academic in Bloemfontein for 10 years now. There is a need for the following items for the children in the ward: new crayons, colouring in books, puzzles, building blocks, kiddies’ blankets and beanies. (Please consider donating new items as there is the risk of infection with second-hand ones.) These items can be dropped off at Central Media Park at 7 Christo Groenewald Street, Wild Olive Estate, Bloemfontein before 12:00 noon on 20 March 2019.The United Nations has celebrated International Day of Happiness since 2013 as a way to recognise the importance of happiness in the lives of people around the world. In 2015, the UN launched the 17 Sustainable Development Goals that seek to end poverty, reduce inequality and protect our planet – three key aspects that lead to wellbeing and happiness.
