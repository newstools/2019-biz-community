This signals to me that the international creative community recognises Africa, and South Africa in particular, in terms of our unique brand of creativity and innovation. It shows interest in our point of view and welcomes us to be part of the voices that celebrate ideas that are truly universal, as well as ideas that connect across cultures in a fresh and new way..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to, from the judging experience? Meeting the other judges, seeing the work, the ideas, the craft in particular, and learning from emerging global trends.International work is always interesting as it comes from a first-world perspective, but there is also work that is universal and deals with subjects we all face as a society – challenges that our local brands also face as our world evolves..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Definitely. Based on that point, how does judging international award shows affect the work you do yourself? It definitely elevates it, makes it more global and validates the fact that we need to continue developing our own breed of creative that is distinct work that represents us – our people, our culture and aesthetic. This is evident in the work that is already making its way onto the global stage through the likes of Nelson Makamo, Trevor Stuurman, Black Coffee, Karabo Poppy Moletsane, Porky Hefer and Laduma Ngxokolo, just to name a few.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1711/418248-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Trevor Stuurman was a speaker at WGSN's Futures Cape Town." width="120" height="120">#EntrepreneurMonth: Talking African inspiration with Trevor StuurmanOne of the highlights of WGSN's Futures Cape Town was an inspirational talk by 24-year-old Trevor Stuurman - in effortless digitally savvy youth fashion, this Christmas Day baby is an entrepreneur, photographer and multimedia visual artist with a verified Instagram account and over 156,000 Twitter followers -  here's why his fresh ideas resonate so deeply....By Leigh Andrews 10 Nov 2017<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/443356-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Porky Hefer presents endangered species project at Design Miami/Basil" width="120" height="120">Porky Hefer presents endangered species project at Design Miami/BasilFrom 12 to 17 June 2018,  SFA Advisory and Southern Guild will present a unique project by renowned South African artist Porky Hefer at Design Miami/Basel.4 Jun 2018<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1804/438490-120x120.jpg?2" alt="MaXhosa by Laduma takes Zara to task for alleged design knock-off" width="120" height="120">MaXhosa by Laduma takes Zara to task for alleged design knock-offCelebrated South African fashion designer Laduma Ngxokolo, creator of the MaXhosa by Laduma brand, is taking legal action against Spanish fashion retailer Zara over an alleged case of copyright infringement...25 Apr 2018Seems award season 2019 and beyond will be full of SA-flavoured inspiration.
