How we create opportunities in the face of so many challenges really resonates with international viewers.”The rise of distribution channels like Netflix and Amazon Prime means that a South African startup can tell these stories at scale, which is exactly what the Matt Brown Show is doing.“The why of the Matt Brown Show has always been to help as many entrepreneurs and business leaders as possible through the sharing of information, insights and experiences at scale,” says Brown. “With distribution now on Amazon Prime means that our show is now being distributed globally by Amazon Prime USA and UK, and we’re able to secure an on-demand subscription audience as well as direct-to-home viewers in key major markets in the US and EMEA.”Engaging premium audiencesThe Matt Brown Show was launched as an audio podcast only.
