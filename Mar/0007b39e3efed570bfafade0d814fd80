Analysing the two periods, Ornico finds that South Africa’s top financial services institutions had less new adverts flighting for the first time across all mediums. Among the top six banks whose advertising spend was analysed, only Absa remained consistent in the number of new advertisements that the brand released. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/486971-625x406.jpg" alt="Number of new ads by banks from November 2017 to January 2018 and November 2018 to January 2019" width="625" height="406">Number of new ads by banks from November 2017 to January 2018 and November 2018 to January 2019The two periods show a decline of 38% in terms of new advertisements – flighting for the first time – that were released by the biggest brands in the sector. Standard Bank, Nedbank and African Bank show the most decline which points to cautious spending over the two periods. Further study reveals that the decrease in spend did not change the top categories with savings & investments, sport, brand adverts and personal loans taking centre-stage across all banking brands.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/486972-625x406.jpg" alt="Total number of new ads by banks across mediums" width="625" height="406">Total number of new ads by banks across mediumsTymeBank, Discovery Bank and Bank Zero will be ramping their services this year while their larger competitors seem to be slowing down their communication.

This was achieved with little to no advertising in comparison to how the industry operates and it shows the increasing use of digital in banking.This begs the question, are big banks waiting to see what these entrants have up their sleeve before increasing their advertising initiatives?
