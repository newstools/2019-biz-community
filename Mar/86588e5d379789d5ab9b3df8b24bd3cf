If you are a small business owner in South Africa, please click here to take the survey, it will only take 5 -10 minutes of your time to complete.   Small businesses are an important part of South Africaâ€™s economy, but many struggle to access the finance and markets they need to thrive. The IFC wants to better understand what it will take to strengthen South African micro, small and medium enterprises and help them become bigger engines of job creation and growth. The small business voice is crucial. In March, the IFC formally released The Unseen Sector: A Report on the MSME Opportunity in South Africa, an in-depth look at the market profile, size, and key barriers to growth. The IFC is now engaging directly with small businesses to generate innovative solutions to support small businesses. The survey is part of this initiative.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/487865.jpg" alt="The IFC wants to hear from small businesses in South Africa - take the survey!" width="300" height="250">
