Amfi Craft hasn't invested in marketing until now and previously relied on word-of-mouth marketing and referrals. “We’re only one of seven organisations worldwide who ‘do what we do’,” remarks Amfi Craft director, Vaughn Finkelstein. “In our 20-plus years we have used informal marketing to grow, but now is the time to invest in our brand and establish our global footprint even further. "The Boomtown creative track record and expansive geographic reach will be key to our success as we create a globally relevant brand." Andrew MacKenzie, Boomtown managing director, added: "Amfi Craft is a proudly Eastern Cape business that’s competing in a global market. It’s an honour, and tremendous privilege, to partner with a team that has the vision and ambition to enter and compete in exciting markets and understand the power of a brand to do just that.”
