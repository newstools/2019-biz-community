She will host a new mid-morning programme called “Upfront with Refilwe Moloto”. Listeners will know Moloto as a weekly finance and business contributor to the popular Afternoon Drive with John Maytham show in addition to her various stand-ins on other programmes including Breakfast and The Money Show. Upfront with Refilwe starts on Monday, 11 March 2019, and will serve the CapeTalk audience in Cape Town; it will replace The Eusebius McKaisier show which has been simulcast with sister station 702. The Eusebius McKaiser show will continue broadcasting to its 702 audience in Johannesburg and beyond. “Research and a perpetual review of our offering have fuelled the decision to prioritise Cape Town-related news and issues during the mid-mornings. 'Upfront with Refilwe' will provide Capetonians with a healthy mix of current affairs, lifestyle, fashion and business. International news and trends will feature too,” explains CapeTalk programme manager, Tessa van Staden. Van Staden added: “Refilwe is well known to the CapeTalk audience. Her passion for the city and her broad interests will be reflected. The show will also hold true to the station’s commitment to making information accessible. Refilwe won’t shy away from talking tough. I want to thank Eusebius McKaiser for his dedication and commitment to having brave conversations that have challenged our audience.” “I am honoured to join the CapeTalk family in a permanent capacity. The station offers a world-class approach to broadcasting and when the opportunity came, to be involved on a more consistent basis, I could not resist. I look forward to creating meaningful conversations and forging a special relationship with our audience,” said Refilwe Moloto. In addition to discussing the news and information of the day. “Upfront with Refilwe” will engage high-profile personalities about the lesser-known aspects of their lives, habits and major influences during the third hour (11am) of the show called “Up Close & Personal”. Listeners can look forward to in depth discussions with – among others – rapper and actress Boity as well as National Geographic explorer-in-residence Professor Lee Berger in the first week. The station has also announced the expansion of the role of popular late-night host, Sara-Jayne King. This author and former journalist will be moving to weekends.
