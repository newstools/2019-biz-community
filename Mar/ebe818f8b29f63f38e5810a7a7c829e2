I believe that the past few years in advertising agency executive management have prepared me for this very important role.  I am eternally grateful for an experience filled with great success at M&C Saatchi Abel, an agency that is led by some of the best talent in our country, who work on some of the most sought-after client brands.” At the M&C Saatchi Group, he leaves behind a powerful and cohesive Johannesburg leadership team of immense depth and breadth, ably spearheaded by the Group’s Chief Creative Officer, Neo Mashigo, and supported by senior partners like Makosha Maja-Rasethaba, Head of Strategy, and Adam Weber, Executive Creative Director. The Group’s national Partner Model also means that co-founders and senior executives work weekly across the Cape Town and Johannesburg agencies to ensure sustained growth and the continual creation of compelling advertising and marketing solutions underpinned by the agency’s founding principle of Brutal Simplicity of Thought. Mike Abel, Co-Founder and Chief Executive of the M&C Saatchi Group (Africa), said: “Jerry has made an enormous contribution to growing our Group in Johannesburg over the past five years. He has seen in the arrival of many wonderful partner businesses, amazing clients and has attracted lots of incredible talent.
