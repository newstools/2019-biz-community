She started off her media career at TLC Media selling washroom advertising. “If you can sell that you can sell anything,” Cara says laughing. After that she worked at Relativ Media where she got her first taste of real OOH.  Most recently, Cara worked at The Media Factory learning all the ins and outs of Retail Media. There, she was responsible for generating leads and meeting sales goals. This background has helped Cara to make an easy transition into her current position with Tractor Outdoor. Before starting her career in media, Cara studied Events Management and enjoyed it so much that she ended up working in the industry for two years. “That was really the best starting point for me. “I feel like if you can make a client happy at an event even though you have had to put out a million fires in the last half an hour, then you will be ready for any working career.” says Cara.Contact Tractor Outdoor for all your outdoor advertising needs:www.tractoroutdoor.com0869990226info@tractoroutdoor.combRev('brev-089abb80-c342-420d-90e3-b6129b8a2d0d', '>a/\<moc.roodtuorotcart@ofni>"moc.roodtuorotcart;46#&ofni:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<')
