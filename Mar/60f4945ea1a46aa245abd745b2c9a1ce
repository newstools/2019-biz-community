So why haven't you got a great email signature?" width="625" height="108">Don’t let your email signature be the weak link in your business. You and your employees deserve better. Need convincing? Here’s five good reasons why... You’re a professional (so why don’t your email signatures look professional?)You didn’t choose your company logo from clip-art, so why settle for a one-size-fits all email signature template? There are many ways an email signature can make you look amateurish: off-brand fonts, empty fields and cluttered layouts (do you really need to mention every award?). It might be a cliché, but first impressions really do count and for your email signatures to make an immediate professional impact you need a professional design. Rocketseed’s expert email signature designers work with your brand guidelines to create a bespoke professional email signature template for your business that displays perfectly on every device.You’ve got a great brand (so why aren’t your email signatures consistently branded?)Your brand is far more than just your logo, it’s consistent set of values you deliver at every customer touch-point. Even once you’ve got a professional email signature design in place, it’s vital that it’s rolled out consistently on every employee email across your business. And the only way to achieve this is by having centralised control. We give you centralised control so you can update all your employee signatures (whether that’s 10 or 10,000) company-wide at the click of a button. What’s more, Rocketseed signatures are totally tamper-proof so it’s impossible for any employee to get ‘creative’ with their own signature independently.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/487073.jpg" alt="You've got a great business. So why haven't you got a great email signature?" width="625" height="271">You want real marketing results (so why are you missing out on a ‘hero’ marketing channel?) An interactive email signature creates so many engagement opportunities. Consider the numbers for a second. The average employee sends 1,000 emails a month, with an open rate of 99%. That’s a lot of opportunities for their email signatures to drive visitors to your website, document downloads and social channels for very little investment. Add a compellingly clickable call-to action and suddenly you’ve got a new marketing channel to promote everything from exclusive offers to ebooks and events. And with Rocketseed every recipient click is tracked and reported.  Want to see a snapshot of your email signature marketing success?
