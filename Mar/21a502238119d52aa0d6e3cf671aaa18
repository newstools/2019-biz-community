Just do itShe advises brands to take a cue from British-American author Simon Sinek, who in a 2009 Ted Talk, said: "People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it." Abrahams uses the Pepsi-Kendall Jenner debacle in comparison to Nike’s effective use of Colin Kaepernick, and its subsequent sales spike and social media growth, as an example of how to get it right. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/458308-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: How Nike inspires others to 'just do it' with commodity activism" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: How Nike inspires others to 'just do it' with commodity activismWhat do Colin Kaepernick, Serena Williams and Caster Semenya have in common?

What you do merely serves as proof of what you believe.”  But she warns that it has to be sincere: “Trust me, we can tell when it’s forced.”
