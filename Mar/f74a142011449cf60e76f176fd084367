Fast-forward two decades and that's exactly what happened. Through an online poll, Botha asked conference attendees a number of questions, with the results updated in real-time, on what they purchase most often and their biggest 'online experience' challenges  tops were payments and delivery times, which often lead to huge amounts of frustration - unfortunate for a process typically built to delight.That makes sense when contrasted against typical traditional retail as digital journeys are messy, which means they’re emotional. Research shows that people buy online while they're at work, while they're driving and when they're on the toilet - probably not how you picture them at that stage of the customer journey.Botha took attendees on a similar emotional rollercoaster because while so much has been spoken about customer experience and its importance in building a customer-centric business in the modern customer space, with so many hard elements pulling for resources, it's critical to place what seems like a soft discipline at the core of your business.Fine-tune your customer gaze on Generation CXSimply put, if your customer gaze is purely from a product perspective, you're missing crucial opportunities to interact with your consumers when they experience the highs and lows of emotion along the way. That's why Botha says to design customer journeys based first on customer needs, then to focus on their specific story, goals and feelings - only then can you use those learnings to differentiate with meaning.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1703/385401-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Artisticco LLC © –" width="120" height="120">2017: The year of taking your business from Gen X to Gen CXOn the day of love, Tuesday, 14 February, BrandLove fittingly held the much-loved Cape Town version of its CX trends update for 2017 at 360 Business Parks in Paarden Eiland...By Leigh Andrews 27 Mar 2017Sadly, many businesses just aren't tapping into 'Generation CX'. If you do nothing else, watch the 'Meet Generation CX' video as it explains how the balance of power is changing and that focusing on consumers purely by their generational handle isn't winning you brand loyalty:It's incorporating that outlook into your brand essence that'll help define your customer experiences.The business of experiences and unboxing emotionWhile offering an experience through the traditional bricks-and-mortar retail journey is relatively easy to explain, it's a more internal process for the online experience as those tend to be driven by emotion. When all goes well the customer saves time in simply logging in wherever they are rather than driving to the store, has an easy return and comparison process, and there's a level of privacy as you can choose to make your purchases anonymously and steer clear from crowds. Emotion drives most of this process.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475177-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Chantel Botha, head of customer experience strategy and consulting at BrandLove." width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: The brand promise chasm is widening for consumersAt the end of every year I take out my crystal ball, dust it off and think about the future...By Chantel Botha 23 Jan 2019The downside is what Botha touched on in her earlier audience poll - the absence of sensory experience and human contact, the heavy shipping costs, unforeseen delays if the product is out of stock, often excessive packaging, as well as the risk of fraud and uncertainty of what you're really getting if it's a new product or service.That uncertainty of 'what did you actually get' ties in with the popularity of 'unboxing' videos online, with Botha using the following example to tie together the threads of her presentation:Design for those moments of delight and disappointmentUnfortunately, it takes a lot more to impress customers and less to disappoint them today, as expectations and needs have changed drastically over the past few years, with few brands making the effort to keep up with the trend. Customers will shift loyalty fast if your brand disappoints.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/488195-625x325.jpg?2" alt="Chantel Botha of BrandLove in action at eCommerce Africa 2019." width="625" height="325">Chantel Botha of BrandLove in action at eCommerce Africa 2019.Remember that in customer journeys, it's important to also map the moments you have no control over as a brand, like the customer experience in the parking lot of the mall where your store is based.
