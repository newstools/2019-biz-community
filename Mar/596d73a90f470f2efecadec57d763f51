Strategy is your directionDon’t go into customer experience with a plan of action. Develop a proper strategy that can be referred to by all teams involved. By creating a customer experience strategy that involves the entire organisation, its easier for individuals and teams to buy into the new way of thinking and operating. It also underlines everyone’s roles and responsibilities in bringing proper CX implementation to life.Develop your brand promiseA brand promise is exactly what it sounds like: it’s the essence of what your customers can expect from you. By having a clear brand promise you can always align your work with the promise to ensure you are delivering exactly to your customers’ expectations. The brand promise should be detailed enough so that it’s not misleading, and it should guide all stakeholders in their efforts.Engage your teamsOnce your team know the brand promise inside out and has studied the strategy and understands their role in how it unfolds; it’s time to ensure that they are fully engaged in what they have to do to deliver on the promise and the strategy. No matter their role, from product packer to manager, each position in the business is an integral part of the customer experience and the people responsible need to own this. Treating employees fairly, being open, honest and transparent, and also ensuring they are properly taken care of financially, will go a long way to ensuring they work hard for the brand and its customers.Give profitable customers some extra loveAll businesses will have brand advocates, who support the brand wholeheartedly and always speak keenly of them. These people also spend a lot of money with the business and are a major contributing factor to the overall success. These customers deserve a little additional love and attention over and above the everyday customer – who is also incredibly important and special! Focusing on loyalty drivers is a great way to ensure your most loyal customers stay that way. Some examples of how you can offer extra love to these customers include:  Personalised vouchers based on shopping preferences.  Personalised notifications giving customers a heads up about a sale on an item they purchase frequently.  Queuing up a customer’s most-loved products on the home page of an online shop. Seamless access Seamless is a word used so often to describe user experience, because it defines a smooth, easy and intuitive experience from start to finish. There are no gaps or boundaries in the way, which results in a customer feeling satisfied and rewarded. Customers want easy access to everything they need, which includes having a helpful person at the end of the phone, being able to engage in LiveChat and having their questions answered, being able to move through a transaction without having to wonder about any of the steps that need to be taken. They want to know their every whim is catered to in a trouble-free manner.Use data to build loyaltyData can tell you so much about your customers if you use it in the right way. It can give you all the insight you need to create tailored loyalty offerings that suit the individual, rather than try and cater to a broad mass of people with different interests.
