The Hot 91.9FM Radio Training Academy has been in existence for four years and is a free course, as prescribed by Hot 91.9FM’s license agreement. It is a sustainable mentorship course feeding young talent to the broadcasting industry and is yet another example of Hot 91.9FM`s commitment to radio development and the broader community.
