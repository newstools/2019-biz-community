<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/489741.jpg" alt="Linda Sokhulu to take Rhythm City to another level!" width="560" height="373">She joins the cast as Ziyanda, a smart, savvy businessperson who has a booming laugh and a dirty sense of humour. She takes no nonsense, but doesn’t have to prove she’s tough. She is both streetwise and worldly, and knows how to use her beauty and brains to get what she wants. To top it all, men want to be with her and women want to be like her.  She comes into Suffo’s life and lures him into a bigger world of business and power. She becomes his unlikely buddy. Ziyanda’s a tough-talking broad who isn’t afraid to speak her mind. She isn’t intimidated by Suffo in the slightest and speaks to him in a way he wouldn’t accept from another woman.  “I am looking forward to playing Ziyanda – it’s a very challenging role. She is worldly and street smart, sexy and driver. She knows exactly what she wants and is not afraid to speak her mind. David and Suffo have no idea what they’re in for!” says Linda. Ziyanda unwittingly challenges Suffo and Puleng’s compatibility, and ultimately highlights their very different goals. Will Puleng perceive her as a rival? Ziyanda is the epitome of elegant sexiness.
