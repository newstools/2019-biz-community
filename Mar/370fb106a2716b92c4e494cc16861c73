The agency’s young team was eager to win the Salsa Mexican Grill account. “Salsa Mexican Grill is already renowned not only for its deliciously authentic Mexican cuisine and ‘vibey’ fiesta-inspired ambience, but for its playfully cheeky brand personality. So, our team is excited by the huge opportunities to have fun with the comms and really amplify the brand’s ‘flavour’. With the chain’s rapid growth, we’re really looking forward to playing a role in their continued success,” says Mc Creadie. Decimal Agency alongside Social Bite Media will be managing all creative content and community management across all Salsa’s social media, as well as all their other design work. “We are excited to be joining forces with Decimal Agency as we feel that their proposed brand communications strategy aligns well with our brand’s vision for 2019 and beyond,” said George Nicolopoulos, Salsa Mexican Grill Co-Founder.
