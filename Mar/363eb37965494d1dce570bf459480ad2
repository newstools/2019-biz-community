The liquor category is particularly progressive and dynamic with most major brands upgrading regularly – at least every five years on average – and the standard of premiumness continually being raised.When Harrier whisky approached packaging partners, Just Design, the brand had not had an upgrade in over 11 years. This was compounded by no investment in marketing over the same period, with the result being that the pack had become recessive on shelf and the brand had dropped off consumer’s radars.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/488696.jpg" alt="New heights for Harrier" width="500" height="562">The solution was to relook the packaging, benchmarking it against the modern competitive landscape and ensuring that it punches out on shelf. We took a responsible design approach, balancing modernity with recognisability; ultimately creating a more crafted and considered label that celebrates the owned assets, such as the harrier dog and wordmark. The audience is masculine, confident and associates whisky with premium cues – the pack responded in boldness and with an elevated status that clearly resonates with the market.Available in major retailers at R130 for 750ml, the new pack is attracting social interest and, without any additional support, sales have already increased by 11% since launch.About Just DesignFor 20 years, Just Design has proven time and again that good thinking leads to great creative.
