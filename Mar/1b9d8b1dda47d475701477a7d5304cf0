Insight Survey’s latest South African Coffee Landscape Report 2019 carefully unfolds the global and local coffee markets based on the latest information and research. It examines the market drivers and restraints as well as global and local market trends to present an objective insight into the current South African coffee industry environment, market dynamics and its forecasted future. In 2018, the retail value of the global coffee market was valued at an estimated US$88.0 billion and, is forecast to continue to grow at a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5%, between 2019 and 2023. Globally, coffee production is also estimated to reach a record 174.5 million 60kg bags in the 2018/2019 season, which represents an increase of 15.6 million 60kg bags compared to the 2017/2018 season. In terms of global coffee consumption, the three key global markets include the European Union, USA, and Brazil.

Through South Africa’s blossoming coffee culture, the Coffee market has developed to create its own identity. As stated by Iain Evans, event organiser of the Creative Coffee Week, the coffee industry in South Africa has matured and through innovation has created its own identity, carving a niche South African coffee market in the global coffee arena. This contention is further supported by Rithen Ramlal, co-founder of Kahvé Road, who stated that innovation is key in their coffee brand. Kahvé Road’s coffee capsules, for example, provide a unique blend of favours with their berry-flavoured Petra product as well as a Machu Picchu product which has a light citrus flavour. Innovation is not only limited to coffee, with companies also investing in innovative packaging. For example, Ella Cappuccino is available in a capsule that consumers only need to shake, remove the seal, and pour into a cup to enjoy. This innovation has created an efficient and convenient on-the-go coffee drink, ideal for the modern-day urban warrior with a high-paced lifestyle. Furthermore, the perfect innovation for sunny South Africa has been nitro cold brew, which is cold an unsweetened coffee. Nitro cold brew is typically made by soaking coffee grounds in cool filtered water for 24 hours. Numerous coffee shops in South Africa have started to follow this trend including Starbucks and Terbodore. Terbodore have gone one step further by marketing sparkling cold brew products that are available in a variety of unique flavours including marula, lemonade, as well as honey bush and orange.
