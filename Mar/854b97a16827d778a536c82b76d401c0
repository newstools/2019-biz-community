Because awareness is nothing without action.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/461580-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: SA's Standard Bank commits to global #HeForShe movement" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: SA's Standard Bank commits to global #HeForShe movementStandard Bank has firmed up South Africa's commitment to UN Women's #HeForShe movement.

We notice its absence and celebrate its presence. Balance drives a better working world. Let's all help create a #BalanceforBetter.Why we need to #BalanceforBetterIn this light, just last week saw the launch of Ad-women.com, a global register of female talent linked to the advertising industry.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/485993-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Global register of female talent in ad industry launches" width="120" height="120">Global register of female talent in ad industry launchesAd-women.com, a global register of female talent linked to the advertising industry has launched...7 Mar 2019Co-founder Lina Franzon explains:Women always have been a minority amongst the creatives at the agencies we’ve worked at, and female CEOs were something rare as we entered the industry. Today it’s finally beginning to change in Sweden but looking at it from a global perspective, men still dominated the highest paid positions. In this light, AdWeek reports that the launch comes on the heels of WPP’s 2018 gender wage gap report in the UK, which revealed that its median pay gap actually increased to 14.9% last year from 14.5% in 2017.UN Women confirms that while a little more than a decade remains to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, including Goal 5 on gender equality, all indications show that at the current pace of change, closing the global gender gap will take a staggering 108 years, and 202 years for economic gender parity.So it’ll take more than just a day of renewed focus to get this right.Locally, Standard Bank shares a promising angle, as Namibia and South Africa both score in the Top 20 in the WEF global report on gender equality at the moment, having closed 78% to 76% of their gender gaps, but sub-Saharan Africa still displays a wider range of gender gap outcomes than practically any other region.True state of the ‘equal rights, equal pay’ movementBut did you know that only six countries, all outside Africa, currently give women and men equal rights, according to the World Bank’s ‘Women, Business and the Law 2019’ report?Hence the launch of the W-Suite platform for advocacy and action, particularly aimed at bringing woman into key leadership and operational roles, particularly in the C-Suite across organisations, markets and governments, with an explicit goal of increasing the number of female CEOs of firms listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) by 10% before 2025.That’s a firm step in the right direction as we need not just better representation but better pay, and to make an effort not just on #InternationalWomensDay, but every day – that’s what #BalanceforBetter is all about.Click here to download the WEF’s Global Gender Gap Report 2018, as published in December 2018, and follow the W-Suite movement on Twitter or Instagram for the latest updates.
