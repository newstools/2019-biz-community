As the departure point for the range, the designers looked at modern urban rituals and their connection to socialising around food, indoor and outdoor living; and the rituals around expressing identity and sustainability. The results of this exploration include baskets made from faux hair braids, a bench designed to encourage socialising, and textiles inspired by the African environment.The ten African creatives responsible for the Överallt collection hail from various design disciplines – from fashion to sculpture and architecture. Two years ago, when Design Indaba was briefed by Ikea to source the designers for the project, Design Indaba founder Ravi Naidoo says they didn’t necessarily look at furniture designers, but instead picked “good thinkers”.“We were agnostic as to the medium and particular discipline, we just found people who were really going out there and doing the high-wire act, taking risks and expressing themselves, and represented the best of the African creative guard,” Naidoo explained when speaking at the launch event.The Överallt African design cohort is composed of: Issa Diabaté, Selly Raby Kane, Naeem Biviji and Bethan Rayner, Bibi Seck, Mariam Hazem and Hend Riad, Renee Rossouw, Sindiso Khumalo and Laduma Ngxokolo. They’re also all alumni of the Design Indaba platform in some shape or form.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/485361.jpg" alt="#DesignIndaba2019: Ikea's Överallt collection a global showcase of Africa's top design talent" width="620" height="373">Democratic designAlso present at the Cape Town launch event was Ikea creative leader James Futcher, who spearheaded the Överallt project. He said that the furniture giant wanted the design collaboration to be a learning and sharing process for all those involved. “The idea was that we learn from these great African designers, and they learn how we work at Ikea. It’s very much a mashup of Ikea Scandinavian design with great African design,” Futcher said.The designers from Africa contributed their ideas for the collection while the designers from Ikea guided the development process. All of the Överallt products were developed with Ikea in-house designers Johanna Jelinek, Kevin Gouriou, Hanna Dalrot, Mikael Axelsson and Ina Vuorivirta.“Our role from Ikea has been to show and lead the way in making products that are suitable for mass-production. That was a learning for the guest designers,” according to Jelinek.A large percentage of Ikea products sell an average of 2 million units worldwide. For the group of African creatives, who mostly run boutique operations that make small lines in limited numbers, the idea of ‘scaling up’ presented the first major hurdle for the designers, Naidoo said. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/485376.jpg" alt="#DesignIndaba2019: Ikea's Överallt collection a global showcase of Africa's top design talent" width="620" height="466">Another key lesson for them was the need to adhere to the “democratic design” principles that underpin Ikea products. “It's not about just making beautiful products with a great form. At Ikea it's so important that we have a great function. If it's something we're going to be sitting on, it needs to be comfortable,” explained Futcher. “And then it's about quality - picking the right material so it lasts over time. And sustainability… how can we limit our impact on the environment? But the biggest thing that we wanted to share with the designers is that we at Ikea want to make design accessible to the many people, and it's about having products at a great low price.”Africa’s time is nowIn his opening statement at the event, Naidoo said that Ikea – like many others outside of the African continent – is perceiving an African cultural moment. “They're interested in what's rising from the tarmac here in Africa and could feel the sense of a coming-out parade of African creativity. They wanted to capture this in some way.”“Africa is now. Our time has come,” Naidoo exclaimed.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/480598-120x120.jpg?1" alt="Ikea's African Överallt collection to be unveiled at Design Indaba Festival" width="120" height="120">Ikea's African Överallt collection to be unveiled at Design Indaba FestivalTwo years ago Ikea teamed up with a group of designers, architects, artists and creatives from five African countries to collaborate around modern urban rituals and the importance they play in the home...1 Feb 2019The idea of outdoor living is also a strong theme for the Överallt collection, one that emerged at a workshop during the early stages of the product development process.“We sat down during a workshop and we shared stories from our every day," said Naidoo. "One thing that emerged is that there was a merger between the inside and the outside and so much about that African experience is in that interstitial space between the front door and the street. So a fair bit of the collection represents outdoor living.”Collection highlightsThe idea behind Bibi Seck’s rocking chair and footrest was born while he was sitting in his mother’s garden in Dakar, Senegal. In Western Africa, where he grew up, there’s a more reflective attitude towards time; space to sit in stillness, reflect and allow thoughts to flow freely.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/485377.jpg" alt="#DesignIndaba2019: Ikea's Överallt collection a global showcase of Africa's top design talent" width="620" height="484">Selly Raby Kane's product is inspired by the tradition of weaving hair.
