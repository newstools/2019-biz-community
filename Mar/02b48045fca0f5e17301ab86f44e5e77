Stop feeling luckySaying your role is based on luck implies you didn’t do anything to earn it.Ampah echoes the thinking of Shonda Rhimes’ Year of Yes in this regard – acknowledge that you are smart and talented and bravely on this FOD path – it’s not about luck.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/488590.jpg" alt="One of Ampah's slides from her Women in Tech Africa presentation." width="625" height="351">One of Ampah's slides from her Women in Tech Africa presentation.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/488606.jpg?2" alt="One of Ampah's slides from her Women in Tech Africa presentation." width="625" height="325">One of Ampah's slides from her Women in Tech Africa presentation.2. Take advantage of opportunities that come your wayStart with your passion and realise that activity does not mean productivity. Don’t just focus on the big projects as the small ones can be equally important. In balancing the big and small and working smarter not harder, you’ll reap the benefits.3. Strategic visibility mattersEspecially when working on passion projects, there’s a fine balance between being seen and being heard. Ampah says to learn to give great presentations and briefs, to volunteer for corporate events and raise your hand to contribute.4. Be a repository of knowledgeInvest in yourself and your own learning and share what you’ve learned. There’s no space for queen bee syndrome.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1808/452598-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: Code-switching and dealing with queen bees in the workplace" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Code-switching and dealing with queen bees in the workplaceThe negative impact of code-switching and tokenism, why females speak almost three times as many words a day as men and how to deal with queen bees in the workplace were hot topics at the most recent Future Females Cape Town morning session. Here's what you missed...By Leigh Andrews 13 Aug 20185. Visibility doesn’t mean saying ‘Yes’ all the timeAmpah loves the Warren Buffett quote that the difference between successful people and very successful people is that very successful people say ‘no’ to almost everything. Say it with justification and you will gain respect, similarly, if you ask for help with justification, you will be appreciated.6. Claim and document your successIf you don’t control the narrative in this regard, somebody else will. Ampah says to learn to use social media to share lessons you’ve learned – the good and the challenging alike – and to share your success with management so they can advocate for you.7. Hang around long enough and there will be failure…But learn to embrace it with dignity to grow resilience, as failure or mistake is a perception.

Adapt, learn and draw lessons.8. Be prepared for difficult conversationsThese are usually around salaries, promotions and feedback.Data is your best ally so prepare and do your research, provide solutions, raise your hand and negotiate.9. Mentors and sponsors are criticalHardly anyone rises fast without mentors and sponsors so, identify those who have been there before you and are willing to help.10. Having mentees is even more importantGive back and bring along other women, as ‘the FOD path’ is lonely. Take mentoring and coaching classes and also volunteer to mentor others.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1807/447668-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Think Creative Hub's cofounders and creative directors Nkgabiseng 'Nkgabi' Motau and Mukondi Ralushayi." width="120" height="120">#Mandela100: The Madiba magic of mentoringThink Creative Hub's cofounders and creative directors Nkgabiseng 'Nkgabi' Motau and Mukondi Ralushayi explain the importance of being both a mentor and mentee...By Leigh Andrews 5 Jul 201811. Networking can open doorsThis is a good way to bring value to your career so sign up for those networking events and meet others on a similar path to your own.12. Don’t be afraid to take risksGive yourself options and remember that best opportunities come when you demonstrate courage.Ampah’s final words of encouragement?From one badass to another, don’t settle.
