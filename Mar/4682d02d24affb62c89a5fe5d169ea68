For example, if someone reads a piece put out by a company that sells retirement annuities, which makes them afraid that they have not saved enough for their retirement, they will be more likely to investigate the retirement annuity policies that the company has to offer.The same principle applies to social media. Conversations which appeal to people’s emotions are more likely to get them to engage with you, your company and/or your brand. There are a number of metrics that you can use to measure how engaged people are with your brand on social media as well as what messaging engages them most. These are the metrics you should be measuring in 2019.CommentsComments are self-explanatory. These are where a social media user takes the time to comment, with their own viewpoints, on your social media post. “These are important to measure,” says Lisa Schneider: managing director of the Digital School of Marketing, “as this is a true reflection of how engaged people are with your content because they’ve taken the time to digest what you’ve said and have put thought into a response to you.”To calculate your company’s engagement levels, pick a metric that is important to your business and that you will gauge your social media success by. For example, if the goal of your social media strategy is to get clicks to your website, tally up the number of clicks that a particular social media campaign generates. Divide the result by the reach and you will arrive at the engagement score.Mentions Similar to comments, mentions are where people will draw someone into a conversation on social media. These are significant to measure because they show you who exactly is worrying about your brand’s opinion and what the demographics of these people are. This is valuable target market research for you as you will be able to use the data you gather from this activity and will be able to target these audiences in other campaigns.SharesLastly, it’s vital to measure shares as this shows how far your content has reached or spread. This is important as it will show you how large your potential audience is.An accredited social media course will teach you a lot more about how to measure social media engagement for your business.
