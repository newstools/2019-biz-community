<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/489588-625x417.jpg" alt="Massiv Metro gets a Liberty Radio Awards nomination" width="625" height="417">Presented by radio aficionados Queen of Pitori, B00-C, The Usual Suspect and DJ Duzy, the three-hour show which broadcasts from 19h00-22h00 on Fridays and Saturdays focuses on DJ culture, house music and, of course, getting you ready for your weekend. "It feels amazing to be nominated; we're grateful for the platform and it's great to know that there's great opportunity for the #WeekendSpecial movement," said an excited Queen of Pitori, whose real name is Busisiwe Khanyile. Station Manager Faith Mangope echoes these sentiments and adds that the nomination is testament to "the impact we have not only on our listeners but South Africans who really want to hear Rocking, Real and Relevant content." "It also speaks to the commitment that has been displayed by our talent and our team members to see this platform work. We are absolutely proud of The Weekend Special," she adds. The show is one of its kind, with a strong focus on DJ culture, especially the lost art of DJ'ing with vinyl records, "which was believed to be dead," explains DJ Duzy - real name Mduduzi Tsosane. "We're bringing it back and also reviving the spark from all the DJs who were believed to be yesteryear news, but are the pillar and cornerstone of our current industry." As far as the kind of the music that you can expect when you plug in on a Friday and Saturday, Vuyani Kafile, who is known as The Usual Suspect, says house music has a strong presence in the offering. "It's mainly house music-based and looks at the genre across the globe, not just in South Africa. The show is structured to entertain, educate and unite in music."  He adds that focusing on women in the space is also important to the team with most of their profile interviews being of phenomenal women in the space. The Weekend Special is the first Massiv Metro show to be nominated at the prestigious awards.
