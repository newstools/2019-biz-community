Despite each facing controversy in their sporting careers, they're all stars in Nike's inspirational 30th-anniversary campaign, filled with fiery new words to live by...By Leigh Andrews 17 Sep 2018Now, Muse by Clio explains that Nike’s follow-up commercial by Wieden+Kennedy, titled ‘Dream Crazier’ and this time narrated by Serena Williams, aired on Sunday during the Oscars and serves as “a stirring salute to women athletes.”Going beyond the ‘dream crazy’ scope of dreaming of achieving greatness in sports when the stacks are against you is ‘dream crazier’, which shows how passionately pursuing sports tends to put females at risk of being labelled as ‘crazy’.  Featuring such female sports stars as Olympic-gold-medal-winning gymnast Simone Biles, sabre fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, Williams’ voice-over during the scenes of Semenya’s success says it best – “When we’re too good, there’s something wrong with us.” But who says so? Why does being labelled as 'crazy' have to be a bad thing?Show them what crazy can do!Dream crazier also highlights the importance of reframing the world’s interpretation of mental health issues. The ad also, therefore, works to destigmatise the way we classify someone as 'crazy'. Williams urges: If we show emotion, we're called dramatic. If we want to play against men, we're nuts. And if we dream of equal opportunity, we're delusional. When we stand for something, we're unhinged. When we're too good, there's something wrong with us. And if we get angry, we're hysterical, irrational, or just being crazy.But a woman running a marathon was crazy. A woman boxing was crazy. A woman dunking, crazy. Coaching an NBA team, crazy. A woman competing in a hijab; changing her sport; landing a double-cork 1080; or winning 23 grand slams, having a baby, and then coming back for more, crazy, crazy, crazy, and crazy. So if they want to call you crazy, fine. Show them what crazy can do.Hear, hear. Go out there and 'be crazy' about your passions.Of course, there’s always more to be done in attaining true inclusivity… But the ad has since been dubbed the best moment from the Oscars 2019, and we can see why. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/483864-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: How the Hollywood diversity problem is slowly improving" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: How the Hollywood diversity problem is slowly improvingSince the #OscarsSoWhite tweet from a few years ago, there's been increased awareness of the lack of diversity, equality and inclusion in the global film and TV industry overall, but has there been any action?
