Also known for taking the last official portrait of Nelson Mandela and creating the 21 Icons project, the photographer has always pursued stories with purpose. The Queen’s honour was bestowed on Steirn for his voluntary efforts to campaign for wildlife conservation. “To be awarded the Points of Light award is a great accolade and I deeply appreciate it,” Steirn says. “It is an award that represents communities of people that have touched me over the last decade of photographing Africa and speaks back to the value of our natural world and platforms such as Beautiful News.” Beautiful News South Africa is a multimedia platform that publishes stories of hope and optimism every single day without fail. The films, photographic essays and articles have revolutionised the view of South Africa by offering a powerful counter-narrative to the negativity portrayed by mainstream media. The impact of Beautiful News has been extensive, with a reach of over a billion within the past two years. Steirn’s devotion to documenting the goodness in humanity and the significance of the natural world offers insight into the importance of our coexistence for future generations. The issues facing our world are more complex than they appear, and require careful, nuanced storytelling. By sharing the efforts of ordinary people, raising awareness, and initiating necessary conversations, Beautiful News is driving the way forward.
