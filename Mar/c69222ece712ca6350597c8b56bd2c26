You’ll get a reminder to tune in on 14 March 2019 and when the event is about to start on the day. Wait for the broadcast to start, then click “Share” and “Start Watch Party” from within the feed. This is the first time the IMC Conference has offered this kind of online accessibility. “By hosting a “Watch Party” on the day, you’ll have full access to the line-up of 20 industry experts sharing key insights right from your phone, PC or smart TV.
