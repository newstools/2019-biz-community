They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982. Several films, including Muriel’s Wedding and The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert featured ABBA’s music in their soundtracks. The musical Mamma Mia!, inspired by the music of ABBA, was released in 2008 and became the highest-grossing film in the UK that year. A sequel, Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, was released in 2018. They’ve released countless hits, including Mamma Mia, Thank You For The Music, Dancing Queen, Waterloo, Chiquitita and many, many more.
