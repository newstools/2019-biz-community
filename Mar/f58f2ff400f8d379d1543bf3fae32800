Particularly when you think about the fact that the industry felt fit to reward those ads publicly.He called it clear and concerning evidence of unconscious gender bias being rife in the advertising industry.Overall, what marketers are getting wrong ties in with Southgate’s definition of not being progressive: reinforcing rather than helping to eradicate harmful gender-based stereotypes. Luckily the Unstereotype Alliance, launched at the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity in 2017, is set to get this back on firm footing.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/444022-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: All you need to know to #unstereotype advertising" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: All you need to know to #unstereotype advertisingThe Unstereotype Alliance launched at Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity last year and has just joined Twitter...By Leigh Andrews 11 Jun 2018Ostler said to get it right you need to address your targeting. It’s not that marketers ignore women, though – on a whole, they tend to target more women than men. Unfortunately, lots of that targeting is based on gender stereotypes.Ad touchpoint 1: Gender targetingFor example, females are over targeted for laundry, baby products and household products. This may be insulting to men, who have opinions on these topics, and women don’t want to be solely responsible for it – vice versa on automobiles. Making progress in targeting can be as simple as challenging out-of-date and simplistic assumptions.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/469354.jpg" alt="South Africa's new generation of dads are cool, committed and in charge" width="120" height="120">South Africa's new generation of dads are cool, committed and in chargeHere are some revealing facts about our country's fathers from GFK Consumer Life, an annual longitudinal survey based on face-to-face interviews with a representative sample of connected, urban South African consumers...By Rachel Thompson, Issued by GfK South Africa 16 Nov 2018Kantar’s Connected Life research shows increasing numbers of both genders now claim responsibility for grocery purchasing in most countries across the globe, with Kantar’s BrandZ analysis from 2017 and 2018 showing that gender-balanced brands are more valued than gender-neutral brands and that too many brands show a traditional gender skew. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1807/447821-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Beyond pink and blue: the quiet rise of gender-neutral toys" width="120" height="120">Beyond pink and blue: the quiet rise of gender-neutral toysAmid a downturn in global toy sales, Australia's Toys 'R' Us stores going into voluntary administration and closure of the firm's American and UK arms, a quiet revolution is under way in the toy world...By Jason Bainbridge 5 Jul 2018For example, in 2014 Home Depot’s brand power was stronger amongst men but fast-forward to 2019 and that’s no longer the case, as the brand has since made a concerted effort to also target female buyers.Ad touchpoint 2: Gender portrayals in ad contentSouthgate added that how women and men are portrayed in ads plays a big role in how well those ads work, too – obviously, it’s not that women don’t appear in ads, it’s that where both genders appear in an ad, the men tend to be more prominent while the women shown are usually shown as caring and likeable but in a background role. On the consequences of feminism in advertising, Southgate says not to go overboard as you need to display concepts of strength, caring and respect in positive female portrayals without being too aggressive in this regard in your brand portrayal. For example, in 2017, Nike in Russia’s ‘Believe in More’ campaign successfully balanced concepts of brand strength and sensitivity by modifying expectations of ‘what are girls made of’, beyond gossip and marmalade... That was a win, as there’s no denying it’s tricky to get a female portrayal right, but positive, progressive portrayals of males can be just as tricky, as we saw with the heated debate and controversy that followed Gillette’s recent #WeBelieve campaign:<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477699-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Gillette's 'We Believe' ad receives mixed feedback" width="120" height="120">Gillette's 'We Believe' ad receives mixed feedbackNEWSWATCH: Gillette has released a #MeToo-inspired ad called 'We Believe' that plays on its 30-year old tagline, 'Best a Man Can Get' to help put an end to 'toxic masculinity'...15 Jan 2019But working on accurate, positive gender portrayal isn’t just a nice to have – it has a strong correlation with ad effectiveness and builds brand affinity.On how ad response varies by gender, and implications for creative development, Ostler said recent neuroscience learnings suggest there’s only 8% difference between the male and female brain.According to the Link database, women are slightly more likely than men to prefer ads that feature children and well-known music – but that difference is only 3% to 4%. So there’s no such thing as a formula to predict whether a specific ad will perform better amongst women and men.Ad touchpoint 3: The cultural delicacy of getting the cultural nodWhile humour works well in getting both genders to feel more positive towards a brand, remember that you’ll need to navigate sociocultural awareness, too. What may be seen as a bold statement in your country may not be seen as being bold or culturally sensitive elsewhere, and vice versa. See the two gender-positive ads below as examples of this: Be aware that going too far, too fast in a way that’s inconsistent with your current messaging also puts you at risk of progressive backlash.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1808/451750-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Ming-Cheau Lin.

Ad touchpoint 4: Gender placementSouthgate said gender is a readily available targeting variable, and you can fine-tune it even after the ad is live, especially with digital ads, but even with optimising gender portrayals to maximise creative response, all isn’t quite rosy in the digital garden. Note that in-market media placement factors like targeting receptivity may bring down the effectiveness of digital ads.For example, women tend to be less impressed by targeted ads as well as unskippable preview ads. The AdReaction findings showed that word-of-mouth marketing and point-of-sale also does better than online advertising with women, while websites and reviews did better for men. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1807/449892-120x120.png?2" alt="Makhathini in action at Kantar Millward Brown's offices in the Foreshore." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Unboxing diversity in advertising'Thinking outside the box' is a good way to improve your creativity skills.
