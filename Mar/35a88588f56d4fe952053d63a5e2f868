"In February 2010, I received a surprising phone call from a potential client. It was the shortest sales call of my life, made particularly unusual, because I barely said anything. The woman on the other side of the phone simply said: "I have read your blog posts, listened to your podcasts, and I know you are right for the job. How much do you charge, and can I book you for next month?”"I ended the call, happy for another consulting engagement, and thinking that the whole thing must have been a bit of a fluke. "A few months later, I received another surprising phone call. This time, from the Presidency of South Africa. They said they had done their research and decided that I was the most knowledgeable expert in the field they needed assistance with, and would like to book some time with me. "Later that year, after starting my digital agency, DigitLab, I received the third surprising phone call. It was from a bigger digital agency. They told me they’d seen my work, been impressed by it, and wanted me to consider opening their Durban office. I ended up turning down that opportunity simply because I realised how much I love working for myself and didn’t want to report to anyone else in the future."All of this happened within the first year of being on my own. I went from a nobody in my industry, to a somebody in less than 12 months. "It was not because I was smarter than my competitors, or because I had money to spend on public relations - at this point I was struggling to pay my salary, let alone a public relations manager. As best as I could figure out, the difference lay in my relentless pursuit to build a personal brand online."Renowned is for anyone who wants to unlock the power in their network by leveraging the online world. If you have a sale to make, a business to build, a promotion to get, a message to share or a movement to start, this book will help you amplify and accelerate the work you do.Mike has spent the last 12 months detailing his experiences in building a powerful online personal brand in this book.
