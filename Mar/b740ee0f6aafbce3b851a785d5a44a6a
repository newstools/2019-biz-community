We filled our BrandingBoards in Makro stores, Indoor/Outdoor MegaBoards and aisle branding in our wholesale Cash ‘n Carry stores, as well as MegaStatics and MegaPaves at our Pick n Pay stores. The result is breathtaking. Grand-Pa really does take centre stage with their striking artwork, which looks amazing throughout some of our 20,000 diversified managed media spaces. Following this hugely successful campaign, MegaVision Media looks forward to working with GSK and their powerful brands in the future.
