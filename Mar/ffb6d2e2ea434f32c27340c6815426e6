I actually started out as an intern at Pernod Ricard’s KZN sales office, though I joined Pernod Ricard officially in 2013, as an on-trade sales representative. I then worked my way up to regional events manager, before taking a side-step into marketing, where I see myself ultimately playing a key role within the group. I guess from day one the goal was always to join the marketing team. I knew what my goal was and I didn’t allow anything to deter me from reaching it..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any career highlights you’re particularly proud of? Being offered the position of brand manager: single malts is undoubtedly my proudest career moment. Another was during my time as assistant brand manager for Ballantine’s Whisky – our team won the Campaign of the Year Award at our annual conference for Boiler Room X Ballantine’s True Music Africa.

I’m really looking forward to The Glenlivet JazzTown which we are taking to the  Durban July again this year. We’re working on a stellar stage lineup and an exceptional hospitality experience for our guests, and it’s bound to be an amazing success. My plan is to take The Glenlivet JazzTown to cities that it hasn’t been before, to bring the jazz lifestyle experience to new communities where we would love to welcome new friends of the brand to the Glenlivet family. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1801/425047-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Glenlivet to bring jazz to Sun Met with its JazzTown Marquee" width="120" height="120">Glenlivet to bring jazz to Sun Met with its JazzTown MarqueeGlenlivet Whisky will introduce the Glenlivet JazzTown Marquee at the 2018 Sun Met.
