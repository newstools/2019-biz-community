We work together when the project allows us to offer an integrated campaign,” she explains.Other services include setting up productions and facilitating post-production for TV commercials, digital content, films and photography.Further to this, the company seeks to drive transformation and youth development, employing black directors and photographers in line with the percentage of the country’s demographics. “Transformation for me in the production industry doesn't end with me being a black female nor my film directors and photographers being black. It needs to filter to the crew we also employ,” she clarifies. “My mandate is to always ensure that our call sheet is 60% to 80% black, mirroring the demographic make-up of our country and where there are none, I will always encourage my white crew to bring on board a young black, preferably female crew member that they are training.”She recently told iDidTht.com that this company is for the future creatives of South Africa. “I want to create a home for them, an institution to grow their talents, a space to push themselves in the industry. Osu is a company that can and will provide people with more than just the opportunity to further their career, but with hope as well. I want to shape the company so that it can start shaping the industry positively.”Here, Bosman explains the model in more detail and, having started the business just a few weeks after giving birth, goes on to say that she’s particularly proud to be showing the industry, as a new mother, that women can build such institutions whilst breastfeeding….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What sparked the idea to start a creative/commercials production company?When I was a TV producer at ad agencies, my job was to find suitable suppliers to produce and execute certain creative concepts. With digital being on the rise back then, I saw the need for a different way of thinking and working and so I decided to leave my salary-driven life to starting a production company. This pushed me to find the talent that was needed to produce commercial content that is integrated..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How did you come up with the name?I started my new company a few weeks after giving birth to my son. I didn't have much time to think of ‘tricksy’ names that sounded like a fruit or an object and I also found myself thinking along the lines of building a legacy for my child but also for the future of this industry.I remember my son smiled at me when I was registering the company online. His name in Japanese means to push/persevere/strive and so I decided to 'lend' his name – Osu. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Describe the model.We have film directors that direct both traditional TV ads and also digital content and we also have photographers.

This is key. In the short space of time that we’ve been running, we had to fast-track this relationship by taking on jobs that either had very little time or little money. In both instances, when you are a small shop, you need to prove to clients that you can deliver.Risk-taking is also another challenge, especially where cash flow is concerned. I had to learn very quickly to make friends with my bank account and manage my cash flow. Even with an accountant, you as the business owner need to develop a respectful relationship with your cash flow. If you don't, then you will burn yourself and this will affect your company in a big way..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most proud of and why?I am proud of our company and what we have achieved in such a short space of time. I am proud to see how much our talents have grown, the work they’ve produced and the lives we’ve changed. We have opened doors to black talent who have been knocking to get into the industry. I am also glad to see more production companies doing the same. This shows that the production industry is furthering transformation in their own companies, training their new directors, etc. IEC Xse:Lion Lager:Lethabo:.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}In light of International Women’s Day earlier this month, why are you particularly proud of your company being 100% black female-owned?I am proud of being a businesswoman who is fulfilling my personal mandate to provide opportunities for other people.
