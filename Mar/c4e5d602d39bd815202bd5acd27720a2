It isn’t something we pull out of the workflow chart at Stage 4 to add some colour to a client presentation.“At Publicis Machine, we employ creative thinking at every level, solving brand problems with unique solutions that work, and with an intent of them working well,” he says.Here, he tells us that it’s the people – the team and their partners – that excite him most about where the agency is going and his instrumental part in 'leading the change'….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How do you feel about your appointment from group executive director into a dual role as MD and CCO?Excited for the challenge. Having led the agency from a creative point of view, it felt like a natural evolution to move toward having discussions with clients around solving their business challenges, while still leading product creativity within Publicis Machine.

Our strong agency culture we have built over the last six years has really been a defining factor in our success. Our agency wouldn’t be on the radar if not for the passionate and driven people on our team.I’m excited to be part of this constantly evolving industry, and to be instrumental in leading the changes within the agency. I believe it’s our ability to constantly adapt that has led to our evolving into a true brand experience agency. We solve brand problems with unique solutions that really work, and that makes us unique as an agency. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about your career in general and the creative industry in particular?I really enjoy getting to know the workings of multiple industries, what makes them tick.

Technology is challenging how we think and also how we best use it to further success..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us a bit about your experience and what you hope to achieve in your new position(s).I came from a big brand creative thinking background and joined a bunch of young, forward-thinking guys to form Machine back in 2012. Embracing a born-from-digital approach we grew the agency quite quickly and we were acquired by Publicis in 2012 to form Publicis Machine. Looking back on this journey, from where we are to now, I can clearly see how being creatively-minded has been the momentum behind our success. Placing this at the core of everything we do will continue to be the future of successes.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1607/349943-120x120.png?2" alt="#CannesLions2016: Be proud, be brave, be pioneering" width="120" height="120">#CannesLions2016: Be proud, be brave, be pioneeringGareth McPherson, ECD at Publicis Machine, shares insights gleaned from the calibre of work awarded top accolades on the recent global advertising awards circuit, and shares advice on making sure we bring home more of those big wins next year...By Leigh Andrews 4 Jul 2016<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1712/423287-120x120.jpg" alt="Eales, Rossiter and McPherson with their 2017 Loeries wins." width="120" height="120">#LoeriesRanking with...
