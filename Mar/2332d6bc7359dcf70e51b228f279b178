Over the past two weeks, Kfm has run a cryptic PR and marketing campaign around the announcement of the new Sunday line-up, and specifically the new Sunday breakfast show host. On the back of this, Kfm 94.5 has become a big talking point around the water-cooler, intrigued radio circles, and has had social media abuzz with conversation around who the person will be to take the microphone at the Cape’s biggest radio station. “As a brand we are continually looking to innovate and find ways of connecting with our audience – both on- and off-air. Authentic storytelling is critical to the way we communicate with the people of the Cape. We are excited to welcome Saskia Falken back to the airwaves. Saskia has a unique connection with the people of the Western Cape, and we believe she will bring a fresh yet familiar feel to our Sunday offering,” said Stephen Werner, Programme Manager for Kfm 94.5 Werner added: “Saskia Falken, Brandon Leigh, Tim Thabethe and Mamohau Seseane are incredible talents, and we have no doubt that our refreshed Sunday line-up together with our Most Music offering will provide listeners with the perfect soundtrack to Sundays in the Cape.”“Working behind the scenes at Kfm 94.5, I am keenly aware of the passion the station has for the city, the province and its people, and when the opportunity to return to a seat behind the microphone, I was unable to resist returning to my first love. Sundays in Cape Town represents family time, an opportunity to unwind, and renew energies for the week ahead and most importantly starting your day with a city staple: koeksisters and coffee. I look forward to welcoming the Kfm audience into ‘easy Sunday mornings’," said new Sunday breakfast show host, Saskia Falken.Kfm 94.5’s new Sunday line-up from 31 March 2019:Sunday 7am – 10am		Sunday Breakfast with Saskia Falken10am – 3pm		Sundays with Brandon Leigh3pm – 7pm 		Sundays with Tim Thabethe 7pm - 10pm		Kfm Sunday Love Songs with Mamohau SeseaneFor the latest news and information from Kfm 94.5 visit: www.kfm.co.za
