Eleven-year-old Hannah Rupping's performance with Kurt Darren. Rupping who lives in Stellenbosch won the Kfm Mornings on-air Kaptein singing contest and wowed the crowd with her musical prowess. Kfm 94.5's own Brandon Leigh kept the crowd moving with stellar mixes in between the different musical acts.
