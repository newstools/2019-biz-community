<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/487143.jpg" alt="Cilla Thompson" width="302" height="450">Cilla ThompsonThompson describes the team as a one-stop marketing machine with top industry talent in PR, digital, web, creative and print. “As the oldest person working here – having been in the industry for years – these young and vibey colleagues are giving me a run for my money.”Here, she tells us more about how she’s finding working with such a young yet knowledgeable team and that all the office is missing is literally a pool and a flamingo. Oh and that she’s rubbed shoulders with David Beckham and Antonio Banderas. Need I say more?.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How do you feel about your appointment? It takes a lot of getting used to. For 17 years I had been on the media-owner side dealing with media agencies. I thought I knew it all.I joined Brand Cartel on 7 February 2019, so it’s still very fresh but I'm loving it and getting into the swing of things..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about your career, the print media industry and sales/client service in particular?I will always be a print girl, I guess my age proves that. Sales is what I know best. I am not a hardcore salesperson at all; client relationships are how I have got myself to where I am today and the things I have accomplished in my career of sales/client service. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us a bit about your experience, what you bring to the agency and what you hope to achieve in your new position.As mentioned above, I have built amazing relationships in the 17 years of me being in the media industry and this goes a long way. I have met the most amazing influential people and through their trust in me, I know they will either follow me or in recent cases, introduce me to big players in the industry where I can seek new business.It’s not always what your business has to offer, it’s you as a person and the trust the client has in you that then starts the journey with whatever business direction you choose to take..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any career highlights you’re particularly proud of?Am I allowed to brag? Well, I'm going to anyway. I got to spend two days with David Beckham for a cover shoot for Destiny Man magazine as well as Antonio Banderas. That was the highlight of my career..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to?The challenge. Brand Cartel is nothing like any other agencies I have known. They are young, yet full of knowledge and creativity. We won’t even talk about their digital knowledge; it’s mind-blowing and I am like a sponge learning every day from people half my age.I feel like I am at a home away from home – the vibe is so chilled never mind the scenic office we have that literally is missing a pool and a flamingo.I have never seen so many briefs coming in for new business as far as the UK and the US that have heard about Brand Cartel and wish to work with us. I have already signed on a very influential client and I look forward to growing this business into the fields I know best, so I have to hush a bit and you’re going to have to wait and see.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/472622-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Warren captions this: “The work never stops at the Brand Cartel.”" width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with...
