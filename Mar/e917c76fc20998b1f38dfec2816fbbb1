Bye #Capetown and thank you for having me @YPO @YPOEdge! I saw a different side of CEOs this week. Very educational. Sorry to have missed YOUR talk, @Trevornoah ����#YPOEDGE pic.twitter.com/6OuB2FVExk— Manoush Zomorodi (@manoushz) March 7, 2019You may have noticed a rise in the amount of podcasts on offer at the moment. They appeal to today’s constantly distracted consumer, as you can stream them live while working, or download to listen while on your commute or even while exercising after hours. It’s an interesting move as most media are suffering from ‘split-screen status’ at the moment. The fact that it’s 0% visual and 100% sound-based could be the reason why.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1712/423519-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Leigh Andrews, editor-in-chief of marketing and media at Bizcommunity." width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2018: Rewind from attention spam back to attention spanOne of the biggest trends we're set to see this year is a plethora of marketing messages facing ever-decreasing attention from consumers.

Meet Manoush, the modern-day mom-journalistWhile filling that modern-day journalist role as well as author and founder of her own entrepreneurial passion project, Stable Genius Productions, she says that work-life balance is a daily struggle, but the hardest part is balancing her parenting demands, which she describes as “a whole other job in itself.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/476609.jpg" alt="#RecruitmentFocus: 7 reasons to incorporate a flexible work culture" width="120" height="120">#RecruitmentFocus: 7 reasons to incorporate a flexible work cultureThe world of work as we know it is changing.

It was about having control over their home schedules while also taking advantage of the amazing moment that podcasting is in right now. Why we’re in the podcasting momentINMA confirms: "The true value in this compelling content is in reinforcing the value of excellence in journalism and excellent storytelling. [Podcasters] are helping reconnect listeners to the value of journalism — the importance of the craft in exposing truth, challenging norms, and holding officials accountable."Zomorodi herself has been on the traditional broadcasting road for 20-odd years and has never seen such a connection between host and listeners as you do with podcasting.It’s an incredibly intimate medium, which makes telling stories that way all the more impactful.
