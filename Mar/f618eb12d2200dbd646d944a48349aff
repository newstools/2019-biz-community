HKLM tapped into this powerful brand heritage, and conceptualised an updated visual language that was fresh and dynamic, but still retained this valuable brand equity.An important aspect of the rebrand was that the new visual identity had to work well across all media platforms, from print to digital and film. Explains Gary Harwood, HKLM director: “The logo and colours associated with the Glo brand haven’t changed in 16 years, but what has evolved during this time is the company’s communications strategy. It has moved from being largely print and TV-based to digital, so it was critical that the new branding would work optimally on digital media platforms.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/485583-625x292.jpg" alt="HKLM delivers fresh new branding for Nigeria's telecoms giant, Glo" width="625" height="292">The rebrand was undertaken in conjunction with a range of local Nigerian agency partners, pointing to HKLM’s strength of easily integrating its extensive branding knowledge and understanding of a local market with the insights of local experts.“Glo is HKLM’s longest-standing client; it was the first agency client we signed when we opened our doors in South Africa 16 years ago. Conversely, HKLM is Glo’s longest-standing branding and communications partner. We have lived the journey with this brand from inception to the heights that the company has reached today,” adds Harwood.The rebrand included an extensive photo shoot to provide exclusive imagery to be used in campaigns across all platforms, the first of which are currently being rolled out in Nigeria and Ghana.
