But where does he turn for support, when his inspiration well turns dry?Barty shares that he became part of YPO 12 years ago, having been invited by a CEO client who was a member and thought it would be good for him to join, so he did – as simple as that. So Barty has been an active member for a while now, on and off because how active you want to be as a YPO member is entirely dependent on you. The power of networking and learning from shared experienceAs a result, Barty has led a mentorship portfolio, as that’s his passion, and he was part of the YPO members’ leadership team for a while. He’s far too busy for that now, given his additional roles at King James Group and as the ACA chairperson, so is no longer as active as before. But mentorship still matters to him, as well as the idea that the core of YPO is really founded around the idea of forum.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1807/447668-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Think Creative Hub's cofounders and creative directors Nkgabiseng 'Nkgabi' Motau and Mukondi Ralushayi." width="120" height="120">#Mandela100: The Madiba magic of mentoringThink Creative Hub's cofounders and creative directors Nkgabiseng 'Nkgabi' Motau and Mukondi Ralushayi explain the importance of being both a mentor and mentee...By Leigh Andrews 5 Jul 2018Barty explains that a YPO forum, in particular, is effectively your personal external team, through which you share power, knowledge, experience, criticism and debate – the good and the bad. That’s Barty’s YPO journey so far, so while he’s not a very public member of YPO – in fact, this was his first media interview focused on his YPO membership – he derives lots of great value from it.For example, when we chatted on the first morning of this year’s YPO Edge conference, Barty shares that it had been a “really cool morning” so far. He found the sessions not just inspiring but also emotional as the speakers were sharing visceral talks about shared experience, which he find to be far more impactful than just learning facts. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/486001-120x120.jpg?2" alt="How Cape Town's YPO 2019 brings meaning to a 'Life of Re' for creative CEOs" width="120" height="120">How Cape Town's YPO 2019 brings meaning to a 'Life of Re' for creative CEOsYPO hosted the world's largest gathering of CEOs right here in Cape Town on 6 and 7 March 2019, for its Global Leadership Conference and YPO Edge, with the theme, 'Life of Re'. Here's how the C-Suite in general and media creative specifically can take the theme to heart and make a difference through positive change in society beyond the bottom line...By Leigh Andrews 8 Mar 2019 It’s about asking yourself what you can learn from someone else’s experience, and especially for the members who don’t belong to global networks with international offices, there’s another highlight in tapping into the considerable networking opportunity that arises from meeting people from all over the world, right here in Cape Town. Doing good business: Make an impact beyond your bottom lineBarty pointed out that clued-in businesses are now making a conscious effort to make an impact and ease some of the world’s social ills. So it’s not just in the name of business and making your own brand the best it can be, but about having an impact beyond business. True investment in doing so means you go beyond seeing corporate social responsibility as a ‘corporate CSI box to tick’ once a year, to a real belief that by ‘doing good’, you are doing good business. Barty says that’s become a repetitive mantra of sorts but you actually see examples of this is action at YPO, which Barty found impressive.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1707/402902-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Ioulia Bolchakova © –" width="120" height="120">#CSIMonth: Going beyond armchair activismThere's been a rise in criticism for only performing acts of good on Mandela Day, but there's a similar trend of eye-rolling at the clicktivism of keyboard warriors or ‘slacktivists'...By Leigh Andrews 24 Jul 2017Lastly, from a media and marketing point of view, Barty spoke of the importance of brand humanity. YPO does this well as it’s literally an organisation of people – it doesn’t manufacture anything. In a sense he says that’s fascinating, that YPO exists and has collective power as a brand, with amazing characteristics and values. If it can be used properly, it’s something that can really shift the dial and make a real impact. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/486573-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cal Fussman at the CTICC ahead of his YPO talk.
