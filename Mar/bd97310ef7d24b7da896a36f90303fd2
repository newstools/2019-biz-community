We are honoured to be nominated in the Community Project category for the Smile Water Warriors Project. When the water crisis reached its most critical level in Cape Town in 2018, Smile 90.4FM Water Warriors united Capetonians like none other campaign had ever done. The Water Warriors was more than a campaign, it was a movement that galvanised Capetonians not only to save the most precious commodity – water – but also created a mindset shift in our behaviour! Thousands of people joined the public group on Facebook, taking the pledge to make every drop count.  “As one of the youngest stations playing in the commercial space, I am delighted that we are able to take an active role and get acknowledgement for our efforts through achieving two nominations. The Smile 90.4fm family worked tirelessly and were 150% committed to making a difference to the water crisis through our Water Warriors Campaign. To receive this acknowledgement means a great deal to us all.” – Smile 90.4FM Managing Director, Lois O’BrienThe Honest Truth with Benito Vergotine and Christine Wessels, received a second nomination in as many years nominated in the News and Actuality Show category.
