The new journey with Time Anchor’s finest gin and Decimal Agency will kick-start on 1 March 2019, as the agency will handle all the digital communication of Mirari Gin, from the all new website development to the handling of all Mirari’s social media communications. “We’ve been handling our digital comms ourselves up until now. Previously, we could handle it together with the running of the business. But like all good things, we are growing and the demand for our product has increased drastically, which leaves us with less capacity to manage our comms. This is first time that we will entrust an agency with our social and digital work, but we believe that our account is in good hands, as it’s clear that the Decimal Agency team believes in and loves the brand as much as we do – it’s the perfect pairing”, said Shanna-Rae. Time Anchor is the first craft distillery in Joburg, and is proudly fully female operated. The distillery prides itself on the crafted artistry of their meticulous alcohol-creation process, performing each step (from distilling to packaging) by hand. The artisanal Mirari range, which includes a pink damask rose, a blue orient colour-changing gin and an amber African botanicals gin, offers gin enthusiasts the signature Mirari element of mystique, with its enticing infusions of exotic botanicals. “We are well on our way to building a global advertising agency, and with clients like Mirari Gin coming on board and trusting us with their brand, makes every step of this journey absolutely worth it”, said Mc Creadie. “This comes just weeks after we have incubated a public relations offering through our sister agency, Motions PR, which will also be handling the publicity around the campaigns we have lined up for the Mirari brand”, concludes Mc Creadie.
