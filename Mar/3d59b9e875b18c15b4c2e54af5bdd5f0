Gagasi FMâ€™s Indaba is nominated for the Night Time Show category, The Kings Drive for the Afternoon Drive Show category, The Block Party hosted by Zisto and Njinga is nominated for the Music Show category and lastly DJ Naves has been nominated in the Afternoon Drive Show Presenter category. Gagasi FM is clearly still making its presence felt within the Liberty Radio Awards as they did in 2018 with five nominations that saw Mfundo Mabaso taking home the Content Producer award for Indaba. Gagasi FM has been on a winning streak recently as the station moved into its new offices at Cornubia Mall in Mount Edgecombe in 2018. Then they launched their new Gagasi FM logo and recently the station celebrated its crown birthday on 13 March 2019 where they turned 13 years old and gave away a car to a lucky listener. Now they have bagged four nominations in the 2019 Liberty Radio Awards. Gagasi is certainly on a trajectory that is seeking to continue churning out talent that has a wider relevance for a growing and upwardly mobile target audience.
