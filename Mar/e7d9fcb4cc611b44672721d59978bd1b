702 has always stood for open debate and the contestation of ideas. We fiercely guard and protect our presenters’ and callers’ right to freedom of expression as protected in the Constitution and as a signatory to the Broadcasting Complaints Commission of South Africa’s (BCCSA) code of Conduct. It is something that we, as 702, will defend. The spate of recent attacks on media professionals is not only detestable, it also places undue pressure on those working in the media. In the highly charged environment ahead of the forth coming elections, these threats are being viewed in a serious light as well as being regarded as inflammatory and as a threat to Karima’s safety.  COO of Primedia Broadcasting, Karl Gostner said, “We appeal for the threats against Karima to stop. It inhibits her and other journalists from doing their work. Attacks of this nature, are a threat to our democratic space.”For context on the above statement please see the statement issued by Sanef.
