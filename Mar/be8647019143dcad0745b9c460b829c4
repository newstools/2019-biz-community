We are proud to have played a role in the development of one of the leading financial services brands on the continent, but we believe it is time to start a new chapter. The timing is right from our perspective, to turn over a new page in our growth story, which focuses on delivering a 21st-century integrated offering to existing and potential clients,” Karabo Denalane, CEO TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris, says. “The strong relationship with Standard Bank gave us the ability to produce some iconic work over the years, and we’re humbled by many of the achievements that we’ve helped Standard Bank to realise; not least last year’s Most Valuable South African Brand award,” says Denalane. TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris will remain fully committed to Standard Bank until such time as a new agency is appointed and a successful transition is fully concluded.
