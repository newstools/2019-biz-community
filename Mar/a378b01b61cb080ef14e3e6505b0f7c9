Ogilvy Social.Lab recently opened in South Africa and now has a presence in 15 locations across four continents. The South African team led by Christophe Chantraine and composed of 18 digital media experts is active both in Johannesburg and Cape Town. Social.Lab aims to unlock the full potential of social media by developing integrated dynamic content strategies that make brands, sales and customer value grow. Our conviction is that social has a transformative power for business when you combine creative content, and sophisticated distribution with seamless measurement solutions. Social.Lab EMEA CEO Rob Hill welcomed the news of the global recognition for Social.Lab. “To be acknowledged as leading in effectiveness is really important for us as an agency,” he said. “For us, effectiveness is the most important currency in the modern marketing world. We are particularly delighted about this recognition, as it underlines our belief that Social can be transformative for business and can drive real business results.” The WARC awards programme aims to search for next-generation marketing effectiveness. The awards go to agencies who are developing and mastering new techniques to deliver business results for clients. Rob Hill said it endorsed the Social.Lab faith in the importance of return on investment (ROI) for clients. “In these times of marketing transformation, ROI has never been more in focus,” he said. “As an agency, we are striving to ensure that our work is both creatively impactful and always delivers effectiveness.”
