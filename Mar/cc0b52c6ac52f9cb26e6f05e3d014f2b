This retail space is the first of its kind focusing on the customer experience. Sandown Motors is very excited about this partnership because they believe in the exciting ethos and culture of Hot 91.9FM. Both parties look forward to bringing the elements of fun on the radio and fun on the road together to create innovative and interactive campaigns for both brands to leverage off. CEO of Sandown Motors, Roy McAllister, said, “We are delighted to enter into this partnership with Hot 91.9FM and Mansfield in the Morning. We see it as being mutually beneficial and the association between the brands can only bear fruit especially as we are being represented in the market that Hot 91.9FM has its footprint.” Host Jeremy Mansfield enthused, “It is really great to have a premium brand like Sandown Motors on board with Hot 91.9FM. There are things we believe that we can bring to their brand, and they can bring to ours, and that’s where the synergy comes in. It’s really all about experience, whether it’s fun on the radio or fun on the road and we want to link the two elements through a whole load of campaigns.” Alex Boavida added, “I think this is a great partnership. These individuals are icons. I grew up listening to Jeremy, Sam and John so it’s nice to have this relationship. I think it will be a great collaboration between ourselves, the Mercedes brand and the Sandown Dealership in Sandton.” Hot 91.9FM Managing Director, Lloyd Madurai, concluded, “We are so pleased to be a part of this great relationship and partnership. We’re also grateful to the Sandown motors team for making this happen and for being a contributor to Hot 91.9FM and Hot Cares for the past three years.”
