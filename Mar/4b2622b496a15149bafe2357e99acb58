Activate the skills of employeesThe statistics speak for themselves in that most organisations have enough content to share to prospective clients and staff, but they don’t have the means to dominate communication channels due to the nature of these being pay-as-you-go or paying media owners. Once payments stop so does the exposure.It makes sense to consider activating the skills of employees to become more digitally visible, to tap into this valuable communication channel, which is in fact not a pay-as-you-go channel but rather continuous exposure through engagement and re-sharing, therefore delivering exceptional ROI.Being a completely new form of marketing in South Africa, readily-available statistics are not available, but international statistics are completely relatable. The good news is that most employees are already on social media, so why not tap into that resource? At the heart of social is the coming together of like-minded people and communities. In fact, 98% of employees are using social media for personal use, while 50% of those already posted about their employers/organisation.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1609/360951-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Employees: credible spokespeople and sources, how to leverage this trust" width="120" height="120">Employees: credible spokespeople and sources, how to leverage this trustConsumers are losing faith in information that brands publish online and on social media as they become increasingly savvy about the myriad of tactics used by marketer to reach them.

An increase of 12% in brand advocacy can lead to 200% more revenue reveals another study. The reason it works is because people trust content and recommendations from people they know more than marketing messages from companies. In fact, people are 16 times more likely to read a post from a friend about a brand than from the brand itself. Employees are often the best salespeople of a brand (even if they’re not in sales). They have more influence over the products and services their friends and family buy than any piece of marketing material ever could.Can you afford not to investigate?
