<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/487907-625x407.jpg" alt="Scan Display's new, improved fabric lightbox" width="625" height="407">“Our lightboxes are one of our bestsellers,” says Justin Hawes, MD of exhibition, events and display specialist, Scan Display. “We have recently made some product modifications to the frame and the fabric which have given our lightbox some unique advantages.” Having undergone an upgrade, the latest version of Scan Display’s lightbox is even more effective. The biggest advantage of the new model is its ultra slim 50mm aluminium frames – a reduction on the previous 65mm frames. This makes it easier to fit the lightbox seamlessly against shop fitting surfaces and walls, and in other tight spaces. Other features of the updated lightbox include:  Newly innovated block-out fabric from Germany. This ensures the LED lightbulbs are not visible through the fabric, no matter the angle from which you look at it.  Advanced LED lighting colour-options of either pure white, warm white, or an attractive combination of the two.  Adjustable light placement to create different effects. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/487908-625x276.jpg" alt="Scan Display's new, improved fabric lightbox" width="625" height="276">“These improvements give our clients greater flexibility in terms of how and where they can use our lightboxes,” says Hawes. “They also reduce our cost of manufacture, which has resulted in the new model being sold at a lower price.” However, some things remain unchanged. A heat sink in the back panel and flame retardant textiles guarantee all of Scan Display’s lightboxes adhere to required safety standards.
