In many cases, both in advertising and in political campaigning, the consumers (voters) are captivated by the illusions and ask few questions.As we head into election season, it has been interesting to see the ante being upped by politicians. One of the most noticeable aspects of this year’s campaign has been the quality of some of the creative ideas behind it.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/488941.jpg" alt="Screen grab from the ANC campaign." width="380" height="194">Screen grab from the ANC campaign.Social media produced a clever piece of Twitter electioneering done by the ANC this week. Although it went out under the Twitter handle of President Cyril Ramaphosa, it was almost certainly the work of the party’s social media strategists.Ramaphosa’s tweets initially looked like they had been hacked (and a number of followers expressed this concern), because they had been “censored”. As they rolled on, though, more and more of the message became clear.The full post was a quote from singer Miriam Makeba, which was censored in stages. Ramaphosa then went on to explain:Miriam Makeba had her freedom of movement denied by the apartheid state. Today, we have the freedom to go where we want in our beautiful country. That is why I am voting ANC on the 8th of May.”The campaign ran on Thursday, Human Rights Day, and made the point that the country is not at all what it was under apartheid. It was a reminder of how we have changed and how far we have come. And it was an exhortation to the party faithful to trust the ANC – not an easy sell these days – to continue the good work.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/488850-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Why science matters so much in the era of fake news and fallacies" width="120" height="120">Why science matters so much in the era of fake news and fallaciesDemocracy and social progress die without science and fact-based knowledge.

Whether that is the reality or not, it is irrelevant to the message the party wants to convey.That message is clear and it is good – so an Orchid.The much-maligned and often fractious DA gets a lot of stick from a lot of people for a lot of things. But its slick TV advertising is among the best out there.The latest ad is full of the party’s rainbow nation optimism and, even to a political and marketing cynic like me, it speaks to the place SA should be, or could be… but has never become.It gets across its message clearly that the DA is the party to make these dreams of unity come true.So it gets an Orchid.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/488949.jpg" alt="Screen grabs from the DA ad." width="625" height="186">Screen grabs from the DA ad.Rule number one in the public relations business: do not send shotgun press releases to journalists. The majority of them get spiked – and why not? Who likes to be the sloppy second, or third?I got one of these this week, addressed to “undisclosed recipients” – the sign of a scatter-gun mailing process. Not only was it addressed to goodness knows how many other hacks, it had the temerity to pitch for an interview on “your breakfast show”. The only breakfast show I have is when I devour the delicious omelettes my wife makes.It came from one Patricia “Trish” Dlamini, an “associate brand architect” at DNA Brand Architects. It was on behalf of Volvo and pitching an interview with some high-up about safety. Now, had I been approached in a one-to-one manner, I might have been interested.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1803/431737-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The evolution of the public relations practitioner" width="120" height="120">The evolution of the public relations practitionerToday the PR practitioner must be responsive and well versed in many areas, mainly: marketing, social media and influencer management, while remaining tuned into the latest trends likely to affect the industry...By Maiyo Febi 2 Mar 2018To ‘shotgun’ me, makes me feel used and abused. Clearly, even though DNA Brand Architects boasts about its skill in PR (and I would firstly doubt anyone who throws about the meaningless word “awesome” with as much abandon as DNA does on its website), it doesn’t have a clue about the basics.An awesome Onion for DNA Brand Architects… and one to Volvo for good measure, for allowing this to happen.It was interesting to contrast that approach with that of Nissan SA’s PR communication team and its advisers.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/476548.jpg" alt="#BizTrends2019: Connected mobility will redefine personal transportation" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: Connected mobility will redefine personal transportationI've been in the automotive industry throughout my career, yet I'm always amazed at the technological progress we've made over the years in developing cars...By Mike Whitfield 7 Jan 2019It was all on a one-to-one basis, understanding my interests and those of my newspaper and setting up opportunities for a win-win relationship.
