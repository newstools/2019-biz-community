Where do you live, work and play? I live in Vredehoek, Cape Town; I work across the country, and I play in my flat. 2. What’s your claim to fame? I don't know if I can claim it yet, but probably winning a Savanna Comics Choice Awards and being selected by Trevor Noah to be part of his Nationwild showcase.

Tell us a few of your favourite things. Sharpening my kitchen knives, cooking soup and pasta, binging The Office (US), dreaming about all my weird ideas that I'll (one day) try, Macy Gray's voice, pancakes. 5. What do you love about your industry? It's unpredictable and forces you to be on your toes and constantly adapt. If you're not fresh, you don't survive, and that makes for good motivation.6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. I wake up at 4:45am and eat two bananas. By 5:30am, I'm at work getting ready for breakfast radio, which runs till 9am. Then I prepare for the next day's show and head home at 1:30pm, where I take a nap or I go to the gym, or take care of anything that needs to happen in my life.

I get to bed at about 11pm and the cycle starts again. 7. What are the tools of your trade? Books, news, studios, cables, microphones, and an open mind.8. Who is getting it right in your industry? The South African comedy industry is doing great things and the world is starting to notice. At the moment I'd say Conrad Koch, Loyiso Gola, Loyiso Madinga, Tumi Morake, Carvin Goldstone, and Riaad Moosa come to mind. I also can't leave the question blank without mentioning producer/director/comedy enthusiast Ryan Harduth.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/486652-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Podcaster Manoush Zomorodi was one of the YPO Edge 2019 speakers.

I spoke to Bored and Brilliant author and podcaster Manoush Zomorodi about the popularity of media with a personal touch...By Leigh Andrews 12 Mar 2019When it comes to radio, I'm a big fan of broadcasters who move towards podcasting. It’s part of the future and it's great to see so many of them popping up.9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. I definitely think that comedy can improve by working towards making it more sustainable for performers. It's a difficult industry to get into and even more difficult to stay in the industry to a point that you make it a reliable livelihood. I think radio can improve with more reliable and trustworthy methods of measuring audience numbers. At the moment, there are different ways of collecting the numbers and different opinions on what the most effective ones are.10. What are you working on right now? I'm working on doing my one-man show, The Phil Spectrum, which is happening at the Baxter Theatre on Friday, 22 March. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1805/439654-120x120.png?2" alt="Q&amp;A with comedian Phil de Lange" width="120" height="120">Q&A with comedian Phil de LangePhil de Lange, a comedian and an all round nice guy continues his rapid rise up the comedy ranks with an upcoming one-man show, The Phil Spectrum, at the Mash Turn in Woodstock, Cape Town on 10 May 2018.By Martin Myers 8 May 2018It's a show that mixes radio sketches, stand-up and music. I'm also starting a web series – I've always wanted to do a cooking show. In addition to this, I am also the Breakfast show producer on Smile 90.4FM. 11. Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. "Killing it," and "dying" - two phrases that won't make sense to someone who won't know it means to do well or do badly.12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? Mostly, when I make myself believe that I won't forget it if I don't write it down.

Are you a technophobe or a technophile? I don't know why anyone would be scared of technology. It's fantastic.15. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? A lot of memes and GIFs that I have on standby, all the time.16. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry? Know your value and prove that you're worth that much.
