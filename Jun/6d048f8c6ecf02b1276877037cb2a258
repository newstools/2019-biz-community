To redefine the brand’s conversation the concept includes women who add their voice and share their stories, bringing relevant and much-needed dialogue to the fore.Approaching the creative execution in an honest and unique way, the concept did not prescribe script lines to the narrators but rather let them authentically share their stories, as they should. Using an intimate production crew, the team brought to life in typical Converse flair – rebellious and edgy narratives aimed at showcasing the women as they push boundaries, challenging stereotypes and perceptions through their work, passion and lives.The latest stories feature Stacey-Lee May, a young motorsport enthusiast who is taking the car-spinning world by storm. Karabo Poppy, an award-winning illustrator, digital designer and street artist whose work is critically acclaimed locally and internationally. Zulaikha Patel, a young activist who is passionate about women’s rights and Robyn Brophy, a talented performer and choreographer who has been at the forefront of the women’s evolution in the world of dance.“As a brand, we acknowledge the power in storytelling and the history that our brand has played in South African people’s lives. We partnered with the very capable and talented crew at Joe Public who helped us pull this all together creating this platform where we were able to share truthful narratives about what makes South Africans truly unique under the banner of our campaign, All the Stories Are True,” says Bradley Knowles, Group Marketing Executive, Skye Distribution.The film is packaged as a fast-paced 60” which is flighting in cinema with a 45” cut-down for TV, while shorter versions that focused on the women’s individual stories and journeys live online.This year’s real-life ‘All The Stories Are True’ aim to uplift and inspire women throughout South Africa so they too can share the extraordinary things they do and challenge the norm.“As creative partners at Joe Public we have a responsibility to grow our clients’ brands, but more importantly, we need to make sure that we deliver on a creative product that is relevant, important and critical to our country at large. These films and narratives aim to go beyond advertising as they shape perceptions and our world at large,” said Xolisa Dyeshana, Chief Creative Officer, Joe Public United.Credits Brand: Converse SAClient: Bradley Knowles, Lee-Anne MckenzieAgency: Joe Public UnitedGroup Chief Creative Officer: Pepe MaraisManaging Director: Khuthala Gala-HoltenChief Creative Officer: Xolisa DyeshanaCreative Director: Claudi Potter Art Director: Mphela Mamabolo and Katlego BaaitseCopywriter: Galaletsang KgoatheStrategy: Katlego DitlhokweAccount Management: Andrew Wright and Koketso KganyagoAgency TV Producer: Vanessa BorthwickProduction Company: DolphDirector: Katlego BaaitseDirector of Photography: Diego OlivierExecutive Producer: Chad GoddardLead Actresses: Karabo Poppy, Stacey Lee May, Zulaikha Patel and Robyn Brophy.
