We have evolved from primarily a service business, into a tech company, enabling us to better manage location data and presence at a global scale whilst protecting brand reputation at a local level.We are very excited about the prospects for this industry and after many years we are retiring the BPS Corporate Identity and launching a new identity that better reflects what we as a company now stand for and our offering going forward. Location Bank has been the brand name of our technology for some time and as we move more into technology we felt it fitting that the platform name is elevated to that of company name.  Location Bank is a highly innovative technology and our commitment is to innovate continually so you get the best from us.
