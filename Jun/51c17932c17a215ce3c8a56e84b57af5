With 41% mobile broadband growth per year, the math becomes very clear.What is your projected growth trajectory?My growth trajectory is a stretch for the business, because I believe there is much to do and there is plenty of opportunity. We have grown immensely in the last couple of years, laying a strong foundation; however, placing a single or double digit number to growth could be a modest approach to the world of digital as there are dependencies.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
