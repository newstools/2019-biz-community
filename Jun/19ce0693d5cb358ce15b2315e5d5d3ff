<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/500046.jpg" alt="Kantar announces South Africa's Top 10 Best Liked Ads for Q3 and Q4 2018" width="250" height="130">The last two quarters of 2018 see a huge South African theme emerging to engage the audience’s attention, peppered with local humour. You’ve got to love the detail in Chicken Licken’s ‘3 pieces for Durango’, where the car guard helps the horse ‘reverse’ out its bay.  Slice of life stories like Mrs Balls, who created a great soundtrack that speaks to the brand, and the appearance of the occasional celebrity (to help you cook a better dinner while watching telly and your fav ads).  Local ad agencies are enjoying the kudos in this list, with only one global agency present, Wieden + Kennedy Amsterdam who incidentally is telling a South African story anyway. Samsung’s new ad also ‘shows’ instead of ‘tells’ about its capabilities, and there are some great purposeful ads from Nike and Domestos. We note this time around that babies and pets are somewhat conspicuous by their absence! The winning ads score high on enjoyment, involvement and positive emotions, entertaining the audience and making the ads memorable and easily recalled.   Who will win 2018’s Best Liked Ads? (drum roll...) Keep your eye out for the announcement on 10 July.Congratulations to the following brands and agencies:.kInstance-Body .kInstance-SubHeading{font-size:18px;padding:0px;margin:0px} .kBodyTableT table td {padding:5px;} .kBodyTableT strong{border:none; font-size:12px;} #1 AD Q3 2018  #1 AD Q4 2018 Debonairs Pizza: Big NyanaNike: Just do it: Caster Semenya <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/500047.jpg" alt="Kantar announces South Africa's Top 10 Best Liked Ads for Q3 and Q4 2018" width="500" height="110">.kInstance-Body .kInstance-SubHeading{font-size:18px;padding:0px;margin:0px} .kBodyTableT table td {padding:5px;} .kBodyTableT strong{border:1px; font-size:12px;}RANK  AD  CREATIVE AGENCY1 Debonairs Pizza “Big Nyana” FCB Africa2 Steers “Phanda Ribster Meal” McCann 18863 Protex Bar Soap “Hands Together” VML4 Mrs Balls Chutney “Everybody Loves Mrs” FCB Joburg5 Shoprite “Hustle” 99c6 Domestos “Geneva” Mullen Lowe South Africa 7 KFC “Keep Rolling” Ogilvy Cape Town8 Smirnoff 1818 Vodka “Smirnoff Desirability: FOR THEN.
