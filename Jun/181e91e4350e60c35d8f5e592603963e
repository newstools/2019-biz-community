This collaboration will allow us to share and celebrate live comedy and with our audiences. We are delighted in this partnership and look forward to many great events together.” Lloyd Madurai, managing director.        Barry Hilton, has a delightful knack of finding the ludicrous and the humorous in daily situations to make us laugh at life. He is enormously funny and his global track record highlights a unique ability to cut through all boundaries and appeal to any nationality, race or age. Barry has performed sold-out venues across the globe, including Australia, New Zealand, UK and Ireland, Hong Kong, Singapore, Dubai, America and across Africa. His comedy career has spanned a whopping three decades and seen him fill 4,000-seat auditoriums with his solo shows. Recognised as a South African Comedy Legend, his industry peers paid tribute to Barry by presenting him with A Lifetime Achiever Award in South Africa’s Annual Comics’ Choice Awards. His genuinely funny bones, his uncanny ability to gauge a crowd, his firm stance on working clean, and his unflinching work ethic make Barry Hilton an institution that has stood the testament of time and continues to impress as he breaks new ground and makes ‘em laugh all over the world. Mpho Popps Modikoane, who was born in Soweto and grew up in Vosloorus, says when life handed him lemons he entered the So You Think You're Funny comedy talent competition in 2009. He was contagiously funny and came in second. "I met comedy giants at the time who helped shape my career from that point on," he says proudly.Tenacious Mpho has reached dizzy heights after only 10 years in the entertainment industry. But he says the dream doesn't end here. Mpho still has a list of crazy but achievable goals lined up. His hard work saw him earn a nomination in the first Annual Comics' Choice Awards as best newcomer in 2011. He went on to win the award for Best Breakthrough Act in 2012 and 2013.Conrad Koch is South Africa’s top comedy ventriloquist, and possibly the only one, and is a double International Emmy nominated comedian. His most famous puppet, Chester Missing, has won numerous awards in his own right, including being the first recipient of the Ahmed Kathrada Foundation’s Anti-Racism Award.Chester Missing has interviewed most of South Africa’s political elite and has held a number of regular radio and TV slots, and even wrote an award-winning book. Conrad’s live shows have received wide political acclaim, and are a regular feature at arts and comedy festivals, including at the prestigious Just For Laughs Comedy Festival in Montreal. The truth is, with a master’s degree in social anthropology, talking to puppets was his only career option.Stand-up comic Nik Rabinowitz grew up on a farm in Africa, climbing trees and commentating on his own rugby games in three of South Africa’s eleven official languages. He was raised on the mean, green streets of Constantia, Cape Town, a world of ride-bys, piano lessons, and unrelenting love and financial support from family members.Despite all this hardship he has still managed to be moderately successful, sporting a list of achievements the likes of which many can only aspire to. For instance, he once posed nude. Not because anyone asked him to, he just did it. Also, he represented South Africa at the Jewish Olympics, which is like the Special Olympics, with more accountants.[Little known fact: Rabinowitz is rumoured to be an extraordinarily talented cricketer. In fact, his leg-spinning prowess was so great that Pakistani bookmakers bankrolled his comedy career to keep his stunning skills out of the international arena.]From a young age, when no-one was looking, he would pretend to be his own praise-singer. For example: “Nik Rabinowitz! Makes toast like a warrior, hunts peanut butter like a lion! Breakfast foods tremble in his presence”. Later, at the Waldorf School, he learned how to grow his own veggies, express his feelings through interpretative dance, and crochet his own underpants.International appearances include Australia, Canada, Holland, the United Kingdom, the USA, and Zimbabwe. He’s been a guest on BBC 2’s Mock the Week, performed at London’s Royal Albert Hall, and intentionally driven on the wrong side of the road in Nigeria. His major claim to fame remains the fact that he was born in a stable, and is one of only two Jewish boys in the last two thousand years to have done so. Chris Forrest has been on the forefront of the South African Comedy scene since the late nineties. His unique dry sense of humour, quick wit and intelligent comedy has made him one of the country’s most popular comedians and ensured that audiences are left in stitches wherever he goes. Chris started out at the “Funny Farm”, and has since gone on to perform on every worthwhile comedy club, showcase or festival in the country including South Africa’s premier comedy show: The 46664 “It’s No Joke” comedy show as one of South Africa’s top 10 comics, he’s also a regular on The Blacks Only Show, and featured regularly on the Heavyweight Comedy Jam and the Kingsize Comedy Show. International festivals include: The Edinburgh Festival, The Lyric Theatre in London and The Round Table Comedy Show in Ghana, Director, producer, MC and comedian David Kau needs no introduction – over the past 20 years of his career as a comedian his outlook on everything South African has earned him a strong following.
