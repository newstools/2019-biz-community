Howard Audio composed the music that took the commercial to even greater heights. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/504283.jpg" alt="Howard Audio bags two Cannes Lions" width="443" height="375">"Music has the capacity to build emotion like no other element of filmmaking," says Adam Howard. "I worked closely with the creative team; in fact, we experimented with several different treatments before settling on the preferred route." Adam played the flugel horn (trumpet) for the track. "This is my primary instrument," he explains, "So to compose a piece featuring the flugel horn was very special to me. This is the third year running that Howard Audio has taken home a Cannes Lion and I'm very proud of that."
