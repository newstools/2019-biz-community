The last day at #AWE2019 didn't disappoint at all.The first session was by USA Today Network and their approach to immersive storytelling in journalism.Over the last few years, they've tackled small proof of concept campaigns in order to learn how AR can be applied in journalism.They've covered actual Space X rocket launches and showed Live AR with virtual rockets.Their best campaign to date covered the 2019 Oscars and showcased all the Costumes of the Year finalists in Oscars in AR. The experience had interviews with nominated designers and allowed users to see the costumes in 3D AR.Another interesting session was around How Sound Augments Reality. There's the traditional method of sound augmenting AR visuals - i.e giving context to the AR experience you're watching. But then there's also how sound directly augments reality.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/499172.jpg" alt="#AWE2019: Highlights from Day 1" width="120" height="120">#AWE2019: Highlights from Day 1The Augmented World Expo is underway in Silicon Valley, USA, and Johan Walters shares highlights from Day 1...By Johan Walters 30 May 2019The best example of this is the Bose AR wearables.
