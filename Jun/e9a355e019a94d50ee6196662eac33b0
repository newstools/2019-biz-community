The Whopper Detour is a fantastic piece that really changes the formats of branding, promos and consumer engagement. It’s just great when a brand plays with culture and their customers to create experiences that are just great stories for all involved. I think the Skittles Musical is also an interesting format change and experiment, but we will see if people actually like the work. I’m pretty sure 'Dream Crazy' by Nike will be well rewarded as a brand that has a point of view, not just a purpose. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/484469-120x120.jpg?2" alt="A screen grab from Nike's 'Get crazier'." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Nike 'dreams crazier' with Caster and SerenaNike's 'Dream crazier' taps into the inclusion and equality mindset, and shows that girls who want to play like boys need to dream crazier, while serving to destigmatise and reframe the world's interpretation of 'crazy'...By Leigh Andrews 4 Mar 2019In terms of gender equality, there are two great pieces from VMLY&R that I think should do really well. The 'Miss America 2.0' piece from our New York office is a fantastic initiative that really redefines what Miss America should stand for in this time. Our Polish VMLY&R office also produced a fantastic piece – they took over the longest running Polish porn magazine and shut it down, before publishing its last ever issue, which was all about equality and gender issues.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/501351-120x120.jpg?2" alt="RyanMcManus, regional chief creative officer (CCO) at VMLY&amp;R, is serving on this year’s Cannes Lions Entertainment jury." width="120" height="120">#CannesLions2019: "A holiday for ideas" - judging insights with Ryan McManusThe Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity for 2019 kicks off next week, with winners announced at nightly awards from 17 to 21 June.
