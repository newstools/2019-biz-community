We at Playfre are trying to bring the over 45 million songs on Spotify to you at no charge, with the same Spotify experience and guess what? We did it!” Nwaogu said.He explained that big music streaming platforms still charge monthly to stream unlimited music which is not fair to Nigerians, explaining why among many other reasons he embarked on creating Playfre. Nwaogu mentioned that lots of big music streaming platforms have not yet been opened to most African countries due to a lack of strength in the intellectual property laws existing in this part of the world. Playfre‘s android app is available for free download on Google Playstore. He added that Playfre will be rolling out Playfre for Artist service, a service that will let musicians get their songs on the platform for free.  Source: NexTVAfrica.com.
