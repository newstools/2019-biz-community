But when she's not behind the mic, she does that through TV commercials, engaging audiences as a master of ceremonies and event host, or she uses her performance skills as a lifestyle and talent model.

We each have a fire and passion burning inside of us, and this is mine. We go about our lives with so many filters, so I love creating and being part of spaces that get behind them. That connects with my other key passions: women empowerment, creating a better world and inspiring others. I think that's something we should aim to do in whatever industry we may find ourselves in..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}So true. What do you think the industry can improve on and how can young voices help bring this change about?I think across the board, there can always be an improvement in management decisions, especially when it comes to cultivating and nurturing the greatness of talent.I think young people should not be afraid to take up space and know that our thoughts, ideas and observations are valid. Imposter syndrome can be so real when entering an industry as a fresh new talent. Knowing that you have the potential and capability to bring about change is a key starting point. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1709/408953-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Wessels and Manyelo, this year's Loeries young creative winners." width="120" height="120">#LadiesofLoeries: “Fight for your ideas, ask for what you want” - Karmen WesselsThe Loeries have been recognising a duo of fresh creative talent under the age of 27 since 2007.

Our lives are increasingly being influenced by the digital space, online mechanisms, social media, etc. and radio needs to, and is, adapting to that. If the new voices we are hearing and those wishing to enter the industry are anything to go by, then, oh, it is so bright! I am so excited for what is to come. This keeps me motivated to do my best and work to add value to our listeners, the number one priority.    View this post on Instagram  So grateful for my journey with this medium which has allowed me to find my voice and connect with so many, in so many different ways. To laugh, to cry, to think, to answer questions, to come up with answers, to reminisce, build relationship, converse, delve into the beauty music... Man, I love this job ✊�� May we never take for granted the sheer magnitude of the opportunity we have EVERY time we put on that mic. Happy World Radio Day!A post shared by  M A M O H A U S E S E A N E (@mamohau_s) on Feb 13, 2019 at 12:30pm PST.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why do you think it’s important for brands to support and collaborate particularly with young creatives?Without labouring the saying, the reality is that the youth is the future. Young creatives are connecting so much, garner a lot of engagement, and know and understand the current landscape and target audiences. As a brand, supporting a young person is supporting the creation of something new, fresh and innovative. The world is changing; so should they. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you think is key for brands to keep in mind when marketing to the youth?My friends and I always joke that it really helps if brands pretend that they are not doing it for financial gain, but I think it's so true! Understand your audience and reach out to those who do. Brands need to speak to the right people in the right tone, and it needs to make sense, especially in terms of influencer marketing. It's the experience you offer that makes a difference and will draw people to you. The youth can smell inauthenticity from a mile away.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496436-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Is your brand telling the true story?" width="120" height="120">Is your brand telling the true story?Stories are a powerful part of the human experience.

The common factor is that they are individuals with the courage to be themselves, live in their truth, and slay the game. However, my number one must be my mother. She is a single mother who has consistently, zealously and gracefully overcome insurmountable challenges to grant me the best opportunities. If I could be even half the woman she is, I will have achieved something great. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What advice would you like to convey to all the newbies trying to crack into the industry?I already have so much that I have learned in my few radio years. The most important ones would be to have a plan and get a mentor. Invest in yourself and your career; don't wait for someone to hand you an opportunity or make your career decisions for you. When entering the space, I think it's so important never to take for granted the opportunity you have to speak to and engage with thousands of people every single time you are on-air. Use it wisely. Be creative. Be you.
