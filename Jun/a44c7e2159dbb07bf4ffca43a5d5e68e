We explored how this shift is having a positive and negative impact on business and the planet and the relevance and importance of humanity in this increasingly automated economy.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/462716-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Ads24 shares literal and figurative Food For Thought" width="120" height="120">Ads24 shares literal and figurative Food For Thought"I'm so pleased we're wearing aprons as this is so slurpy!"

The pace of technological advancement is astounding and is having a significant impact on how we do business and who does what in business. There are so many areas in which the media industry is changing, from the way in which people are consuming news to social media, fake news, hyper-personalisation and programmatic buying, if we don’t keep pace and remain agile to these changes, we face professional extinction. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}In summary, what ‘food for thought’ do you hope delegates took away? The point behind Food for Thought is to get people thinking and debating so that the decision makers in positions of leadership can come up with new concepts and solutions to the challenges they face. In summary, our hope for Food for Thought is that there are as many original nuggets or takeouts as there are delegates. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What was your personal highlight?
