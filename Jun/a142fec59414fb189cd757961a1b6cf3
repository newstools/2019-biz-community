Ludus has appointed Sheron Enslin as facility manager for Ludus Johannesburg, while Thandiswa Ndaba heads up Ludus Cape Town, fully embracing gender and racial transformation. Ludus’ biggest accolade is a Level 2 Broad Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) status. This achievement marks a significant milestone in the Ludus’ transformation journey. BBBEE Level 2: Official Post Production Sponsor for Loeries 2019 A ‘Ludus’ was an ancient Roman school where gladiators were trained. Much like those schools, what comes out of Ludus Post Productions is exceptional, projects that are dedicated to smart well-executed communication. Ludus is a post-production facility known for seamlessly translating innovative ideas into audiovisual reality. The company has studios in both Johannesburg and Cape Town. Ludus has a long history of award-winning collaborations with prominent agencies, directors, producers and premium brands. Ludus Post Productions placed first as the number-one post-production facility in Africa and the Middle East by Loeries Awards 2018 and is proud to be part of Loeries 2019. The Loeries final extended deadline for entries is June 7, 2019. Details at loeries.com.
