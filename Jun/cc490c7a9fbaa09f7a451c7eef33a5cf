Image from Oovvuu Twitter.Credible brand-safe websitesThis multi-publisher partnership with Oovvuu means that agencies can now offer clients substantial exposure to credible, brand-safe websites outside of Facebook and YouTube environments.Unlike Facebook and YouTube, pre-roll ads on Oovvuu content cannot be skipped, leading to longer engagement times and an increased opportunity for meaningful brand engagement.Moreover, given the recent avalanche of disinformation campaigns on Facebook and YouTube, advertisers are exposed to a significant risk of finding digital assets on exceptionally brand un-safe content and Oovvuu solves this problem.Oovvuu CEO, Ricky Sutton, notes: “When we originally met with South African media agencies, there were three primary requirements – brand safety, engagement and cost-effective scalability.“Agencies want the ability to buy volume with one click, therefore Connect was created, allowing agencies to buy from all publishers at one time.“We’ve simply given agencies what they’ve been asking for.”
