The commercial played on a variation of ‘This Little Light of Mine,’ the Maq campaign theme. In order to reach higher LSM’s with their Auto offering, composer Adam Howard was briefed to move away from the well-known gospel melody and completely re-harmonise the song - using the same lyrics and rhythm. The commercial used the vocal stylings of Mariechan Luiters which gave the commercial the right tone and feel.The brief for the winning Maq Auto washing powder TVC featured three different characters, each of whom uses the product in their own unique way, culminating at their graduation reunion.Adam Howard was approached by Bliss Brands two years ago to work on a new musical approach for use on all Maq products: "The brief was to use the famous gospel traditional song - "This Little Light Of Mine” - make it work to a 30 sec script - and end off with a new musical mnemonic incorporating Maq’s new tagline - 'Maq - Shine On!'Bliss Brands Marketing Director Liezel Bygate adds: "This has been a great learning-curve about how just one piece of music can be tweaked and re-arranged to fit any style of brand TVC and how the mnemonic is integral. Adam has been very clever musically, making the song and mnemonic fit over so many different briefs.”Since the campaign was launched, Maq has experienced unprecedented growth and research has shown that both the song and the mnemonic have very strong associations with the brand. Maq is now the number two brand in the hand wash category.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/501172.png" alt="Creative synergies shine a light on Maq" width="400" height="191">
