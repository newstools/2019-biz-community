Speaking at a media briefing ahead of the first show, Multi-Media director Chris de Lancey explained the immensity of the investment for the company. "Multi-Media recognised a while back that we needed to upscale our audio quality. In conjunction with some very supportive partners, and because we were looking for the best solution available on the market, we set our sights on the L-ISA system by L-Acoustics."This was a huge undertaking as L-Acoustics is very selective about the companies that are offered the opportunity to operate their highest-end systems - and our audio engineers had to attend extensive training at L-Acoustics' headquarters in France to certify them to use the system," De Lancey went on to explain.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/500799-625x417.jpg" alt="Multi-Media debuts L-ISA on The Voice SA" width="625" height="417">"We, at Multi-Media, feel extremely privileged to be able to offer South African audiences the first audio experience of its kind in the country as we believe that this is the future of sound." - Chris de Lansey, Director Multi-MediaIn an interview conducted for MNET, de Lancey explained what sets the L-ISA apart form more traditional large-format sound systems. "A traditional set-up incorporates an array of speakers placed on the left and right of the stage. To achieve a stereo effect, multiple inputs such as vocals, instruments and backing tracks have to be combined into the left, and right speaker feeds. This means only a small chunk of the audience would experience true stereo sound with most hearing everything in mono depending on their seating in the space."By contrast, L-ISA can accommodate not a mere two but up to 96 channels of audio and play them out in a custom, multiple-speaker set up. This patented technology, demonstrated at ISE earlier this year, allows for sound elements to be individually placed in a 3D environment, enveloping the live audience in sound and allowing the audience to hear and see where talent are on the stage."Anslin Gysman, a finalist on van Coke's team, comments: "Keeping in mind that this is a first for South Africa and The Voice globally, it is an absolutely amazing opportunity for the Talent participating in this season of the show. We have become used to working with a range of sound systems - but L-ISA is going to provide us with a better opportunity to showcase our vocal ability and also to give the audience a more exhilarating, emotional and personal experience."On the evening of 19 May, L-ISA did not disappoint - as the quality of sound in the auditorium during the first live performance of The Voice South Africa Season 3 was a truly revolutionary experience.The Voice South Africa airs Sundays at 17:30 only on M-Net channel 101.
