As the NBC team we knew what we want and we believe this reality show will be a hit,” Similo said, adding that the show will make a lot of people realise who they are by keeping fit and eating healthily, either the participants or the viewers. Nepembe is excited to be the first Namibian to host a reality show. The show has 10 participants who were desperate to live healthy lifestyles. She encouraged them to keep on working on their bodies and stay healthy, adding that by the end of the first season they will announce the ultimate winner.Source: NexTVAfrica.com.
