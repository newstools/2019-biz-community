It is common cause that tourism is a key strategic industry in terms of National Tourism Sector Strategy documents as it supports government objectives of alleviating the triple challenges of unemployment, poverty and inequality.The scope of South African Tourism’s business includes four distinct areas of business focus and delivery, with different target markets and segments:I.	International Leisure tourism (travel trade and consumer) and Domestic leisure tourism (travel trade and consumer);II.	Business events through the delivery unit the South African National Convention Bureau (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions);III.	Quality assurance of the tourism sector/industry through the delivery of both Visitor Experience and the Tourism Grading Council of South Africa; andIV.	Corporate – enhancing the South African Tourism brand.South African Tourism recently issued a tender for the procurement of marketing and communications agency services under SAT Tender 144/19. During the tender process it however came to light that South African Tourism incorrectly articulated its pre-qualification criteria for preferential procurement to advance certain designated groups as contemplated in regulation 9(1) and 9(2) of the Preferential Procurement Regulations, 2017.South African Tourism subsequently concluded that, in order to comply with the fundamental procurement law of fairness, the tender is to be reissued setting out the universal sub-contracting regime in clear terms i.e. restating the general requirement.This tender notice therefore unequivocally cancels SAT Tender 144/19 while also serving as a new notice for the reissuing of South African Tourism’s marketing and communications agency service tender now being SAT Tender 162/19. The only material change in the new bid document is that of restating the general requirement of subcontracting as a condition of tender.The detailed scope of services and tender requirements will now be available in a comprehensive bid document (RFP - SAT 162/19) from 9am on Friday, 28 June 2019 on: https://www.southafrica.net/gl/en/corporate/page/tenders Contact details: Mrs. Pulane Muligwa, tel.
