The Mix & Match feature allows travellers to book more than one airline in the same ticket – for example, travellers can choose to fly from Cape Town to London on British Airways and return on Turkish Airlines without booking separate segments.We caught up with Faling to find out more about Travelcheck.co.za, why it was started, the challenges it's faced and what makes it different: .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}When, how and why was Travelcheck started?Travelcheck started about a month ago when we noticed a need in the market for bundled flights and hotels to be bookable online. We found that South Africans are paying more than what they should when booking holidays as no online travel agency offers the ability to package flights and hotels and custom-create trips. Booking travel in a bundle opens savings for travellers..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How does it work? What is its unique function?Travelcheck.co.za is an online travel agency. We build technology to help travellers save time and money when planning and booking trips. What sets us apart is our dynamic packages feature which lets people custom-create their trips, saving them up to 25% in the process. In addition, we offer a bunch of useful add-on services (such as travel insurance), we have a dedicated team available 24/7 for urgent queries, and our mix and match feature for domestic and international flights allow travellers to book multiple airlines in the same ticket; another money-saver!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}You recently went live – what are some of the challenges you have overcome?Every day has been a challenge but that is the nature of startups. Getting our dynamic package capabilities ready one hour before launching was probably the most challenging from a technical standpoint.

However, we have had over 50,000 visits to our website in the last 2 weeks as a result of digital campaigns we have run through social media and Google Ads.

Where would you like to see the company go in the next 5 years?Right now, our focus is on ensuring a smooth customer experience, and building and growing a volume of users. We want to get to know our customers so that we can focus on real personalisation and AI-driven solutions for travellers. Like Google does in search, Travelcheck wants to tell people where they want to go rather than them having to think about it. This understanding of one’s customers takes a while to build. In Travelcheck, we aim to build a reputable brand that helps people with great prices and takes the pain out of travel planning.The OTA has partnered with third parties to offer useful ancillaries which can be added during the online booking, including: lost luggage insurance, a cancellation and refund policy and flight ticket amendments.
