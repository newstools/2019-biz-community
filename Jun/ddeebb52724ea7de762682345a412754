This, in addition to live blogging for 85 hours, from when the voting stations opened at 7am on Wednesday 9 May to 8pm on Saturday 11 May when the official results were announced.Prior to the elections, Netwerk24 ran a podcast series featuring interviews with leaders and heavyweights from the major political parties to create truly holistic coverage that allowed all South Africans in-depth insights to make informed voting decisions.
