People no longer want to be spoken to; they want to be spoken with. They want to feel like the exchange of information is a co-creation, not a directive. So, as a social media ideator (aka creator), you have your work cut out for you. In the saturated ocean of social media, there are certain questions you will need to ask of yourself and your brand; what skills do you need to thrive, to stand out, and to deliver content which is considered of a higher quality? And how can you make a greater impact on those consuming your content? These are the five skills that are used to cultivate and better connect to a social media audience. Be a flexible strategistMany business and marketing strategies are static; companies keep the same strategy for years without amending it. But social media changes at a rapid rate, algorithms change, socio-economic and political events drastically affect social topics and viewpoints. You need to be fluid in your strategy; expect that it will need to be amended often to suit the consumer’s taste.Be analyticalSocial media is about staying on top of the latest trends, with what consumers are interested in, as well as taking an objective look at the insights coming from the date. You will need to consider even the smaller details of what will make your social media goals successful, as well as look at the bigger piece of the social media pie and how you can add value in the greater scheme of things. Be proactiveAt work, our social media ideators, need to constantly conceptualise ways to remain top of mind and create the greatest impact. But with so much content and strategy being created for social media, creativity alone is not enough. Be proactive, launch the idea first, create the first post of its kind and take bold action.Community managementBeing able to create a space where you can connect with your followers, understand them and support their needs, is very important. As in real life, community management means listening to what consumers have to say, and then cultivating and nurturing those relationships with intention and diligence.Be decisiveYour values, vision and direction need to be clear so that you can attract the right people to your platform. You’re allowed to amend strategies and change your mind, but being decisive is important because if you stand for something, people will stand with you. Lastly, as a bonus nugget: Be adaptive. Social media is an ever-changing landscape with a diverse multitude of people. You need to be nimble with your fingers and often adapt and make immediate changes to what you had planned in order to remain relevant and keep thriving!
