To limit piracy and maximise the artists’ revenue, the music downloaded from Awtar will not be shareable.The creators of the app have also established a structure to guarantee that all creatives included in the split sheet for the song – such as singers, lyricists, music arrangers, melodists and producers – receive a 20% share of the profit from the song.Awtar will also be used as a platform for sharing music-related news, concerts and workshops.
