They were extremely impressed by the work achieved by the Bank, particularly in terms of regional integration,” said African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina, at the closing press conference of the Meetings. “Our AAA rating is preserved and protected… Look at our income. It’s sky-high.” The theme for the Malabo Meetings was, Regional Integration for Africa’s Economic Prosperity. Cesar Mba Abogo, the country’s Minister of Finance, said the Annual Meetings had allowed its country to showcase its opportunities. “This has been a great moment for us. It fits in with our development plan and our investment needs. This is a country that is open for business and open to everyone. We are extremely happy to showcase what we have to the world,” he said. During the Meetings, the Board of Governors discussed the Bank’s performance, outlook and a proposed General Capital Increase (GCI). Adesina welcomed the “solid support” from the Bank’s shareholders, who gave the go-ahead for further discussions around a GCI.Responding to a question on the Bank’s support to fragile nations, Adesina said: “Every dollar that the Bank spent in GCI led to $17 of benefit to low-income countries. So the GCI not just for rich countries, it lifts everybody up.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/502037-120x120.jpg" alt="African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina." width="120" height="120">'To integrate Africa, bring down the walls'"To integrate Africa, bring down the walls," African Development Bank President Akinwumi Adesina urged at the 2019 AfDB Annual Meetings Open in Malabo...22 hours ago Adesina said the Bank’s transition facility continued to assist countries emerging from conflict, while its investments played a strategic role in helping countries that find themselves in the “triangle of disaster” – unemployment, poverty and environmental degradation.
