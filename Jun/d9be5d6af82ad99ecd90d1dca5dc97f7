The foundation has successfully helped create marine protected areas in over two million square kilometres of ocean, and has ongoing campaigns to fully protect even more threatened waters. The app incorporates JET8’s fintech technology to reward users for in-app engagement through JETPoints - a social currency with which users can make contributions to the The Lewis Pugh Foundation."We only protect what we love," says Pugh. "Which is why I urge everyone to get into the ocean and be reminded of the beauty and fragility of this vital life source. And why I’m thrilled to announce a new way for you to share your passion for ocean protection: OceansCam lets you share your latest photos to encourage your friends to support ocean protection. So next time you pick up a piece of plastic on a beach, find an alternative for single-use plastic or have a memorable ocean encounter, share it on OceansCam and spread the love!” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/501718.jpg" alt="New social commerce app launched focusing on saving the oceans" width="625" height="257">Connecting people with charitiesVictor Zabrockis, JET8 Foundation director, says: “We are very proud to support this initiative.
