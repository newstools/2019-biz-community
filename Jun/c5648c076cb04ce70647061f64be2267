We’ve been focused on diversification for the past several years and this division is a natural extension to our diversification strategy.”Moffatt continues: “We are marrying the power of creativity and ideas with business strategy, to provide our clients with disruptive means to position themselves in the market, as well as define how they deliver their products and services. Our clients are experiencing uniquely creative business solutions that are not a cut and paste from the traditional management consulting playbook. We are becoming trusted advisors solving multiple client challenges, not just those within the marketing communications landscape.”The agency anticipates strong growth from its consulting division in the coming year.
