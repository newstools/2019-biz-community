Through this cooperative approach we have accomplished so much more than we ever dreamed possible – the adage two heads are better than one has certainly held true in this instance.  It felt like a natural progression to formalise the relationship.” Clients looking for an innovative, data-driven, creative marketing mix are now able to access class-leading expertise in the form of ATKASA and Initiative – ultimately delivering a through-the-line offering, ensuring all clients’ business’ dovetails to guarantee single-minded, cohesive messaging. Adds Liz Beare, Managing Director of Initiative, “We’re in the business of creating, building and growing the brands in our care.  Many of our clients required the digital expertise that ATKASA were renowned for.  Having worked as a team for many months and having seen the results delivered to our respective clients, we felt very comfortable that this was a win-win situation for both agencies.” The new partnership will become effective from 28 May 2019 with both agencies retaining their individual brand names and identities.
