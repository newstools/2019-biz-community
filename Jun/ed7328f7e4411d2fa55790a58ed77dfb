As digital ad spend increases, so does Out of Homes’, because it drives people in the real world online.”Outdoor Network is leveraging these DOOH benefits and it’s large format network complements the group’s growing roadside rotating digital billboard presence. As a result, Outdoor Network is able to offer a wide range of large and small format billboards nationally, in high reach and frequency locations, and deliver diverse consumer segments and audiences, at a competitive cost-per-thousand (CPT).Look out for more state-of-the-art signature highway digital billboards across South Africa, as Outdoor Network continues its aggressive growth strategy.1. https://specialreports.oaaa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Nielsen_042417.pdf
