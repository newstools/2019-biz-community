He was always well dressed, well spoken, had a great sense of humour. He was really a great, humble guy," said Hammond."He was one of a kind, very selfless, you could literally call him any time of the day," said fellow photographer Elmond Jiyane, who was mentored by Mabuza.After leaving journalism in 2015, Mabuza became an emerging cattle farmer.Update:Sanef has issued a joint press release in which it also acknowledges the passing of veteran journalist, ZB Molefe in addition to the news of Mabuza having passed away.

Mabuza will be remembered as one of the photojournalists who covered Chris Hani's assassination. “Mabuza was an outstanding photographer, who was promoted to the position of managing editor at the Sunday Times and later to the same position at the Sowetan and Sunday World. He retired in 2015. It is indeed sad news to hear about his passing,” said Moipone Malefane, Sanef’s secretary general.The release also mentioned former City Press journalist, Zuluboy Molefe, popularly known as ZB Molefe, who passed away this past weekend.
