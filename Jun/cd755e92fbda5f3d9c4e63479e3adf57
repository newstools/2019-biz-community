She leveraged technology and her networking skills to kick-start her own business, Blaqpage Creative Communications in 2013. She was voted Young Direct Marketer of the Year in 2018 at the Assegai Awards and if that’s not enough she is also an internationally published poet with an incredible NGO under belt, PS Parenting Solo.When asked about how she feels about the evolution of the industry and the changing roles of women in advertising, Bongi expressed, “The women have been getting a seat at the table for a while now, the challenge is whether they are in positions to actually affect the change they would like to see in the industry. I am not just happy with being called a creative director if that does not translate to getting involved and adding my award-winning expertise perspective to the brands I work with. The industry as a whole has some way to go in this regard. I joined The Hardy Boys because I rate them as one of the more progressive agencies. I am geared and looking forward to creating a space where it is normal to have black female creative directors.”About The Hardy Boys:The Hardy Boys is an incurably curious group of idea generators, strategic thinkers and passionate problem solvers who, since 1994, have been helping brands find their voice.Some fast facts about The Hardy Boys: THB Verve, a division of The Hardy Boys (THB), is a leading and award-winning Public Relations Agency with experience and expertise in Stakeholder Management, Influencer Management and Media Relations.
