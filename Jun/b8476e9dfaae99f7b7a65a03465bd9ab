Yes – I’ve actually judged at Clios, New York Festivals’ Advertising Awards, Cannes Young Directors, as well as Loeries. I even once judged at AdPrint in Romania, which was especially cool because I got to see Dracula’s castle..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Impressive! What does that add to your judging ability? More than anything, it gives me perspective. You’re looking at so much work, the previous experiences help me know what to look for and what to expect. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/456197.png" alt="Cannes Lions case studies or how not to make rubbish advertising" width="120" height="120">Cannes Lions case studies or how not to make rubbish advertisingCinemark, the official South African Cannes Lions representatives, in partnership with Bizcommunity, hosted the annual Insights and Trends from Cannes Lions sessions, which took place in Johannesburg on Wednesday, 29 August, and in Cape Town on Friday, 31 August...By Terry Levin, Issued by Bizcommunity.com 4 Sep 2018It’s important to not focus on the environment, but rather the work and to soak up different people’s points of view.

It was so local, so African and so different compared to the other work you would see at the festival and it felt really meaningful to do something truly African on that stage.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497807-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#CannesLions2017: Establishing Africa as a front-runner in the creative industry" width="120" height="120">#CannesLions2017: Establishing Africa as a front-runner in the creative industryFrom the moment you step onto the Promenade de la Croisette in the city of Cannes, where creatives from up to 100 different countries all gather for the largest international showcase of cinematic art, there is a sense of community, we are all connected.By Mikhaila Hunter 23 Jun 2017Over and above all the amazing work, the highlights for me are the people and the connections you make; all the conversations you get to have, whether it’s over lunch or in jury rooms or late, late at night. They are always very interesting and leave me inspired..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Which category(s) of work are you judging this year? I’m judging Entertainment this year, one of the most exciting new categories. It’s basically the convergence of all the stuff we like to do and all the things consumers like to spend time with. Also, because the category is relatively new, the work that wins helps define the category and the direction that branded content is moving.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1707/401923-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cheers!

Their talent and their views are obviously very important, but I think more than anything, local judges can provide local nuance and context to understanding the work South Africa has entered. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495901-120x120.jpg?3" alt="7 SA creatives selected to judge Cannes Lions 2019" width="120" height="120">7 SA creatives selected to judge Cannes Lions 2019Seven South African creatives have been selected as judges for this year's Cannes Lions...9 May 2019As a country, South Africa is very difficult to sum up in the first ten seconds of a case film. Having SA judges in the room gets our work a better chance of being understood and awarded. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Give us a glimpse of the specific criteria you’ll be looking for in judging this year's entries. With Entertainment as a category, it’s really hard to define parameters, such as how long should it be, how does it fit in – but that’s the rational side.The more emotional question is: Is it entertaining? Do I want to keep watching it and how original is the story-telling, how does it relate back to the brand values and how relevant is it to the audience?For me, this is a very meaningful category and awards must go to work that the audience chooses to spend time with. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}With other international award shows D&AD and the One Show having wrapped up for the year, any predictions of creative trends that are likely to stand out at Cannes Lions 2019? I think we are seeing more and more of how brands are having a point of view, not just a purpose, especially around gender equality and inclusivity, which is great. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/487488-120x120.jpg?2" alt="As seen in the Kantar AdReaction Getting Gender Right webinar." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Get gender right in advertising by sidestepping stereotypesThe Kantar insight division's Duncan Southgate, global brand director of media and Jane Ostler, global head of media, recently presented a global webinar session in headline findings from their latest AdReaction study on the challenges of gender-progressive marketing and getting gender right in advertising. Here's what you missed...By Leigh Andrews 18 Mar 2019We’re also seeing how completely new formats are being woven into the brand experience. There are some great new tech ideas coming through, too. All the great pieces really seem to express the values of the brand by living them, instead of just telling you about it..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Love that. What are you most looking forward to from the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity 2019? For me, it’s always the people and the work. It’s really very rare to have time to disconnect, watch some of the best work in the world and chat to the most creative people in the world. It often takes weeks to digest, but it’s like a holiday for ideas. While main judging only takes place in Cannes next week, watch for the SA judges’ specific predictions of the work that will win, later this week! The Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity runs from 17 to 21 June 2019, with Cinemark – now known as Ster-Kinekor Sales – the local representatives of Cannes Lions for SA.
