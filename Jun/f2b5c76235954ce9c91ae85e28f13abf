Hecho Studios gathered photographer André Bakker and body paint artist Ton Nizet to create striking images that shed light on the status quo of creative awards and Epica’s uniqueness."We appreciate the aesthetic and unique perspective Epica brings to judging creative work. To elevate this we wanted to convey a bold and visually striking message inspired on op art. With André and Ton in the mix, we managed to create an eye-catching visual that illustrates self-affirmation with a dash of sex-appeal”, says Gregg Clampffer, executive creative director at Hecho Studios Amsterdam. Returning to AmsterdamEpica Awards will return to Amsterdam for its next jury meeting, conference and ceremony from November 18 to 21. The ceremony will be held for the second time at the spectacular KIT Royal Tropical Institute. It will be preceded by the annual Creative Circle conference, whose subject this year is “The Truth About Brand Purpose.”This year’s jury president is Fiona Rogers, chief operating officer of Magnum Photos. For 70 years Magnum has been home to legendary photojournalists, many of whom have also worked in the advertising field.New websitePlus, Epica revealed its brand new website, designed by Lithuanian studio and former Epica winners Godspeed Branding.Tomas Ramanauskas, co-founder of Godspeed Branding: "We decided to go epic for Epica. First, we’ve focused on brand assets: a striking award - a glass pyramid. It became the focal point of the website, a spinning object of fetish. Then we’ve taken Epica’s main brand colour and made it rule their web look - all of it turning black."Dovydas Stonkus, head of design, Godspeed Branding: “We’ve worked really hard on the practical things: a refreshed UX, fewer pages, responsive design, quicker access of information. Our design team used animation to make browsing a smooth, seamless experience. The creative process was exceptionally smooth since we knew the Epica Awards very well and had a clear vision of how we would like to make them look. Great communication with the Epica team helped tremendously."
