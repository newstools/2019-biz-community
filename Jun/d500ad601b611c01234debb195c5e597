My thanks to both Yusuf and Iman for the hard work they both put into compelling programming.” eNCA can also confirm that it is revaluating its weekday and weekend line-up. This is carried out on a regular basis with the intention of improving programming and growing the audience of the country’s most watched news channel. Maggs says when changes are made, eNCA will communicate those changes.
