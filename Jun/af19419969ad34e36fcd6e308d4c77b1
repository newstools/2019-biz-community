Thus, NTWRK Area3 was created. A local creative platform that champions content creation and storytelling based on Instagram. Housed on the social media platform, young creatives are given product and budget from Adidas Originals to bring their creative vision to life. Especially since one of the major barriers for young creators in South Africa is access to product, and the funding needed to execute high-quality content.    View this post on InstagramNTWRK AREA3 will continue to elevate the voices of young creators and thrust their ideas to the masses. By empowering them with confidence, backing and an engaging platform, we allow their self-expression to influence others.

Once a creator has been identified, the brand then looks to align them with a product story that feels authentic to their aesthetic. The creator is then introduced to the NTWRK Area3 concept and platform and confirmation of interest is secured. A brief is shared by the brand detailing the product the creator will be seeded with, allowing them to start visualising the key looks and conceptualising the art direction. Background information on the product story is also shared as an education component and, finally, key deliverable information is outlined, i.e. timeline for delivery of content.The vision for NTWRK Area3 is to continue co-creating with local talent and giving young creators the opportunity to collaborate with the Adidas Originals brand and to create a platform that is authentic and true to local culture.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/503816.jpg" alt="Hana Jayne, one of the young creatives collaborating with Adidas’s NTWRK Area3.

Jayne grew up around Cape Town and is half Japanese, half South African. “Throughout my life, I've been an avid drawer and painter, which evolved into other mediums, such as photography, which I grew a strong liking for,” she tells us. “Thereafter I spent my free time practising and teaching myself my new passion. I began modelling/acting at around 16-17, mainly working on commercials, which I still pursue as a part-time job alongside my photographic jobs and passion projects. After spending my gap year working on commercials, I saved up to start studying Motion Design at the Cape Town Creative Academy in 2018, where I am now in my second year and ever so grateful to be there. It truly is the best institution. I've always had a knack for film, animation and design; so I know I'm at the right place.”“My current objective is to focus on building my skill in *VJing. And that's where I am at now."Here, Jayne shares more about who she is, why it's important for brands to support and collaborate with young creative talent and what brands need to keep in mind when marketing to young people..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How did you become involved with NTWRK Area3?I remember some time ago when Area3 launched, I was invited by some friends to check out the studio. I was away for a couple of months then, so didn’t get to join in on the fun. But sometime near the end of last year, I got an email to shoot a small project for NTWRK Area3, which was exciting. I guess they liked me and asked me again after that. Haha. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why do you think it’s important for brands to support and collaborate, particularly with young creatives?I think the creative industry is incredibly competitive, which isn’t particularly a bad thing, but many talented young artists need that foot-up that isn’t always in reach. It becomes a mutually benefiting. As a young creative, it is incredibly rewarding to be able to work and be supported by a brand such as Adidas. But at the same time, brands can benefit hugely from a fresh, young creative perspective and mind..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us about your most memorable projects to date?I thoroughly enjoyed working on three small animations for NTWRK Area3. I was afraid to take on the project because I’m only a beginner and still only in my second year of studying Motion Design, but what’s great about NTWRK Area3 is that they support that, even if you’re not highly skilled. It’s about supporting the learning process.

Everything is fast-paced, being aware of the world around us, representation, spreading valuable information, supporting, teaching, learning, inspiring… and adapting to change. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What drives you and what are some of the things that you are passionate about?I’m driven by excitement and growth. If you’re excited about something, and it becomes fun (as opposed to a task) it really shines through. You learn through that, I think, instead of forcing yourself to grow. Otherwise, I’m driven to better myself and to inspire others. My passion for creating and inspiring people ties into that. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Who are some of your role models?Perhaps corny, but some of the people closest to me, such as Omri Dahan and Inka Kendzia. Otherwise, at the moment I’m super inspired by Petra Collins, Rosie Matheson and Maisie Williams. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1207/107361-120x120.jpg" alt="Creative directions and evolutions with The Grrrl" width="120" height="120">Creative directions and evolutions with The GrrrlInka Kendzia, best known for her VJ-ing skills; behind the decks and in front of the audio-influenced video montage amazingness that she creates under the moniker The Grrrl, tells us how it all began, the concept behind recent video for Mr Sakitumi (her husband and musical soulmate) and how "ideas can lead to cultural evolution".By Ruth Cooper 6 Jul 2012.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What advice would you like to convey to all the young creatives out there?Lots of YouTube tutorials, practice, reach out for advice and be as humble and genuine as you possibly can.*Google definition: VJing is a broad designation for real-time visual performance.
