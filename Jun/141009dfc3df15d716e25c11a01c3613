Considering this message within the theme Making an Impact, the creative team encompassed the Hogan Lovells distinctive corporate identity and the firm’s brand pillars: understanding, respecting, investing and operating in Africa - crafting a thoughtful, proudly African solution.Beginning with the event corporate identity, the logo was developed to demonstrate the ripple effect Africa has on the world and the potential that it holds. This logo illustrates how design can bring the key message of the summit to life. The bold iconography of the logo represents the positive impact that Africa has on the global community. An outward ripple effect symbolises Africa’s positive impact deep within the world, radiating from its shores across the globe. Abena Poku, Hogan Lovells Senior Marketing and Business Development Manager for Africa comments on the creative work by Boomtown: “Using an African woman within the visuals places a spotlight on the contribution women make to the economy and business in Africa. African women have been called ‘a powerful untapped economic force’ and are integral in addressing the development challenges Africa faces, the visuals address Making an Impact perfectly, without saying a word.”
