His expertise lies in building valued long-term relationships, which translate into exceptional business results. In stepping into his new role, Kevin acknowledged the tough current trading environment, saying that successful organisations are drawing closer to their customers through gaining improved insights into market conditions, which are helping them better understand their clients and their specific needs at this time. “Research is our clients’ insurance partner, and we are their trusted advisors. We aim to respond to this greater need for strategic insights by transforming our own business through tapping into our agility as well as technology innovation, which together will further improve our research solutions, customer insights and consulting capabilities. This will drive value and deliver growth for our partners – two returns greatly needed in this economy,” he says.Kevin took over from Pearson on 3 June 2019. Pearson has no immediate plans following his exit from BMI Research, only a three-month sabbatical to gain “renewed perspective” before beginning the next chapter in his career. His association with BMi Research and Cognition Holdings will continue in his capacity as a shareholder of Cognition Holdings.“The journey of taking a fledgling BMi back in 2000, growing it and developing it into the present day BMi Research has been a tremendous privilege, and has brought about enormous satisfaction. As the company has grown, so have the people. That has been exhilarating to watch. However, it is now time to make way for fresh eyes, fresh thinking and fresh inspiration to take the business forward to the next level, and to introduce innovation to further add value to BMi Research’s clients,” explains Pearson.This will be a core focus area for Kevin, whose responsibilities as CEO will include executive leadership of the company strategy, leading the Exco team, being responsible to the BMi Research Board, and ensuring client satisfaction throughout the various BMi Research teams.BMi Research is a highly reputable brand name that is trusted in the industry and known for providing superior-quality research services. It boasts a dynamic, proficient team of industry experts equipped with extensive experience across a range of sectors. Kevin is looking forward to working with this team, and continuing to build the client-centric relationships and research solutions for which the company is renowned.
