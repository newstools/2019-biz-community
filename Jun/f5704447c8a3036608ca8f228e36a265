Heidi Brauer, Hollard Insurance CMO and chairperson of the Marketer of the Year sub-committee, says: Viviers is completely deserving of the Marketer of the Year award, for marketing leadership consistency, and a track record of solid business results. He is an inspirational marketer who really understands that marketing is both science and art by harmonising gut and experience with data.

There were 480 entries, which is remarkable for the inaugural year. “These winners set a high benchmark for the industry and raise the bar for local marketers. These are the people who bring the art and science of marketing to life. They keep disrupting to stay ahead of the pack.”Future-proofing marketingThe judges followed a rigorous and methodologically-sound adjudication process to ensure that the process was fair and robust.Fascinating insights were shared and there was lively discussion at the Marketing Achievement Summit with the theme “Future-proofing marketing” that took place earlier today. The topics explored included the future of marketing and communications; how to build a brand across Africa’s diverse countries; how to market with meaning and purpose; how to manage your brand’s reputation in an “always on” communications landscape; and how to build Brand South Africa in a way that stimulates growth.Disclaimer: Bizcommunity's Leigh Andrews was on the jury, lead by Heidi Brauer for Marketer of the Year.
