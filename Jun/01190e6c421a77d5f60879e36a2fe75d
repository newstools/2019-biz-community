What does that add to your judging ability? This is my first time judging Cannes. It will be interesting to see how the dynamics in the judging room play out versus other international awards. Judging Cannes gives me the opportunity to see ideas from around the world with different cultural contexts to mine. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1805/442317-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Neo Mashigo, CCO at M&amp;C Saatchi Group SA." width="120" height="120">Neo Mashigo is the new CCO of M&C Saatchi Group SANeo Mashigo, who joined M&C Saatchi Group SA a year ago, has been appointed CCO...28 May 2018I’ll get to see how other creatives package their ideas to give them global appeal and understanding.I’m particularly looking to see how other judges perceive work that is not Hollywood-esque.Because as South Africans, we always have to choose carefully when it comes to what we enter. We base our decision on whether the work is Cannes Lions-friendly or not. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Share a few of your favourite Cannes Lions-related moments over the years – either from attending personally or agency winning work-related. It was when South Africa won its first Cannes Lions Grand Prix in 2006, in the Print & Publication category with FCB for Lego. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/501225.jpg" alt="SA's first Cannes Lions Grand Prix-winning work, by FCB for Lego in 2006." width="625" height="391">SA's first Cannes Lions Grand Prix-winning work, by FCB for Lego in 2006.At the time, we knew as South Africans that we were right up there with the best when it comes to advertising, but we needed to win the Grand Prix. That year we did, and it was amazing to witness. That Grand Prix opened the doors for us to win our own Grand Prix, and it has now become a normal thing for South Africa to do so. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}It has! Which category of work are you judging this year? Fittingly, I’m judging Print and Publication, the oldest category in advertising where almost everything has been done, but every year agencies around the world prove that we’ll never run out of great ideas. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Love that. What do this year’s 7 SA creatives bring to the global Cannes Lions judging mix? We bring the South African flavour and style, an angle that has that David and Goliath energy. We make Cannes global!<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495901-120x120.jpg?3" alt="7 SA creatives selected to judge Cannes Lions 2019" width="120" height="120">7 SA creatives selected to judge Cannes Lions 2019Seven South African creatives have been selected as judges for this year's Cannes Lions...9 May 2019.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Give us a glimpse of the specific criteria you’ll be looking for in judging this year's entries. I’m passionate around story and in my category, it’s brought to life in a picture. I love to see work from other cultures in the world shine. It’s always so refreshing. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}With other international award shows D&AD and the One Show having wrapped up for the year, any predictions of creative trends that are likely to stand out at Cannes Lions 2019? I think purpose-driven work will still come up strong, led by conscious consumerism. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1712/421258-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#BizTrends2018: Conscious consumption" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2018: Conscious consumptionI'm not that big on food trends, to be honest. I find gimmicks and 'flavour of the month' offerings a very slippery slope. That said, I do think established chefs, producers and industry thought-leaders who have the ability to change with the times are critical for the industry.By Andy Fenner 9 Jan 2018Everyone wants a better world with nicer people. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to from the Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity 2019? I’m looking forward to seeing the work and hearing from the people that create the work. At Cannes, you can engage with the clients and creatives that make work that you wish you had made! While main judging only takes place in Cannes next week, watch for the SA judges’ specific predictions of the work that will win, later this week! The Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity runs from 17 to 21 June 2019, with Cinemark – now known as Ster-Kinekor Sales – the local representatives of Cannes Lions for SA.
