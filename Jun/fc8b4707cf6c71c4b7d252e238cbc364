<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/500752.jpg" alt="OFM helping to free someone's future this Youth Day" width="625" height="469">OFM wants to help one person, who cannot receive their qualification due to an outstanding tuition account balance, to settle their debt and receive their qualification. To qualify, any person between the ages of 18 and 35, can email their contact details, motivation, student account, proof of enrolment and copy of ID to future@ofm.co.zabRev('brev-cac3dfb3-c7a7-43f3-bfc4-ef6af36dfc01', '>a/\<az.oc.mfo@erutuf>"az.oc.mfo;46#&erutuf:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<'). The lucky winner could receive R10,000 to help Free Your Future. Says Lindiwe Mtwentula, OFM Marketing Manager: “Student debt prevents many young people to move on with their future.  Even though a student may have passed all their subjects and could graduate, higher education institutions refuse to release results until all outstanding accounts are settled.  For some, the unfortunate truth is that they just don’t have the funds to do it.  The #FreeYourFuture competition hopes to help one such a person to finally graduate and embark on a career path.”The winner will be announced live on air on 17 July 2019 during the Just Plain Drive show.
