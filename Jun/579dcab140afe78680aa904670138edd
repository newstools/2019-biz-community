FCB Joburg linked the promotion to the word ‘popa’, an everyday expression conveying the feeling of winning in life or hitting the jackpot. This translated into the key take-out: "Popa every time you go large with Debonairs Pizza Friendzy®". The ad was shot in Diepkloof, Soweto, over one day by Director Kit of Darling Films. You can view it here: https://youtu.be/VJteVtnxJeE. Joubert anticipates reaction from Debonairs Pizza fans will be huge, and that they’ll go out of their way to participate in the Friendzy®. “From the fans’ point of view, this promotion is the proverbial ‘popa’ that puts a spring in your step and a smile on your face,” she said. “Not only are there 3.3 million individual guaranteed instant rewards ranging from flight vouchers, shopping vouchers, spa vouchers, airtime, data, movie tickets, fashion vouchers or Debonairs Pizza vouchers to be shared, there’s the opportunity to win one of the grand prizes such as a TV, car or holiday,” she continued. “While this promotion gives us the opportunity to show our customers our appreciation for their support, it also gives us the chance to add even more excitement and joy into their lives. We are hoping this will start a real frenzy of pizza enjoyment with friends over the next few months.” Credits:Client: Debonairs PizzaMarketing Executive: Toni JoubertMarketing Manager: Monica SitholeBrand Manager: Pamela MakhalemeleCampaign: Debonairs Pizza Friendzy® ‘Popa’Creative agency: FCB Joburg    Business Unit Director: Mogani NaidooAccount Director: Kefilwe KhandaAccount Manager: Kaylyn NaickerChief Creative Officer: Ahmed TillyCreative Director: Greg Cameron            Copywriter: Marvin Mpanda Art director: Ole Tshelto Traffic Manager: Theresa Selema                       TV production: Sindi Hirchowitz              Media planners: Jedd Cokayne & Sulize Janse Van Vuuren                     Production companies: Darling Films                 Directors: Keitumetse Qhali                    Editor: Marcel Mouton                           Post-production: Post ModernAudio post-production: AudioPhile
