While the deliberate invention of fake stories to amuse or mislead is as old as society itself, the advent of social media has changed the playing field forever. Now truth and fiction can be presented in such similar ways that they can become almost impossible to tell apart. And with more people than ever accessing the news through social media, more of them are seeing – and sometimes believing – information that is not only inaccurate, but actually fabricated.A recent study conducted at Northeastern University in Boston and published in Science, has shown that, while it is almost impossible to quantify exposure to fake content, the problem is big. This is partly because it is amplified – and sometimes even created – by publications with inadequate editorial processes. This means that the only way in which readers can sort the good from the bad and the ugly is to know which sources to trust. Amasa (the Advertising and Media Association of South Africa) has identified the impact of false content as one of the greatest threats to media credibility, both at present and in the long term. An important strategic objective is therefore to equip media stakeholders across the board with the knowledge they need to identify and deal with it as effectively as possible. The Amasa Ignite Forum, a premier forum for discussion about issues of importance to the advertising and media industries, will therefore be hosting a debate entitled “The impact of fake content on consumers, publishers and brands” on Wednesday, 3 July 2019 in Sandton. This will be followed by a networking event at which participants will be able to share and discuss their experiences of encountering and having had to deal with false content. Join thought leaders in the fields of publishing, communications and brands to discuss the nature of the threat, the way in which it impacts on consumers, the ways in which it can affect brand reputation, how it is evolving, and how best to manage the risk it presents. Panelists include: Daniel Munslow, Founder MCC consulting  Wayne Bishop, PHD Media  Nkateko Mongwe, Vodacom Fatima Ouanssaidi, OnPoint PR Colson Mothoagae, The OddNumber Chris Louw, Hive Digital Media Tickets to the debate are free but limited, so book now to secure your place.
