With music from DJs Menzi XL and Chuck Tailored, as well as performance art by Darkie Fiction, the space came alive for patrons who ‘hard sold out’ the event. Those in attendance moved through the venue with a full view of artworks on display and were also offered an opportunity to interact with the exhibitors. Of course, no Yogi Sip experience is complete without samples of the different flavours the brand has to offer. Yogi Sip snacks were served in the form of smoothies, which showcased the versatility of the product. To cap off the experience, attendees had fun with the Yogi Sip Photobooth where pictures were rendered as part of a few souvenirs for the day. According to Thabani Khumalo, Brand Manager at Danone, “As a brand Yogi Sip firmly believes in the youth and that’s why we commit to fueling their creativity and dreams. We want Yogi Sip to play a tangible role in driving growth and opening doors to those who see and act beyond the boundaries to build a better future.” Yogi Sip’s partnering agency Brave Group’s Bravado is bringing this vision to life by creating meaningful connections between Yogi Sip, its people and communities. The winning exhibitor at the event will receive R10,000 in prize money, as well as a potential contract to design next year’s Yogi Sip pack for #YouthMonth.
