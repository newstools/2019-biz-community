"June 16 is a historical and significant day for the people of South Africa, particularly the youth. We have taken inspiration from this and invited six Grade 11 learners to experience a career in media. We like to think of ourselves as a champion for young people, it is part of our company culture. We have a very successful annual internship programme that has resulted in fulltime employment for all its participants, and earlier this year we launched our bursary programme that provided funding for five media professionals to upskill. Our Youth Month campaign is just an evolution of our continuing support of young talent," Candy Dempers, MediaHeads 360 Managing Director, explains.MediaHeads 360’s Youth Month initiative is a three-day work immersion that takes place from Tuesday, 25 June to Thursday, 27 June. Learners will shadow MediaHeads 360 employees, some of whom are former interns themselves, and gain comprehensive knowledge about sound engineering, copywriting and media management. The learners will spend time with the organisation’s management team as well as the operations team to learn about their day-to-day working life and gain valuable insights into possible career path. “We believe there is a real power in the youth, a hunger to succeed. We were all there at one stage in our careers, just looking for a place to channel our passion, for someone to give us a chance. Someone gave each one of us here at MediaHeads 360 a chance and that is why it is important for us to pay it forward, to give back. We believe that our investment in the youth will help channel that youthful energy into positive spaces that will build and develop South Africa,” Dempers added.Follow our learner’s Job Shadow journey on MediaHeads 360’s social media channels.
