Every year, both corporate and small-business leaders across all industry sectors come together with the aim of sharing practical lessons, useful insights, and to unlock new ways of collaboration.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/501279.jpg" alt="2019 In Good Company Conference to celebrate 'Art of Business'" width="625" height="417">“This year’s theme is the 'Art of Business' and aims to showcase and celebrate businesses who have embraced creative solutions to solve complex business issues, while at the same time contributing positively in their communities. Our aim is to inspire and equip businesses to lead social change and leave a legacy in our nation,” explains Paschal.“Business is a powerful medium that has the influence to bring about the change we’d like to see in South Africa. The conference is crafted for delegates to discover how they can evolve corporate social investment strategies that will create business solutions for complex social problems,” says Paschal.“Managing a successful impact-driven business requires more than lateral thinking. In mastering the art of business, leaders need a deep sense of awareness and understanding of how their business is uniquely positioned to make a difference in the lives of its staff, its various stakeholders, broader society, and the nation,” says Paschal.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/501280.jpg" alt="2019 In Good Company Conference to celebrate 'Art of Business'" width="625" height="417">2019 speaker lineupThis year the conference will again feature South African musician Majozi to entertain guests, and will also once again be hosted by Dr Michael Mol.
