While confirming this development, Innocent Kawooya, CEO of HiPipo, said entries must be in by 30 June 2019. “The 6th edition of the digital impact awards is here. All individuals and companies leading the digital and financial inclusion revolution are encouraged to submit their entries in the over 20 categories listed on the project portal. This is a critical process and highly impacts the project in its entirety,” Kawooya noted. “Just like last year, we are again running under the bigger Include EveryOne program. We believe that an economy that includes everyone benefits everyone. As such, this program sensitises operators and service providers to bring financial services to the poor through the use of innovative business models, and mobile technology.“We also believe that successful and impactful financial inclusion efforts must be well researched, modelled, positioned, promoted, marketed, distributed, and critiqued as well as celebrated and awarded where possible,” he said. This year’s Include EveryOne program will involve a collection of interlinked financial inclusion outreach projects, such as a hackathon, expo, summit, awards and research. The highlighted projects will be managed in a synchronised way to obtain maximum benefits of ensuring impactful engagement of financial inclusion stakeholders to effectively promote approaches that will enable financial inclusion for everyone.
