By partnering with entrepreneurs, who often have limited time and experience with managing the finances of their company, EasyBiz creates partnerships reaching past supplier and consumers, by offering business tools and localised support.“In a market filled with established competitors, EasyBiz needed to try a different approach to gain visibility. Drawing on our expertise in Search Engine Optimisation and social marketing, our team relished the challenge that partnering with EasyBiz presented. We look forward to the months ahead as the strategy we’ve prepared rolls out,” said DigitLab CEO, Mike Saunders. “We’re wanting to engage with real, South African business people who would benefit from the use of our products,” said EasyBiz, Kim Immelmann, “Across South Africa, there are so many people exploring self-employment, but a large percentage don’t make it very far for a number of reasons – mismanaged finances being one of them. We started as a small business too, so we build our services around what we think entrepreneurs need and structure our product offerings accordingly.”Speaking of their recent partnership with DigitLab, they said, “It was important for us to utilise a digital agency that can target people who would be looking for the kinds of things we offer. Just like small business owners; you want the best results for as small an investment as possible. DigitLab have a great track record in helping companies reach the people their businesses are aimed at, so this partnership was an easy decision.
