Only the very best work will be awarded with a Gerety”, mentioned Co-founder Lucía Ongay.Elevating new female voicesExecutive jury member Genevieve Hoey, Group ECD at R/GA explained: “The Gerety Awards was a room of super diverse senior creatives, passionately debating work and ideas. It should be irrelevant to know that we were all women. But it’s not. Award shows like The Gerety matter to our industry right now. Elevating new female voices in the discourse on creativity, including more seats at the table to discuss what work should be celebrated-or not – will positively shape the future of a more diverse and inclusive industry we can all be proud to work in.” Following this sentiment, executive jury member Lixaida Lorenzo, GCD at David & Goliath added: “Judging at the Gerety Awards was refreshing. It was a room filled with talented creative leaders that were genuinely just about making sure only extraordinary ideas rose to the top. The room was mostly on the same page on what was really great and what was really not. No politics to navigate. “Ambassador and grand jury member Tista Sen, regional creative director, Wunderman Thompson South Asia said: “The Gerety Awards in spearheading this announces an all-new way in which creative work is perceived. Judging work with women across the table is a whole new learning experience. The entire experience was fun, insightful with a nuanced discussion. And yes, we all fell in love with advertising all over again”.The grand jury will now choose the final winners which will be announced at the end of July. The full shortlist can be viewed here.
