We’re preparing for a future when uncapped data is affordable to all in Africa and video on demand becomes the norm. We’ve been delivering TV series and movies for almost four years and continue to see strong growth in usage. Sport is the obvious next target and the only way to do that properly is to be able to stream it live.”The new sport section is available on most Showmax apps and platforms except for Apple TV, Xbox and Playstation, and some smart TVs (support will be added for these in the coming months). The sport content is currently available exclusively in South Africa.The price of Showmax remains unchanged at R99 per month (R49 per month for DStv Compact and Compact Plus subscribers, free to DStv Premium subscribers).“The obvious question is where to from here? We’re going to trial a bunch of different sport content while keeping Showmax at the R99 price point, and see how our customers interact with the service. We’ll be ramping up our live game offerings with everything from selected matches from the best football leagues in Europe to streaming a wide variety of varsity and school sports,” concludes Ekdahl.To get Showmax, visit www.showmax.com.
