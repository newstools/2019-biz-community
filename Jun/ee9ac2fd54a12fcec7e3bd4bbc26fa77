The D&AD Pencil is regarded as one of the creative industry’s highest accolades with juries only selecting work they believe is truly exceptional. This, plus the fact that there are no quotas for awards at D&AD, means the number of awarded entries fluctuates year to year. In some years, no Black Pencils - reserved for work that is groundbreaking within its field - are awarded; the record currently stands at just seven. In total, 718 Pencils were awarded at D&AD Awards 2019. The number of Pencils awarded by level and number of entries that were shortlisted, are as follows: Black Pencil - 6 Pencils (2 Advertising, 2 Design, 2 Craft)Yellow Pencil - 58 PencilsGraphite Pencil - 195 PencilsWood Pencil - 459 PencilsShortlisted - 889New for 2019, the D&AD Awards Shortlist was introduced this year in order to acknowledge the volume of high calibre submissions that, even if they didn’t win a Pencil, were in close consideration.D&AD CEO Tim Lindsay commented: It has been another outstanding year for global creativity, and after careful calculations, we are proud to be able to recognise the networks and regions who have collectively delivered the most outstanding creative work from the past year. I can confidently say that the work we have seen over this year’s D&AD Awards has been an inspiration that will prove to be an invaluable resource for creatives worldwide within this year’s Annual.Winning work will be displayed at exhibitions globally over the following year and featured in the D&AD Annual and online archive – the definitive guide for creatives all around the world.
