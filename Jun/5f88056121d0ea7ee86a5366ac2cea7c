Representing Upside at Madex this year, Vlismas spoke about happiness. Vlismas explained that he’s been making people laugh for a long time but, over time, he realised that that happiness is short-lived, and so it is that he and a handful of people formed Upside to help companies and people learn about the nature of happiness, the role the brain plays in sustaining it, and what it is we can do, as business, to ensure people are happy for a long time. “Because happy people lead to happy, profitable, sustainable businesses,” he said. Vlismas delved into the brain, explaining that at the base of it all, we’re just evolved apes that can be (and are) easily manipulated. He cited examples of studies that have proven that the human brain is less flawless and evolved than we’d like to think, but is rather highly and easily manipulated, like:  The Invisible Gorilla, which saw a focus group of people completely miss a man dressed in a gorilla suit walking in and amongst the people they’d been asked to study.  Yuval Harari’s research that proved inter-subjective entities depend on communication among humans rather than on the convictions and feelings of the individual humans.  Jordan Peterson’s belief that every object or situation can be perceived, in an infinite number of ways and each action or event has an infinite number of potential consequences. Vlismas and the team at Upside say it’s really simple: our perception has been hacked. Companies have been hacking our brains for as long as advertising and marketing came to be. This means, we believe things that are potentially toxic are needed to make us happy. We have access to more information at a faster pace than ever before and while you’re online looking for things, they are looking for you. Data is getting more organised than ever before and it’s being used to manipulate your brain into believing it needs things to be happy. Facebook’s utter randomness is very strategically set up – you check in on your likes more frequently and are thus exposed to more advertising. As a result, we want more. More money, more stuff, more youth, more success – and when we find it, it makes us happy (for a while) but 100 percent of the time, we quickly go back to the flat 70 percent happiness level most human beings maintain. Upside says the things that contribute to actual happiness are altruism, gratitude, belief, connectedness, and partnership. Notice how not one of these things involves a product. “We know how to build and sustain human happiness and we’re spreading the news,” he said. “We can talk to each other without fighting or becoming polarised. It may seem completely insane but the fact is that South Africa is primed to be the laboratory that solves racism –we just have to same page this happiness story.”Fine. I’m fine. No, really, I’m Fine. Following on Vlismas’ heels and thanking Madex for the stellar opening act, was Jacaranda FM’s general manager, Kevin Fine, who discussed the content eco-system as it used to be, what it looks like now and how content needs to evolve to comprehensively address every area in it. Newspaper is a dead industry, Fine said, after he checked the room for members of the old order (of which there are none) but, he said, if you pay proper attention, there are a few bastions who realised early that they’d have to adapt their content offering in order to survive. There may be paper in their hands, but their news is online, and it includes podcasts, tweets and Instagram-worthy images. The content economy, as Fine calls it, is a system of cogs that cannot operate without one another – it includes a brand that talks to radio, the web, podcasts, mobile, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube. It is in content and the content economy that, if you hit the sweet spot at just the right time, you’ll see your business soar, he said. Branding of yore saw marketing experts taking a brand and putting it online, monitoring “eyeballs” on the site – today, we’re more interested in bounces, and heat maps – the eco-system has changed. Used to be a brand couldn’t always be “on” – not anymore. The world is always on, South Africa might sleep but someone somewhere is looking for something all the time!It’s time to start thinking bigger than your immediate space, said Fine. “Spend on podcasts in the US last year ran to around $314 million with an expected increase of $1.2 billion in the year to come,” he added. “People are choosing to listen to good content – are you tapping into that?“Videos running on screens in banks are a waste of money unless those banks are sharing these to online platforms. The full video on YouTube, a shorter, neater snippet for Twitter or Facebook, and you have an effective piece of content that has been shaped for each platform – suddenly, 100 eyes turn into two million.”To close, Fine urged visitors to get their hands dirty, to play with content possibilities and learn and share because success in South Africa for businesses depend on content evolution today.
