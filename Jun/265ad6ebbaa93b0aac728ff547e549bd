Bizcommunity freelance editor Danette Breitenbach has been invited to moderate and MC the TEDx-style event, which will feature five highly regarded speakers. Breitenbach, a heavyweight industry commentator, who recently led a panel of BizTrends speakers at the IAB Summit 2019, is the perfect choice to ensure the presentations and Q&A format will add value for delegates and speakers. The event, which will form part of the APEX Awards 2019, is being held the morning prior to the annual Gala Awards ceremony. This yearâ€™s theme is AFRICA. THE REVOLUTION. As a proud media partner, Bizcommunity, in collaboration with the ACA and APEX, will bring you all the coverage of the masterclass and gala event.
