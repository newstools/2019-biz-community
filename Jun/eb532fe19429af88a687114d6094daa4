The authors stress the importance of learning to love intelligently rather than emotionally, encouraging couples to stand (not fall) in love. The Bulletproof Marriage stands pose the question: Have you prepared to live happily ever after? Engaged couples place considerable focus on the wedding day but need to invest in their marriage which begins when the celebration ends. Bulletproof Marriage: Your shield against divorce shares wisdom on how to love intelligently, provides tools to manage marriage successfully and explains why relationships fail. Based on the authors’ personal experience of a difficult first few years of marriage, as well as years of counselling couples internationally, the book provides practical advice and is an essential, life-changing relationship toolkit. Even in the happiest partnership, challenges arise and people require skills to shield relationships from complacency, crises, destruction and divorce. Without being addressed, small differences can easily escalate into insurmountable problems. The Cardosos write: Your relationship is a precious treasure. Your loved one is extremely valuable. Discover the importance of shielding your marriage. Equip yourself with knowledge to enhance your relationship. Invest in yourself, your partner and your future. In the second book, 120 Minutes to Shield your Marriage, the authors focus on the power of just one minute, writing: In just one minute, a single action can change your life forever. A word spoken at the right time, a small change in behaviour, or even reading a page of a book can make all the difference. One minute can change everything.This book contains 120 different bulletproofing tips which can be read in less than a minute. Each tip has options to:Implement that piece of advice if this is an area you need to improveRemember good tips for things that need reinforcementShare the tip for things you want to explore with your spouseThe 120 bulletproofing tips in this book are based on the authors’ experiences and the solutions they found to strengthen their relationship and say no to divorce. This book has given many couples useful tools to help them overcome obstacles and discover the importance of shielding their marriage and making it bulletproof. Renato and Cristiane Cardoso say: “Learn to love intelligently. Invest in your relationship and ensure you live happily ever after!” The Bulletproof Marriage team offers free, confidential, non-judgemental counselling both at the Wedding Expo and at any time a couple may wish to benefit from talking to a couple who have learned to love intelligently by applying wisdom contained in the international bestsellers. The counsellors say that one of the most important aspects of a successful marriage, which is often overlooked, is to discover what your partner’s expectations are. Often one party has no idea what the problem is because the other does not express their needs or expectations. People are not mind-readers so it is essential to discuss what you expect of the other person and to clarify roles and duties so that both people contribute what has been agreed to the partnership. For counselling, book sales or further information, please contact the Bulletproof Marriage team on 011 224 3413 or info@bulletproofmarriage.orgbRev('brev-23ea5949-7408-4553-9220-86b4484b975e', '>a/\<gro.egairramfoorptellub;46#&ofni>"gro.egairramfoorptellub;46#&ofni:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
