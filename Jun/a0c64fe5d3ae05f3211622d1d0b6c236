Since Bashir's ouster last month, a transitional military council has ruled Sudan, while protesters continue to call for a civilian government."The raid and closure of Al-Jazeera's Khartoum bureau is a worrying sign that Sudan's military rulers intend to suppress coverage of pro-democracy events," said CPJ Middle East and North Africa coordinator Sherif Mansour. "This action belies military leaders' statements that they intend to serve and protect the public; they should immediately reverse course and allow Al-Jazeera to operate freely."In January, Sudanese security officials revoked the credentials of international journalists who covered protests against Bashir, including correspondents for Al-Jazeera and Al Arabiya, the outlets reported.
