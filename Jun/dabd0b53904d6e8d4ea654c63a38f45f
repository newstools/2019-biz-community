The media tend to only report in extremes and not involving children in stories about them, which is a big missed opportunity. Children are not on the agenda yet they should be, as the future of the country. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497966-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: Refreshing the legalities of ethical reporting on children" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Refreshing the legalities of ethical reporting on childrenWith #YouthMonth just around the corner, what better time to put the focus on how to more ethically report on violence against children?By Leigh Andrews 27 May 2019 One reason for steering clear of including their voices is uncertainty over the legalities – an unfortunate case of ‘red light ethics’ at its best.Another is uncertainty over how to get children to open up and share their side. That’s why in the final session of Media Monitoring Africa (MMA) and the UCT Children’s Institute’s media workshop on ethical reporting on violence against children, MMA legal consultant Taryn Hinton shared three tips and techniques to use when interviewing children.1. Create a child-friendly interview environmentIn creating a child-friendly interview environment, you’ll be able to get more meaningful input and quotations from your interviewees.This boils down to reducing the parent-child power parityYou can do so by:Avoiding titles,Sticking with a first-name basis, andEnsuring you are literally on the same level by reducing your stature – sit on chairs or crouch down.Hinton says to also share your experiences as a child and speak of your own children.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/499486-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The world then and now, and how the way we protect our children needs to change" width="120" height="120">The world then and now, and how the way we protect our children needs to changeThis National Child Protection Week (CPW), Google South Africa and Media Monitoring Africa hosted a roundtable putting a spotlight on the importance of online safety for children...By Jessica Tennant 31 May 2019Get involved to get more responses. Play games with the children and don’t sit on the sidelines.2. Create a relaxed environmentHinton says to choose a spot that’s away from distractions – private but still in clear view. Ensure it’s warm, well ventilated, well-lit and spacious enough to accommodate your activities.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/499515-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: A picture tells a thousand words, but should it?People are never just a means to your journalistic end, especially when it comes to children. Their stories are our work, and when you work to add their authentic voices, it automatically changes the angle of the story for the better. But what about images of children in news articles? Media Monitoring Africa and the UCT Children's Institute media workshop on 22 May at the Doubletree Hilton...By Leigh Andrews 3 Jun 2019Let the children see your recording equipment and hold it so they are more comfortable with it.Hinton also said, “Don’t feel you need to fill the silence with words. That’s an adult thing.”3. Engage in appropriate activitiesLastly, explaining appropriate activities to include in the interview process with children, Hinton mentioned drawing, ranking, mapping, acting or drama, and deflection projection to create distance but still get them to talk to you about their own story.Sitting shoulder-to-shoulder while engaged in an activity together is less intimidating than face-to-face, and don’t be afraid to kick off your shoes and sit on the floor. With tight deadlines you don’t have much time to get the interview but these tips will help set children at ease and tell you their side of the story. Taking steps to be more inclusive of society overall will instantly add authenticity to your reporting.Hinton ended by appealing to attendees to aim to write more solution-based articles rather than just explaining the situation – leave the audience with something positive or inspiring, where the situation allows.The UCT Children’s Institute houses a reporters’ research hub – visit it for further tips.
