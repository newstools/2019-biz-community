An increasing number of hidden champions are developing their brands in a targeted way, and are making ongoing brand management a fixed component of their corporate strategy,” explains Andrej Kupetz, chair of the jury for the German Brand Awards and CEO of the German Design Council. “As well as a generally greater awareness of the importance of branding and brand management, this development is driven by factors including labour shortage, progressive internationalisation, digitalisation and generational change.”Kupetz concludes: Overall there is a clear trend towards the professionalisation of brand work – across all industries and irrespective of company size. This goes hand in hand with a deeper understanding of the significance of brands, and insights into the need for ongoing brand management with a long-term perspective.In the “Excellent Brands” category, awards went to the best product or company brand within a particular industry. The top performers in different specialist disciplines were honoured in the category “Excellence in Brand Strategy, Management and Creation”.
