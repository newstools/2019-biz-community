I love the way we’re all connected one way or another; the world starts to feel small in a way, and because the industry is small, my rule of thumb is to be nice to everyone! You never know when the game can change.6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. My morning starts super early. I’m up at 4am every morning. We start hair and make-up at 4:45am, the live show starts at 6am and we wrap at 9am. I usually get out of the studios by 9:30am and will generally head to my next shoot for the day. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/469819-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Wastie captions this: Jy dink jy’s cooler as ek?" width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with...

The Flash Drive ends at 7pm, and that’s when I usually head to gym or meet friends for a quick dinner.7. What are the tools of your trade?It’s all me! I don’t play a character on TV or radio. I’m myself in the mornings as well as the afternoons. It’s important for me to always stay true to myself - but with that being said, I often feel vulnerable.  When people criticise, they criticise me as I constantly share a lot of personal information, but that’s why I also cherish my private life and “me time” so much. 8. Who is getting it right in your industry? The likes of Leigh-Anne Williams, Jo-Ann Strauss, Tracey Lange and Bonang Matheba, to name a few. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/482084-120x120.jpg?2" alt="This may or may not be Williams' best angle…" width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with...

List a few pain points the industry can improve on. I personally feel the industry can be opened up more; allow new and upcoming talent opportunities. We should also celebrate and highlight local content more often, and instead of teasing, we need to be fully invested.10. What are you working on right now?I’m trying to free up my schedule – it has been consumed with work and I need to find balance.

Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself.Securing that bag! Meaning you’re booking those gigs and making that money.12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? I find myself most creative in the early hours of the morning, after a break and a travel trip!         View this post on Instagram           Time to head home. I can’t wait to share with you what I got up to in Malawi. I was told that this would be a life changing trip, and it truly was. I return to SA recharged, refocused and with a renewed purpose ���� A post shared by  Zoë Brown (@zbzoebrown) on Mar 10, 2019 at 6:30am PDT 13. What’s your secret talent/party trick?I can break into song on the last word you’ve said. It can either be hilarious or annoying as I hardly know the lyrics to the songs; however, my versions are always entertaining! 14. Are you a technophobe or a technophile?I’m a technophile to a certain extent. I love upgrading my phone and having the latest apps – but I also keep things simplistic. I can accomplish a lot of tasks on my phone alone, and that’s good enough for me.15. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? You’d find loads of home décor-inspired pictures from Pinterest. I’m in the process of moving and as such, I’ve been looking at lounge ideas!16. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry?Keep being yourself; rejection is not always a reflection of you but rather that of the industry. It’s all about timing – by staying true to yourself and your talents, your timing will come.          View this post on Instagram           Last night I had to prove Eksom wrong.
