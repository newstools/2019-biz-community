"The coming on board of AMA was a real shot in the arm for the summit. Not only will they bring on board media expertise but will also help steer our agenda to the highest level. This year's summit theme, Intra-African Trade: Beyond Rhetoric and Political Commitments, is totally in line with what AMA strives for." African countries over the years have adopted a number of Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) intended to promote trade among themselves, such as the Protocol on Free Movement of Persons, Right to Residence and Right to Establishment, the Single African Air Transport Market (SAATM), as well as the landmark Africa Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA, a landmark agreement which the UN Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) estimates will boost intra-Africa trade by 52.3%. The "Policymakers' Roundtable Session on Intra-Regional Trade" is a High-level for key domestic and international policymakers from across AU member states and the International Development Institutions, as well as policymakers from Europe, United States and Asia, to engage in a candid and constructive dialogue on recent developments on intra-Africa trade. The partnership positions AMA as the official media partner for this noble event. AMA will use its vast skills and network to promote the visibility of the event. "As an authoritative voice in the African media landscape, we feel honoured to be part of this summit. Positive African narrative is at the core of our business and we will always endeavor to make sure that we are part of the voice for the positive transformation and development of the continent," noted Eloine Barry, African Media Agency's founder and CEO.  While previous editions of the summit have attracted over 250 leaders from across Africa, United States and the United Kingdom, the 2019 edition promises to be even bigger.
