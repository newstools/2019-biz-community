The campaign theme, founded on insights around the power of sharing, needed to be communicated in a clear and meaningful way across multiple touchpoints, including TV, radio, digital including a microsite, and other supporting collateral, as well as through an internal campaign.Riverbed partnered with Director Kit at Darling Films to produce a high-end, rich and textured production of the 40” TVC entitled, "Fierce Girl", as well as online film. The spot introduced the audience to an ambitious, adaptable and spirited young girl who doesn’t let anything stand in her way. The simple, warm and emotional piece reveals her motive, which is to share the income she’s earned with the people she cares about in her community. Ultimately, this idea reveals the sentiment of the share scheme, which poses the question, "What’s the point of aiming higher, if not to share the rewards?" Bridget Johnson, agency ECD commented, “Oftentimes B-BBEE content is cold and business-like, and so our purpose was to bring heart and the intention of Barloworld Khula Sizwe to life, through an uncomplicated narrative about the significance of sharing and inspiring a world of difference.”Agency CEO and founder, Monalisa Sibongile Zwambila added, “There’s an affinity between Riverbed and Barloworld’s greater good values and embracing diversity. This type of work resonates with our business culture and we’re delighted to have partnered with them on this project.” “What’s more,” she added, “We’ve recently been appointed as the agency of record for Barloworld Equipment. The business was looking for an agency that could bring more innovative creative solutions to the team, following a global easing up of strict and conservative marketing policies. This opening up of flexibility in creative scope afforded us the opportunity to present an ideas-led approach that would help challenge the brand’s creative threshold, and move them into a more innovative space.”
