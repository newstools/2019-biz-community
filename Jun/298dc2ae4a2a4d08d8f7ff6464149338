To help English-speaking South Africans enjoy Afrikaans content, a compromise needed to be reached. This was done through four deceivingly clever print ads in one of the most-read weekly magazines in South Africa: You Magazine.These print ads were written in English, but when read out loud pronounce as perfect Afrikaans â€“ proving to 6 million South Africans that even if your mother tongue is English, you can still enjoy the best in Afrikaans entertainment.Karen Meiring, M-Net: Director kykNET Channels, comments: "This campaign encompasses the playfulness of our brand and transcends the boundaries of language. It gave us the opportunity to speak to our English viewers while grabbing the attention of a new audience."
