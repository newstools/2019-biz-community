In a recent publication by Accenture it is stated that “customers aren’t just making decisions based on the stalwarts of product selection or price. They’re now assessing what a brand says. What it does. What it stands for.” They aren’t chasing quantity but quality. They are seeking authenticity and relevance. They want to feel as though they are a part of something bigger. They are driven to connect, to grow, to make a difference. They are buying on belief.The opportunity therefore lies in the recognition of the power of humanity to drive business and consequently build more authentic relationships with customers. When the heart of the brand narrative becomes a cause that customers want to support it creates a new tone to brand communications that captures potential customers and turns them into passionate brand ambassadors. Purpose-driven marketing sets brands apart from each other and lets consumers know that the organisation isn’t just in it to make money.Beginning with a purpose that serves a genuine need is key. This purpose should then be embodied in every aspect of the organisation and communications at every level of the business should reflect the brand mission.Join the debate around future-proofing marketing as guests celebrate, learn and connect.
