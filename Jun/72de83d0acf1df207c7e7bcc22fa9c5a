How has the initiative grown since we last chatted?Blackboard has become a well-oiled machine. Thanks to the support from Nina and Lourens van Rensburg of 7Films, we now have a dedicated team of people who ensure the operation runs smoothly, freeing me up to focus on the overall vision of the initiative. The workshops are also more frequent, which has helped strengthen our ties with the students. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Share a few important milestones you’ve reached thus far, in your goal to expose advertising as a career to high school students and this hopefully diversifying the talent pool of the future. In the last two years, we’ve exposed over 60 under-privileged high school students to a variety of career opportunities in the advertising and film production industries. These are kids who had never heard of advertising before, but now understand disciplines such as art direction, post-production, copywriting and others. It’s an important step as the youth continue their fight for equality.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/492303-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: Don't forget age and experience as a diversity and inclusion factor" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Don't forget age and experience as a diversity and inclusion factorThe industry's lack of diversity and inclusion was made notably clear by last year's #TimesUp movement, largely focused on equality in race and gender. Now, with a rise of 'diversity and inclusion' focused roles popping in advertising, here's why it's important to focus on a range of ages and experience levels for true business transformation...By Leigh Andrews 15 Apr 2019The next step will be to handpick the most passionate bunch and guide them into the industry once they complete high school. It’s a long game, but I believe this is what real transformation means. It’s not just tweaking the optics in a boardroom or quickly trying to hire people of colour when you’re going to pitch for business. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/492028-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Bookmarks2019: Transformation isn't just about your scorecard or employing more black people" width="120" height="120">#Bookmarks2019: Transformation isn't just about your scorecard or employing more black peopleHaving won the same award in 2017, Nomacala Mpeta, head of learning at Digify Africa, explains why they're proud to be recognised a second time for leading the push for transformation in digital and encourages more agencies and NGOs to recognise the need to do so as a business imperative in corporate SA...By Jessica Tennant 11 Apr 2019Real transformation is putting plans in place to make sure we’re not talking about the same issue in 10 years..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Hear, hear! Why is it so important to draw parallels between the students of 1976 and 2019? The progress of this country has always depended on the youth. In 1976, students took to the streets and helped shape the South Africa we’re living in today. In 2019, we’re still leaning on students to move us forward. Except this time, they are going to need a different tool to shape our future. And that tool is creativity..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Explain creativity as the most powerful tool for change in 2019 and beyond. Creativity is a powerful business weapon, which helps create opportunities where they didn’t exist. So from an economic point of view, it’s one of our greatest assets. It’s also the most effective way to tackle social issues such as health, education and safety. As Einstein said, “Imagination is more important than knowledge, for knowledge is limited”..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Let’s end with an overview of some of the NPO projects the grade 10 students are working on leading up to Youth Day, in terms of using creativity to shape a new future of SA. This year, we’re taking our momentum further. Starting from 1 June, the month that represents the youth and their fight for equality, the students have the opportunity to create real work for a non-profit client, with the help of our friends in the industry.This way, the students can get practical experience and discover the joy of solving problems through creativity. And that tool is creativity.We’re currently working on both Operation Smile and the Chaeli Campaign. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1511/321114.jpg" alt="[21 Icons Season 3] Michaela Mycroft" width="120" height="120"> Michaela MycroftMycroft has been selected for 21 Icons South Africa Season 3 as an individual who exemplifies an inspiration to all South Africans.

The beauty of it is that you have high school children using their creativity to help other children. In return, the Blackboard students learn how to solve problems through creativity in the process. It’s a kids-helping-kids cycle. That’s truly creativity that matters.
