Also, client meetings will become a grand affair in the ultra-modern Client Experience Centre. The office, which will be the base of operations for over 600 Kantar and GroupM employees, was designed to ignite inspiration. An urban jungle with a dash of futuristic charm. From the Funko POP wall to the graffiti mural, there is something for everyone at The Base. On a more strategic level, The Base has been designed to enable smarter client solutions through cross-collaboration between GroupM agencies, Kantar and the rest of WPP. Sitting in one space further reinforces this ambition and we aim to continue to deliver high standards of work across the group.Home of artistic expression“This is the first step towards building a WPP Campus in South Africa, as our group is launching in many countries around the world, where all disciplines come together to offer a new integrated service to our clients.”GroupM has also established a similar office in Black River Park, Cape Town.
