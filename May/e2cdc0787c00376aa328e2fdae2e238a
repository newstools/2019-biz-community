Along with the familiar blood-curdling battles between leopards, lions, hyenas and wild dogs, we meet new characters like cheetahs, jackals and baboons. They may once have been reviled, pitied, hated or seen as the cruelest of enemies, but in each new episode everything can change. The only law is the law of survival. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/499280-625x351.jpg" alt="Savage Kingdom 3 premieres Sunday 2 June 6pm on National Geographic Wild" width="625" height="351">Dawn of Darkness (ep 1): Led by a ruthless Commander, the rotten clan of hyenas seizes power from the lions.
