We are also close to a large number of merchants and small businesses, and we understand the daily struggles they face.“Yoco is in a fairly unique position, in that we have access to vaults of information that could mean the difference between small business success or failure.”Using direct feedback from almost 4,000 small business owners, who participated in a survey and highlighted their pain points, challenges, and “things they wish they had known”, Yoco has built a course focusing on the fundamentals of starting a new business. The course is interactive and provides both knowledge and encouragement to would-be and established entrepreneurs.Additionally, it is hosting three #JustStart events in Polokwane, Pretoria, and Bloemfontein (research suggests these regions do not have enough startup support), and has compiled a research-based white paper for small business owners, from small business owners.By establishing a strong network, which includes both expert advice and peer learning, Yoco is providing individuals with the tools and support needed to achieve the best possible outcomes.
