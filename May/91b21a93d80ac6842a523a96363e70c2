Knowing their personal values align with the company values should be covered in the interview stage, so once they’re part of the team, we need to make it clear that we want to work with people who bring their own special spark to the table. The LinkedIn Talent blog says to encourage them to be themselves and to bring their whole selves to work.HR Zone says office rapport is a big part of adding to the sense of belongingness – it helps to establish mutual connections with your colleagues. Make the effort to find some common ground and soon you’ll be A for away.The LinkedIn Talent blog adds that you need to go beyond an ‘Employee of the Month’ as all employees want to be recognised not just for showing up, but for offering something unique to the organisation. You can do so by assigning projects that stress the value of those individual strengths to the company. Go so far as to say, “We’d like you on this project as your unique skills will see it grow.”Doing so is a good starting point to enhance the sense of belonging among your employees, which in turn will encourage them to grow their roots as a loyal team member, and part of a happy team.
