This is the type of advertising that advertisers take out – on either search engines (such as Google)  or social media channels (such as Facebook) – that directs traffic to a company’s website. “This type of advertising is exceptionally useful when you’re trying to promote a new website,” says Lisa Schneider: Managing Director of the Digital School of Marketing. “This is because you are paying a fee to get people to visit your website while you are building up organic traffic.”What is Google PPC?Google – as well as other search engines – allows advertisers to bid for advertisement placements in their sponsored links. You’ll see these at the top of organic listings as these are marked with the label “ad”.Every time that a user inputs search terms that correspond with a particular ad group, the advertisements that Google chooses to display is based on the particular advertiser’s AdRank. This score is calculated based on: How much money the advertiser is willing to pay per click through to their website, which is multiplied by, The advertiser’s quality score that is determined by the company’s click-through rate, the relevance and the landing page quality.“In order to determine if you’re getting a good return on investment (ROI) for your Google advertising spend, you need to benchmark yourself against the particular industry that you’re playing in,” says Schneider. “However, on average, the click through rate is sitting at 2%.”What is Facebook PPC?Facebook offers a great variety of formats that advertisers can choose to have their adverts in. This is, as opposed to Google, which limits their offerings to a handful of options.Although the highest click through rate that Facebook reports is at 1.61% (this is for legal practitioners), in 2018 the company reported their fourth quarter advertising revenue to be US$16.6bn. (In today’s exchange rate terms, this comes in at around R235.9m.) Other high click-through rates came from industries such as: Retail: 1.59% Apparel: 1.24% Beauty: 1.16% Fitness: 1.01%So given that so many people are going for Facebook Ads, even though their click-through rates are lower than Google Ads’, does this mean that you should be going for this solution and ditching your Google Ad spend? “We don’t recommend this,” concludes Schneider. “It’s never a good idea to put all of your eggs in one basket because if, for example, you do decide to only go with Facebook Ads you may be wasting your budget on a solution that isn’t right for your company. Especially when you’re starting out, rather divide your budget so that you spend equal amounts on Google and Facebook Advertising so that you can see – from the results that you get – which platform brings in the highest ROI for your business.PPC is a necessary tool for any digital marketer to have as it supports your website being noticed by the people that you want to - in other words, your customers.
