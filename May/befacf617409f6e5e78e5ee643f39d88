Working alongside Egg producer Saskia Rosenberg Haak, Ogilvy creatives Terry McKenna, Sue Jenner, Hazel Davies, and DOP Fabian Vettiger, Radebe has delivered authentic textures, effortless visual aesthetic and a complimentary ensemble cast.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497184.jpg" alt="Egg Films' and One Show awardee creates nostalgic new TVC for Cadbury" width="600" height="600">“Zwelethu’s filmmaking is defined by an empathy for his characters and a genuine interest in what they experience, so naturally a lot of the really important work happens during casting,” adds Rosenberg Haak. “In this piece, we enjoy three beautifully juxtaposed characters for a brief moment. Enormous in their subtlety - the performances are understated and nuanced.”This is one of the sweetest ads of the year. Watch it now, then go phone your mom!
