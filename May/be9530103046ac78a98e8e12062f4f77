<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497421-625x308.jpg" alt="Developing a mobile strategy" width="625" height="308">Understand your target audience: prepare a profile of your target audience to better understand them in terms of their demographics, as well as other factors such as where they are located and when they are likely to receive the advertisement or another promotional message. This will ensure that any campaign that you develop matches the profile of the intended target audience clearly. Mobile must link up with other strategies: you need to sit down and work through your e-marketing and marketing strategies, ensuring that each part of your proposed mobile strategy makes sense in light of the other strategies. This is a deliberate task that needs to be undertaken. Itâ€™s still about the message: create a positive attitude in the mind of the customer! You need to ensure to give important content, You need to ensure that it is in context with what the customer is currently viewing, that it creates a positive attitude in the minds if consumers, results in action and is measurable. Keep it simple: do not try to complicate your strategy always keep it simple. The mobile message should encourage users to tap through to a full-screen advertisement optimised for mobile which contains a clear call to action. Keeping it simple also means having a clear (documented) goal of what you hope to achieve. SMS is still the king: SMSs still remains to be the king of communication. The audience can get information about special deals about products and services. Give the customer something: the online world is a give-and-take world. Good examples would be a short, fun game or the other practical app that users can use in their everyday lives, music that the customer can download, a discount voucher, an industry report or other inside information. Full-screen is better than banner: the more screen space means more space in which to convince the customer and to include media options such as videos, animations, pictures, graphics and explanatory text. It also reduces the false clicks that banner advertisements sometimes elicit. Do not irritate the customer: do not create mobile advertisements that do not give the user a way out. This will just annoy most users and drive them away rather than turning them into customers. Make your advertisements contextual: it is important to ensure that the advertisements flighted are in context with the site or content that the user is viewing. If there is a close match between the content being viewed and the advertisement being flighted, the chances of the user clicking through are much higher. Use rich media: the mobile world is a dynamic world built on rich media technologies. For this reason, banner advertisements using rich media are likely to outperform purely static advertisements. Find ways to integrate mobile with email: ensure that the email text contains a call to action to click on the link question. Many mobile users use their mobile phones to catch up with email during the otherwise unproductive time. For this reason, your email campaign should be tightly integrated with your mobile campaign, making it easy for a potential customer that has received an email marketing message to learn more using his/her mobile device. Ensure that there is a link in the email the message that will take the reader to a mobile landing page so that the reader can get more information. www.voocmediagroup.com
