While Kim and Ron have always been one step ahead of their opponents, navigating the social hierarchy of high school is more challenging than the action-hero ever imagined. With Drakken and Shego lurking in the wings, Kim must rely on her family and friends more than ever. Now it's up to Team Possible—Kim, Ron, tech-genius Wade, new friend Athena and Rufus, a Naked mole-rat that Ron meets along the way—to stop these super villains.Viewers' connection to "Kim Possible" also led to an off-TV franchise, including Kim Possible and Ron Stoppable characters at Disney Parks & Resorts and a line of "Kim Possible" branded consumer products at mass retail, soundtracks, books and games.Be sure to catch the premier of "Kim Possible" on Disney Channel, DStv channel 303 on Friday, 3 May, at 16h00 with repeats on Saturday, 4 May, at 06h55 and 10h40, Sunday, 5 May, at 14h00 and Friday, 24 May, at 16h00.
