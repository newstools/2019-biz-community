<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496175.jpg" alt="Pernod Ricard calls on Publicis Machine to shake things up in the Scotch whisky category" width="263" height="500">"Our motivation behind the decision comes down to the successful partnership we’ve forged with the agency," says Sibu Shangase, Head of Marketing for Pernod Ricard SA’s Whisky Portfolio. "Publicis Machine has managed two of our premium liquor brands since 2015 – The Glenlivet Whisky and Martell Cognac, and has demonstrated a strong commitment to our business, that has led to  some groundbreaking work on both brands. "The team has proven that it has the ability to grow and elevate the business of global brand houses like Pernod Ricard, in local markets, and it just made sense to entrust a brand like Chivas to this team.  We think it’s a smart move, especially at this time when we want to make a few disruptive changes, to encourage whisky fans to enjoy their favourite spirit in a whole new way." Chivas is an iconic brand – both locally and globally – and is the world’s first luxury whisky. Its tagline, "Success is a blend", underscores the reputation of the Chivas House for expert blending, overseen by Master Blender Colin Scott.  It’s considered to be a timeless classic, renowned for its benchmark quality and taste, style, substance and exclusivity. A truly global brand, Chivas Regal has been integral to the growth of the Scotch whisky category worldwide and today sells 4.5 million cases annually in more than 150 countries across the globe. https://www.chivas.com/en-ZA "It’s an honour to be entrusted with the reputation and growth of this iconic whisky brand by one of our most valued clients," says MD and CCO for Publicis Machine, Gareth McPherson. "There is a strong cultural synergy between our businesses, and, with a solid partnership already formed, we anticipate the creation of excellent work.  Our mandate is to elevate this well-established brand within the premium whisky market in South Africa, and we will do this with consistent brand messaging, through an integrated communications approach.  From experience, we know that this is key to growing volume." Born from Digital, the agency has carved a unique position within the industry over the years, and the team’s ability to provide creative solutions that ingrain its client’s brands into popular culture is key to its success. McPherson reiterates: "Our agency has always been built on creativity. We employ creative thinking at every level, solving brand problems with unique solutions that work, and with an intent of them working well." That, and the agency’s creative organisation, an organic collection of specialists housed in pillars – content marketing, public relations, through-the-line communications, technology & digital solutions and user-experience - has been instrumental in positioning Publicis Machine as one of the country’s leading brand experience agencies. "This win is a real vote of confidence in our team, and we’re looking forward to creating magic for Chivas Regal, alongside the team at Pernod Ricard," concludes McPherson.
