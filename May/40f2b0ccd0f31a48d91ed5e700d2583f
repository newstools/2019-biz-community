Through it you build relationships, your confidence to sell your project, and most of all the insight of industry professionals with years of experience with projects from around the world,” said Nick Wilson, head of projects and content at AAN.MentorshipBaché said she was looking forward to working with more amazing African animation talent.“The last three years of having partnered with AAN to host Animation du Monde Pan-Africa have been really exciting for us at MIFA,” explained Baché. “We have been able to identify and mentor talents that we would ordinarily have never had access to. “And this is really at the crux of what we are intending to do with Animation du Monde; firstly, and very importantly, skills development as many of the contestants have never had any formal training but are extremely talented and passionate and, secondly, for the top talents, to give them access to the global animation industry during the MIFA Pitches.”Creative AfricaWilfrid Paré, general coordinator of the Association Burkinabè du Cinéma d'Animation (ABCA), describes his Animation du Monde experience: “Initiating ABCA’s partnership with AAN in 2017, was one of the most beautiful things that happened to me professionally. I have seen Africa express itself in its diversity and beauty through enthusiastic and creative young people who proudly carry their uniqueness. Uniqueness that they try to communicate to the world at the DISCOP Markets and ultimately, if they are successful, at Annecy.“The regional and continental phases of Animation du Monde, which I took part in, accelerated my skills development. I met people that are convinced that it is possible to tell beautiful stories on the continent. It moved me and made me aware that another Africa is possible, a CREATIVE Africa.”Animation du Monde’s mission is to give animation projects in developing animation industries from across the world the opportunity to participate at the highest level internationally during the MIFA Pitches. The MIFA Pitches are arguably the biggest animation focused pitching forum in the world and take place against the backdrop of the Annecy Int. Animated Film Fest’ & Market/MIFA (Annecy/MIFA).DevelopmentAfrica’s animation industry is still developing. In recognition of the challenges that creators face in being able to reach a market there is a strong focus on animated short film and series this year. These formats have created opportunities in the past for African producers to forge continental and international partnerships to produce their content.The variety of stories that exist in Africa is a testament to the diversity of its more than 1.2 billion people. Animation du Monde is creating a platform for the world to learn more about this population. The most widely spoken languages across the continent might be English, French, Arabic, and Portugese, but story is creating a new means to understand who we are as Africans. Something our two African finalists, Nildo Essa (Mozambique) and Dami Solesi (Nigeria) hope to achieve at the Animation du Monde MIFA pitches finale taking place at the Annecy/MIFA 2019.DISCOP Abidjan is the second of five preliminary rounds of the Pan-African Animation du Monde 2020. Through the DISCOMICS footprint– an initiative run by DISCOP Markets and AAN – and which includes partnerships with three of Africa’s longest running comic conventions, AAN will be hosting four regional prelims in Johannesburg (at ICON CGC), Abidjan (at DISCOP Abidjan), Lagos (at Lagos Comic Con), and Nairobi (at Nairobi Comic Con).  Because, the partners are always looking to create new opportunities for creators across Africa, AAN has partnered with the Accra Animation Film Festival (AAFFia) to add a 5th regional prelim.At the Continental Finals held at DISCOP Johannesburg 2018, all the finalists got to work on their projects with industry heavy hitters who were both judges and mentors. These included names like Alexis Ducord and Arthur de Pins, co-directors of Zombillenium; Mike de Seve, creative director at Baboon Animation; Rathan Sam George, COO of Toonz Media Group); and Géraldine Baché head of projects at MIFA. As part of the Annecy – MIFA Animation du Monde – Skills Programme, a programme of workshops, masterclasses, one-on-one project evaluations and pitch practice sessions were run at DISCOP Johannesburg ahead of the continental final. Participants were given valuable insights into both improving their projects and their pitching techniques.Contestants have until the 17th of May to submit their project and can do so by clicking HERE. Video pitches will be accepted for those not able to attend the preliminary regional round at DISCOP Abidjan however, candidates who are able to attend the event will be given preference. The competition regulations can be viewed HERE.
