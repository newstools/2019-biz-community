Amidst all the milestones and successes, Decimal Agency and Ster-Kinekor have proven that they are as compatible popcorn and a movie, hence the extension. “We are pleased to continue the working relationship with Decimal and look forward to a continued innovative approach to our business,” says Lynne Wylie, Head of Marketing of Ster-Kinekor Theatres. “The ethos of our team has always been to go above and beyond for our clients, and that has always been reflected in our work,” said Raffaele McCreadie, Managing Director at Decimal Agency. “We look forward to continue to create innovative ways in making every movie experience the greatest,” McCreadie added. Decimal Agency will continue to drive all digital communication across Ster-Kinekor’s social media channels, design as well as animation.
