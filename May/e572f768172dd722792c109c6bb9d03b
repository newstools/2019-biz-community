The Awards recognise excellence in specialist creative fields and form part of the annual Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity, a five-day event that sets global benchmarks in the marketing and brand communications arena.Being chosen to judge the best work on the planet is an acknowledgement of a creative’s own standing in their industry. It’s also a serious feather in the cap of the professional concerned, as well as their agency and the South African creative sector at large. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495902.jpg" alt="Ryan McManus, Neo Mashigo, Fran Luckin, Nikki Taylor, Claudi Potter, Michael Zylstra and Tseliso Rangaka." width="625" height="417">Ryan McManus, Neo Mashigo, Fran Luckin, Nikki Taylor, Claudi Potter, Michael Zylstra and Tseliso Rangaka.Ster-Kinekor Sales, the official Cannes Lions representative in South Africa, has announced the list of the South African creatives to receive the honour this year.
