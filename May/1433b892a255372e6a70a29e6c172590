The results of both pieces really underline the importance of connecting with your audience on an emotional level,” he concluded. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/498476-625x351.jpg" alt="HelloFCB+ and Netflorist say it with a Pencil" width="625" height="351">Credits:CCO Mike BarnwellECD Camilla ClerkeDesigner Matt Crisp
