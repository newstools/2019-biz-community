The day was intended as one of learning, growing and being more empowered to make better choices when reporting on children.The core focus of the day was to challenge us all to think differently and see the world differently while finding the courage to tell those hard stories.Accurately reflecting children's lives in the mediaHinton said to think of the filters we apply as adults - from where we live to our past experiences - and how that changes the way we see the world. Our reality isn't necessarily the only reality.She shared the following video as encouragement:Hinton shared that children make up around 35% of the South African population. Legally, she said while there’s evolving capacity the older you get, you’re considered a child until the day you turn 18. Despite this, coverage of children’s issues tends to be minimal. Children are not on the agenda yet they should be, as the future of the country.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475452-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Leigh Andrews, editor-in-chief of marketing and media at Bizcommunity." width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: Youth marketing techniques to target the real SA youth marketWe often have to look back at the path we've travelled in order to see the road ahead more clearly. Here's what I've learned about youth marketing over the past few months and what I predict we'll see in 2019...By Leigh Andrews 10 Jan 2019Further explaining the importance of reporting on children, Hinton said the media should be creating news for and about them, not just in the extremes of the talented few who perform amazing feats or their polar opposites.The media doesn’t tell us what to think, it tells us what to think about. In your own agenda setting, of telling readers what to think about, do children feature?Before you get started, there are factors to consider of both law and ethics around reporting on children and interviewing them. Start with a refresher on the law as you don’t see the foundations when building a house, but without them, the house falls down.Colouring in the story around black-and-white law, grey ethicsThat’s why the law is the starting point, the black and white of what to do. For example, you can’t disclose the name of a child offender under the age of 18. Ethics is built on top of the law, as something to weigh up and practice every day on a personal level.That’s the starting point of good journalism. You won’t even get out of the starting block if the law says ‘no’. But Hinton says the challenges aren’t in the easy questions but in the grey areas. 'When reporting on children, report the truth as fully as possible, but minimize the potential harm on the child' - Taryn Hinton @MediaMattersZA @CIatUCT pic.twitter.com/NP7i1tjOwF— Voice of the Cape (@VOCfm) May 22, 2019This does get better with practice but remember it's a personal process. While applied individually that ethica debate needs to be supported collectively, as the coverage will include your byline but needs buy-in and understanding from your team. Balancing public interest with rights of the childThere are two important aspects to keep in mind when it comes to appearance in court and criminal cases.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1706/398743.jpg" alt="New ruling puts court trials in the spotlight" width="120" height="120">New ruling puts court trials in the spotlightOn 21 June 2017, the Supreme Court of Appeal handed down a judgment allowing video recording of a trial. This is seen as a victory for media freedom and open justice...By Dario Milo and Lavanya Pillay 26 Jun 2017The first is the presence of the media, while the second is about the publication of information around the case.That’s often where we get tripped up. There are clear definitions for underage witnesses and perpetrators, not so much for the victim. Usually, you can tell the story, as long as you don’t directly or indirectly identify the victim or the perpetrator if they are under the age of 18.Hinton says that not identifying the child often means not identifying the parents or school if you can help it.The blurred ethics of social mediaBut what happens with a developing story, where the child turns 18 during or after the trial? As media, you’re the gatekeeper, so best ethical practice is to still protect them.This becomes all the more tricky on social media, and online media comment sections are a free-for-all as the average citizen journalist doesn’t live to those standards of ethical journalism.In balancing what’s in the public interest against the rights of the child. Hinton cautions against sensationalism and says to focus on whether sharing certain details are in the interests of the public, or whether it’s actually of public interest. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497965-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Suffer the children: media 'guilty of child negligence'" width="120" height="120">Suffer the children: media 'guilty of child negligence'Despite the Media Monitoring Africa's latest report showing an increase in children reporting, their voices are still missing in the newspapers...27 Aug 2010When it comes to an underage survivor wanting to tell their story once criminal proceedings are over it’s their choice to do so, as they have the right to freedom of expression, especially with parental consent or that of a guardian.But it still remains an ethical issue of informed consent on the media. You need to make it clear how many people will see or hear the story and the potential impact thereof.Hinton concluded the section with a reminder that every journalist is a human, which is why we’re so touched by human stories.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/456697-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image © Daniel Ernst via ." width="120" height="120">#YouthReport2018: Being a teenager in 2018, more pressure than peer pressureThe fourth session of the UCT Unilever Institute of Strategic Marketing's Youth Report 2018 release,  also presented by Martin Neethling, director of groceries at Pioneer Foods, shared insight into the pressures SA's youth are really under - there's more to it than just 'being a teenager'...By Leigh Andrews 10 Sep 2018The best help you can give someone, no matter their age or circumstance, is to tell their story in the best possible way.It’s on us as journalists to uphold the standards in an era where everyone can publish their thoughts to social media.I’ll be covering further aspects covered in the workshop over my next few #FairnessFirst articles.
