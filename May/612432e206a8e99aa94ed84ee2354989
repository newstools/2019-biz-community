In packaging and flavour notes, it takes some cues from the category in order to win credibility whilst breaking some conventions and retaining a sense of uniqueness. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495269.jpg?2" alt="Designing Bain's international passport to status" width="500" height="251" rel="">click to enlargeThe design for the new 15 Year Old Founder’s Collection honours two incredible innovators integrally connected with the brand: engineer and roadbuilder, AG Bain, who built the incredible pass above the distillery; and maverick master distiller, A Watts, who conceived and created this incredible 100% grain whisky. The label takes its cue from the core variant, embellished with beautiful finishes, and a gift box was added with a visual depiction of the iconic Bain’s Kloof Pass to complete the sense of storytelling and specialness. The 15 Year Old is a true grain whisky that follows the distinctive Bain’s five-year process, before being further aged in American Oak barrels for an even more sophisticated palette and sublime smoothness. Launched in February 2019, it is available at R800 exclusively from Duty Free. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495270.jpg?1" alt="Designing Bain's international passport to status" width="500" height="333">About Bain’s Cape Mountain Whisky Bain’s core offering is a five-year old.
