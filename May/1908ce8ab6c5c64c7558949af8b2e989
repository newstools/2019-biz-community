The goal of the campaign was to get consumers to submit their unique underliner codes, but with an entry mechanic that was interactive and could provide instant rewards and an entry in the Grand Prize Draw to win ten double tickets to the Heineken UCL Cup Final.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495153.gif" alt="Facebook chatbot world first for Heineken South Africa" width="620" height="823">Techsys Digital built the chatbot on the Facebook Messenger App, since the platform is so popular and chatbot campaigns in the space are very rare and typically not very sophisticated. Techsys MD Andrew Walmsley explains that, “The Messenger App engages with consumers at scale without any human involvement using artificial intelligence, and answers queries around the campaign mechanics, prizes, and how to enter.”  Consumers could toggle between the chatbot and a livechat with a customer service agent should they wish to.The beauty of the campaign was that every week the Artificial Intelligence that monitored the conversation between the chatbot and the consumer became more intuitive.  This ultimately improved the customer experience to create increasingly more seamless engagements with the bot.“Each week the number of consumers and the amount of entries grew considerably, indicating how happy consumers are with the channel as a means to engage with the brand,” says Walmsley.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495150-625x151.png" alt="Facebook chatbot world first for Heineken South Africa" width="625" height="151">Want to partner with Techsys on a project?
