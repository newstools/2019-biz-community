For Wimpy, we created kid-friendly Touch Play Tables that are installed within the play areas to keep their younger customers entertained. Whereas at Steers, we implemented a four-screen solution where the two middle screen sync, to the nanosecond using System-on-Chip (SOC) capabilities, to draw attention to specific promotions or new products being launched”.Famous Brands refresh their digital signage networks every five years to remain technologically relevant and to ensure that the digital signage supports and complies with their brands’ refreshed in-restaurant layouts and design. “In the past six months, we have completed 141 installations for Famous Brands. We have completed close to 100 installations for Steers and Wimpy alone and we’re always planning new installation as their brands expand,” explains Bierman.Adolf Fourie, Marketing Executive at Steers, says “We are rolling out digital menu boards as it provides us with a lot more flexibility across our nearly 600 restaurants - to be agile and target our consumers with different messaging at different times of the day. It also allows for speed to market and flexibility at each restaurant that traditional static menu boards will never offer. We are excited by the impact these digital menu boards are making in our restaurants in driving sales and feet for our business”. Digital signage is the leading way that QSR and retail businesses are engaging with their customers and promoting their brand. A digital screen solution enables brands to regionalise their campaigns, ensure that all outlets adhere to the corporate identity guidelines, promote products via day-parting or unique content, and upsell. “Digital content is easy and very quick to update without having any human interaction at store level and the screens can also be used for staff training and other company communication. Its multifaceted benefits are the reason why digital signage has become the way to communicate within QSR and retail environments,” adds Bierman.
