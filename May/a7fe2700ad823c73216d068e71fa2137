That connection, however, is hard to earn, but that is where the magic lies – finding those nuggets that get you the nod.6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. The latter says it all. An “average workday” is a thing of fiction. Every day starts with a purpose and an agenda. I get to work early, at 6:30am, to give myself a head start. I find that mornings are a great time to reflect and give myself pep talks to “be great,” as Brian Shaw always says. I start off with my pick-me-up jam, “Superwoman” – Alicia Keys. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1805/440869-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Fernando Machado, head of brand marketing of Burger King. © ." width="120" height="120">#OneShow2018: SA EXCLUSIVE with Burger King!In an exclusive interview, Ann Nurock talks to Fernando Machado, head of brand marketing for Burger King.

One such project was the roll out of the Burger King South Africa App.15. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? Baby pics and vids of my nieces, nephews and friends’ babies. I love babies! Memes, loads and loads of memes and hilarious WhatsApp chats.16. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry?Be curious. Ask many questions. Chat to everyone, you never know what wisdom or opportunities you could gain. Always remain teachable. Go the extra-mile, give more than what is expected of you. Action with passion. If you don’t love or enjoy what you do, it’s time to move on. Always seek feedback as that’ll allow you to better yourself.Simple as that.
