With a keen eye for design and over 20 years of working in the London design industry, Thielen co-founded Together Design in 2003, an agency built on craft and collaboration, which has blossomed into an enviable work culture.

She’s passionate about consumer brands and retail, and loves the challenge of developing emotional connections and crafting personality, having worked on brand and packaging designs and licensing guides for Walgreens Boots Alliance, Diageo, NBC Universal, University of Cambridge, Caffè Nero, Fortnum & Mason and many stamp collections for the Royal Mail.          View this post on Instagram           Starting the new year as we mean to go on; hand painting and sketching ideas for a new project.

I chatted to her about her judging expectations, what we can expect from her DStv Seminar of Creativity talk and more….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}It’s always an honour to be asked to judge international work, especially as an international jury president for the Loeries. How did you celebrate the news and what does this mean to you, personally?Judging awards is always an honour, as well as being an opportunity for lively debate and discussion with like-minded creatives and designers from around the world.  So I was delighted to be asked and I celebrated with the rest of the Together team in our time-honoured fashion – with a bottle of bubbly from my father's vineyard in Germany! .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Lovely! What are you most looking forward to from Loeries Creative Week 2019? I’ve been to Africa a few times before, but this will be my first time in South Africa and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the country and learning more about the creative industry in the region. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/494893-120x120.png?2" alt="Loeries CEO Andrew Human encourages everyone to tell better stories." width="120" height="120">#AfricaMonth: Advertising's shift beyond 'selling stuff' to tell better regional storiesIn our annual #AfricaMonth catch-up, Loeries CEO Andrew Human chats about what to expect from Loeries 2019, why judges are briefed to look for locally relevant experiences and communications, and the rising importance of brand humanity and problem-solving in creativity against the continued shift away from merely punting the client product or service...By Leigh Andrews 3 May 2019<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/493957-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Some of team Mama Creative, from L to R: Kyle Gounden, Karla Strydom, Mishka Naidoo, Nicola Rossi, Adam Leontsinis, and Tetelo Nhlapo." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: Mama Creative explains why it's on all of us to tell better storiesYou've probably already noticed this year's striking Loeries campaign in your social media feeds and daily industry reads.

Here's how Mama Creative hopes Loeries 2019 will inspire us all to tell better stories...By Leigh Andrews 26 Apr 2019I'm looking forward to discovering more about the creative essence of your region during the judging process. It's always fascinating to discover how different cultures are reflected through their creativity and ideas – it's a window into another world..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}The jury presidents also speak at the DStv Seminar of Creativity, a highlight for many attendees. What can we expect from your session? My presentation will bring together a few strands that are important to us at Together: the maturity and interconnected nature of the UK's design community; the way the traditional boundaries between advertising, branding and graphic design have dissolved; and how as the founder of a relatively small design company, we instil a workplace culture in which great ideas thrive, enabling us to compete creatively and strategically with much larger global players.

Today's consumers are very demanding and they look for brands that reflect their own values and priorities.The penny has finally dropped for many big brands, who are now realising that rather than merely paying lip service to corporate social responsibility, having a coherent sense of brand 'purpose' can have a huge influence on their revenues. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/486988-120x120.jpg?2" alt="YPO member James Barty - also ACA chairperson and CEO of King James Group." width="120" height="120">#YPOEdge: James Barty on brand humanity and doing good business, beyond ticking the 'CSI box'Leigh Andrews speaks to King James founder and YPO member James Barty about what he gains from his involvement in YPO and how all businesses can make a better impact...By Leigh Andrews 14 Mar 2019So I think the way that brands are now seeking to develop and express their purpose is a fascinating evolution that's currently taking place across branding and advertising..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}With so much advertising ‘noise’ out there, it takes a lot to stand out from the crowd. What will you be looking for in this year’s entries? A great idea, of course – that's still essential! Millennials are the most informed and connected generation we've ever seen, so successful advertising needs to appeal to their values. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1712/423519-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Leigh Andrews, editor-in-chief of marketing and media at Bizcommunity." width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2018: Rewind from attention spam back to attention spanOne of the biggest trends we're set to see this year is a plethora of marketing messages facing ever-decreasing attention from consumers. Take note of the clever planning required for yours to stand out from the snowballing amount of spam...By Leigh Andrews 8 Jan 2018At the same time, this audience also has a notoriously short attention span, so a standout idea needs to have an immediacy that will make people want to share it on social media, hugely increasing its reach and impact.   That’s the power of a great idea. If you get cracking, you can still submit your great ideas as entries for Loeries 2019, provided they’ve already flighted, as the extended deadline is 31 May. If you can’t wait for Loeries Creative Week Durban, taking place from 14 to 20 August 2019, keep an eye on the Loeries’ Twitter, Facebook and Instagram feeds and stay tuned for my interviews with more of the international jury presidents and all the latest updates in our Loeries’ special section.
