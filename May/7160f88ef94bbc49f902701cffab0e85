Others are simply honouring Mabuza’s nickname (as if we need an excuse to post cat memes.)But what are the ramifications?Speculation on his, and President Ramaphosa’s future, is rife. Some believe the ANC will push Ramaphosa aside allowing Mabuza to take the highest position in the country. Some are already labelling Mabuza as South Africa’s “2024 President”.That said, Mabuza’s future as deputy president isn’t set in stone. President Ramaphosa has yet to announce his cabinet or his second-in-command. Either way, it’s likely you’ll see a lot more cat memes mixed in with South Africa’s politics going forward.
