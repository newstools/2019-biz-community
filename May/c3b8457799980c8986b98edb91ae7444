View this post on Instagram           Tara Mckenty is our Digital Communication Jury President for 2019. She’s won over 100 awards during her advertising rebellion. Tara brings an exciting wealth of talent to this year’s judging panel. Visit our link in bio for her full profile. Extended deadline is 31 May. #Loeries2019 #LoeriesTellBetterStories A post shared by  The Loeries (@loerieawards) on May 14, 2019 at 5:00am PDT  When McKenty was four, her kindergarten teacher told her mother that she would either grow up to be the Prime Minister of New Zealand, or the devil itself. After casting a career in politics aside, and realising red wasn’t her colour, McKenty’s stepped into the wonderful world of advertising, starting at Whybin\TBWA Auckland.From there, McKenty made her way into the international spotlight for her ‘advertising rebellion’, best seen through her disregard for discipline and convention. For example, she worked with her creative partner at the time to float shares in their creative future and successfully crowdfunded themselves to Cannes. She also Penny the Pirate, a children’s book that tested eyesight while at Saatchi & Saatchi Sydney, which was named as the most effective marketing campaign in the world by Warc 100 in 2016. Now at Google APAC, she’s tasked with coming up with creative uses of Google’s products and platforms for the Asia Pacific’s largest clients, such as creating real-time marketing platforms that reunite lost dogs with their owners for Pedigree, building immersive story time platforms for Disney and cofounding the diversity initiative RARE, supported by D&AD. All proof that McKenty continues to challenge and disrupt the status quo with her passion for using advertising as a medium for social good, which has resulted in over a hundred international advertising awards.Who better to serve as the Loeries 2019 Google digital communication jury president? I chatted to her about her judging expectations, what we can expect from her DStv Seminar of Creativity talk and more….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}It’s always an honour to be asked to judge international work, especially now as an international jury president for the Loeries. What does this mean to you, personally?Yes, it is always an honour. I’ve had the privilege to judge a few international shows now, such as D&AD, Spikes, and Cannes Lions, and of course to be asked to be a jury president is extra special. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495863-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Katja Thielen, creative director and founder of the UK’s Together Design and this year's Loeries design jury president..." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: "Discover how different cultures are reflected through their creativity and ideas" - Katja ThielenI chatted to the international jury presidents ahead of the upcoming Loeries Creative Week.

Culturally, I think New Zealand and South Africa share similar communication styles and a ‘nothing is impossible’ attitude towards creating the work. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Have you been to South Africa before? What are you most looking forward to from Loeries Creative Week 2019?  I’ve never been before, but my grandmother was from South Africa, and I have South African cousins who my father calls and heckles whenever the All Blacks beat the Springboks in a test match!<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/493957-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Some of team Mama Creative, from L to R: Kyle Gounden, Karla Strydom, Mishka Naidoo, Nicola Rossi, Adam Leontsinis, and Tetelo Nhlapo." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: Mama Creative explains why it's on all of us to tell better storiesYou've probably already noticed this year's striking Loeries campaign in your social media feeds and daily industry reads. But this year's campaign is a little different from those of previous years. Here's how Mama Creative hopes Loeries 2019 will inspire us all to tell better stories...By Leigh Andrews 26 Apr 2019So it will be my first time in South Africa and I am most looking forward to seeing the work and meeting the great creative talent in the region. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}And vice versa! The jury presidents also speak at the DStv Seminar of Creativity, a highlight for many attendees. What will your presentation focus on?  For my presentation, I will be discussing the advantages of inclusion, and discuss the power that differences of perspective can have on our ability to innovate, and produce original ideas, and connect more meaningfully with the vast cross-section of society that makes up our audiences. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1807/449892-120x120.png?2" alt="Makhathini in action at Kantar Millward Brown's offices in the Foreshore." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Unboxing diversity in advertising'Thinking outside the box' is a good way to improve your creativity skills.

What’s the biggest trend in advertising that you expect to see from this year’s entries? Machine learning provides a new set of tools for people to solve problems with, as creative practitioners we solve problems for brands and consumers, so I’m expecting to see a lot of work that is powered by machine learning. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Interesting. With so much advertising ‘noise’ out there, it takes a lot to stand out from the crowd. What will you be looking for in this year’s entries? I love work that provides true utility for the user and consumer, a lot of my own work has been utilitarian. Ideas that provide utility, or enhance consumers’ lives in a truly meaningful way are always a favourite of mine. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/494893-120x120.png?2" alt="Loeries CEO Andrew Human encourages everyone to tell better stories." width="120" height="120">#AfricaMonth: Advertising's shift beyond 'selling stuff' to tell better regional storiesIn our annual #AfricaMonth catch-up, Loeries CEO Andrew Human chats about what to expect from Loeries 2019, why judges are briefed to look for locally relevant experiences and communications, and the rising importance of brand humanity and problem-solving in creativity against the continued shift away from merely punting the client product or service...By Leigh Andrews 3 May 2019.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Lastly, share your views on how the calibre of our work compares internationally. Describe that ‘African and Middle Eastern creative essence’. Actually, two of my favourite campaigns of all time come from these two regions! Ogilvy & Mather Dubai created a print campaign in 2013 called ‘Autocomplete truth’ for UN Women, which I absolutely adore. The campaign used the Google search interface to highlight different societal attitudes toward women from different countries. Simple, powerful, and confronting. The second piece of work actually made me move countries to work for the South African ECD who worked on it – Damon Stapleton, former ECD of TBWA\Hunt\Lascaris – for The Zimbabwean Trillion Dollar campaign. I’ve always believed that as creatives, we have a responsibility to use creativity and our craft for social good. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475188.jpg" alt="#BizTrends2019: Year of the social impact brand (again)" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: Year of the social impact brand (again)Amidst two extremes -- audience apathy on one end and backlash against perceived social washing on the other -- the ad industry has emerged fresh-faced and focused: Ready to prove that we're thoughtful, attentive partners who listen when our audience speaks, able to hold a conversation that doesn't always place ourselves and our interests at the very centre of it...By Auryn Hiscock and Mikhaila Hunter 15 Jan 2019<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496415-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty" width="120" height="120">How marketing with CSR at its heart can change the worldFitting in perfectly with the rise of purpose-led marketing across the globe is Jeanne du Plessis, corporate affairs and citizenship leader at Procter and Gamble (P&G) South Africa.
