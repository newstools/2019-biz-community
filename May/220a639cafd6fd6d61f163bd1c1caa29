As true custodians of the brand, they have long wanted an opportunity to represent the brand in various ways and this campaign was a true response to that consumer market insight.  As people drive around our major towns and cities, they will be able to spot some familiar, local faces of the people who headline our campaign in much the same manner and pose as the captain they have all been accustomed to.” - Sibusiso Simelane, Captain Morgan Brand Manager.The 10 winners of the Captain Morgan Billboard campaign are being duly rewarded with a trove made up of a limited-edition personalised Captain Morgan pack. The coveted pack will carry their captain name, a professional photoshoot, a meet and greet with the original Captain Morgan, and the crown jewel prize of custom billboards of the crews plastered across the Eastern Cape, Western Cape and Gauteng.          “This is unbelievable - I mean me, Nwabisa on an entire billboard as Captain Old Skool? I could have never imagined, I thought these things only happen to famous people from other provinces. This has truly personalised my relationship with the brand, my crew and I still can’t believe it.” - Captain Old Skool: Nwabisa Vala.While the limited-edition bottles will have each captain’s name on the label, i.e. Captain Spicy or Captain Braai Boss, they will still contain the original sweet, spiced rum flavour that is savoured and loved across the globe. The Captain Morgan Limited Edition bottle is available in limited quantities at leading bottle stores across South Africa.Not for Persons Under the Age Of 18.About Captain MorganCaptain Morgan is a brand of rum produced by alcohol conglomerate Diageo.
