For those who miss the pre-registration cut off there is onsite registration – an option which costs R100. Local and international industry authorities will be showcasing the tech trends driving progress in the world of media and entertainment and the 2019 expo is the ideal platform to keep step with the changes that have transpired over the last two years. The highly specialised biannual B2B trade show attracts buyers, top decision makers and influential visitors and combines the latest technology with live demonstrations, presentation zones and special events and it’s the ideal forum for networking. Add to this the show specials coupled with the event’s unparalleled entertainment value and there are more than 10 good reasons to be at the 10th edition of Mediatech Africa. According to the organisers, the visitor count achieved two years ago exceeded 7,500 delegates and there’s no reason to believe this year will be any different. The event will once again be at the Ticketpro Dome in Johannesburg and will run from 19–21 July. Speaking about the 2019 event, Exhibition Director Simon Robinson says, “The tech deployed by the media and entertainment industry is profoundly progressive with a significant aggregate of development in motion since the last Mediatech. This growth is proportional to the excellence potential of the industry. This year visitors should be prepared for more creativity, inspiration, and innovation than ever before. Mediatech Africa will offer a glimpse into the future - where technology is driving disruption and distinction.” Familiar show highlights returning in 2019 include Black Box, the Drone Technology Cage, and the outdoor sound demos to list but a few.
