See the local wins underlined in the list below.  The “Best in Show,” Award was won by Helsingin Sanomat’s “The Land of Free Press,” a multi-media campaign touting the impact of its journalism amid a rising tide of about the fake news and misinformation.The Global Media Awards were presented before more than 400 delegates attending the closing dinner of the Inma World Congress of News Media at the Edison Ballroom in New York’s Times Square. Winners announced at Global Media Awards DinnerDuring the ceremony, 40 first-place winners were unveiled across 20 categories aimed at energising news brands, creating products, engaging audiences, developing customer insights, growing advertising revenue, and instilling innovation. Entrants were judged in two groups: global/national brands and regional/local brands. Inma has presented awards for media excellence since 1937. The 2019 Global Media Awards competition garnered 664 entries from 165 news media companies in 34 countries. Participants included newspaper media, magazine media, digital media, television media, and radio media.  An international panel of 46 executives from 15 countries selected 194 finalists, and from those the first-place recipients were announced at the Global Media Awards Dinner. Multiple awardsFive companies won multiple first-place awards. Jagran Prakashan from India and Schibsted across its diverse brands in Norway and Sweden took home three top prizes, while three others garnered two first places: Amedia from Norway, MittMedia from Sweden, and News Corp Australia.  “This year’s Global Media Awards first place recipients leaned heavily into the science of marketing with an emphasis on data, metrics, and return on investment,” said Earl J. Wilkinson, executive director and CEO of Inma. “Yet the brand campaigns stood above everything. Judges said the competition was intensively competitive, and the final decisions difficult. All winners and finalists should know that their efforts stand as the world’s best from the past year.” About the global “Best in Show”The global “Best in Show” campaign, “The Land of Free Press,” was produced by Sanoma Media’s Helsingin Sanomat around the 2018 summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. With both presidents expressing hostility to media, Helsingin Sanomat rented 300+ billboards along three possible presidential routes and projected messages in English and Russian like, “Mr President, welcome to the land of the free press.”  While it was aimed at two world leaders, the campaign sparked an international conversation about the role of the free press, generating 2,500+ articles in 47 countries and more than one million social interactions. Helsingin Sanomat estimates that more than 1.2 billion were reached. Google Trends data suggests a massive spike in interest about the free press. Hundreds of news organisations around the world joined an effort to support a free press.  Inma judges called the campaign a “gutsy concept that could have ended up being a generic press campaign, but the brand went big and got all the reward locally and internationally.” Sanoma Media is a leading news media company based in Finland with operations in various European countries.
