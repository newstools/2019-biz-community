"They wanted a tablet with a security holder that would allow cashiers and perspective clients to capture legal aged IQOS user information for communication purposes. The tablet had to be locked down to block users from accessing other webpages from the IQOS landing page and screen saver," explains Darren Kirby, Managing Director of Technique Media. Once the tender was granted PMI SA required a prototype within two days to present to Spar managers for approval. Thereafter units required manufacturing and device software and content installed within six to seven working days. Installation of the devices had to be coordinated over a two-day period to tie in with the launch of the new product, bearing in mind that these times also had to suit the availability of store owners/managers and PMI SA area reps.IQOS is a heat-not-burn, smoke-free alternative to cigarettes. After many years of research and testing, and much investment by PMI, the IQOS device launched as the pioneer in heated tobacco technology, a feat in engineering and science. There are already five million IQOS users worldwide. An innovative brand backed by its cutting-edge technology... naturally its tools should be as well.“As consumers become more tech-savvy the demand for brands to be innovative and include digital touch points in their strategies increases. With Technique Media’s turnkey solutions, quick turnaround times and out of the box thinking we're able to deliver the right solutions to brands that want to meet consumer demand", says Kirby. He continues, "This was the first time we've used this particular IT and telecommunications technology and, whilst deadlines were extremely tight, we had a lot of fun with the project and with the PMI SA team. We fulfilled our commitment from concept through to installation and we're thrilled with the end result.” For more information on the possibilities with digital solutions and displays call +27 (0)82 391 7717, email darren@techniquemedia.co.zabRev('brev-066ff7a9-188b-4264-9866-a222f2fcf18f', '>a/\<az.oc.aidemeuqinhcet@nerrad>"az.oc.aidemeuqinhcet;46#&nerrad:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<') or visit www.techniquemedia.co.za.
