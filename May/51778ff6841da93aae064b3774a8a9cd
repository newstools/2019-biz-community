The latest IAB SA and Effective Measure statistics show that MyBroadband attracted 2.1 million unique South African browsers and served 6.8 million pages in April 2019. This places MyBroadband firmly at the top of the Technology Publication Category, well ahead of its closest competitor - which only had 156,000 unique browsers for the month.

This makes it an excellent avenue to reach all South African IT decision markers.
