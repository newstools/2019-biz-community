That’s what makes them such excellent entrepreneurs – they’re used to making their own rules. And what makes them essential in the South African context is that when women succeed, they elevate those around them too. I’ll be looking for someone who has spotted a gap in the market and whose business could become a game changer in our economic environment.’ Professor Thuli MadonselaChair of Social Justice at Stellenbosch University and founder of Social Justice M-Plan and the Thuma Foundation, Professor Madonsela has been part of the judging panel since its inception. She has learned over the time being involved in the awards that South Africa has lots of talent, and that adversity is a breeding ground for entrepreneurs. “I will be looking for someone who is solving a problem in society; a woman who is building the world we want to live in. It is important that she looks toward Fourth Industrial Revolution” says Professor Madonsela.Johanna MukokiEntrepreneur, global motivational speaker, philanthropist and travel guru Johanna Mukoki will be looking for hardworking entrepreneurs who are focused to succeed. “I will be looking for a go-getter who isn`t fazed by the Fourth Industrial Revolution; someone who is an interrupter. I am also looking for someone who has empowered others in their success journey” says Mukoki. Dawn Nathan-JonesDynamic social entrepreneur, businesswoman, TV personality and second time judge Dawn Nathan-Jones will be looking for passionate entrepreneurs as it is as much about the person as it is about the product or service. “Give me a person who has all the right attributes – the passion, hard work and confidence. The product can always be re-engineered or recrafted; it really comes down to the person”says Nathan-Jones.Jo-Ann StraussInternational speaker and media entrepreneur Jo-Ann Strauss is a hardworking mom. She will be looking for entrepreneurs who are constantly working at success and who help others along as they move forward. “There should be an emphasis on how many jobs the candidates create and how many people they uplift as they get ahead. Creating sustainable employment is the mark of a truly successful person” says Strauss. Enid LizamoreExecutive Head of Human Resources at Santam Enid Lizamore believes SA is overflowing with opportunities. She admires women or creates a space within their business for other women to succeed. “I will be looking for a woman who shows perseverance and reliability and displays a learner’s mindset while at the same time being a role model for those around her is what I’ll be looking for in the Women of the Future winners” says Lizamore.
