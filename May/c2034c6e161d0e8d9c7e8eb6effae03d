"Nigerian authorities should immediately release Jones Abiri and permit him to continue his work without fear of retaliation."Abiri pleaded not guilty to terrorism, economic sabotage, and fraud, according to the charge documents and the Premium Times. Abiri was earlier this week summoned to Abuja from Bayelsa state, where he lives, by the Department of State Security, his lawyer, Ogala, and local activist Alagoa Morris, who have both spoken with the journalist, told CPJ. Ogala said he is preparing a bail application. Abiri was previously summoned for questioning by Department of State Security in March and April, according to CPJ research and Morris.CPJ's repeated calls to Peter Afunanya, a spokesperson for the Department of State Security, went unanswered, but in a response on a messaging app today, Afunanya said he was in a meeting and would "hopefully" respond. Calls and messages to Garba Shehu, a spokesperson for President Muhammadu Buhari, went unanswered. Lai Mohammed, Nigeria's minister of information, asked for communication via text message, but CPJ's subsequent messages to Mohammed went unanswered.
