Honored to be here to mentor as part of the #OneShow #Mumbai #CreativeBootcamp Thank you @k_swan for navigating us through some seriously interesting streets today.

This year I judged "social influencer marketing”. These days, a good measure of how creative or iconic an idea is, is if you admire it so much that you would share it on your social media timelines.Conversations started by brands that consumers actively and excitedly engage with. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/464989-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#SML18: How SA brands are approaching social media" width="120" height="120">#SML18: How SA brands are approaching social mediaThe first part of World Wide Worx's Arthur Goldstuck's SA social media landscape presentation he shared with us at Marketing Mix's Social Media Landscape Briefing 2019 last week...By Juanita Pienaar 24 Oct 2018I was excited to be judging this modern category that relies on harnessing the power of creativity to activate people to participate, to want to be a part of the conversation or help drive a cause. It’s really powerful when you see a brand becoming a catalyst to allowing people to express their own views to become part of the greater story. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490040-120x120.jpg?2" alt="What do we mean by influencers in South African terms?" width="120" height="120">What do we mean by influencers in South African terms?The local influencer industry is unique, and we need to define what we view as the different categories of influencers right here at home...By Anne Dolinschek 1 Apr 2019This is marketing of the “right now” and I loved analysing every one of the entries!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}That’s good to hear! Describe your personal judging process and how you stuck to the brief. Some years back, successfully utilising an influencer as part of a social campaign for a brand, often looked very different. It might merely have involved finding an influencer whose personal brand and values align with the brand, an influencer with a decent social reach. The chosen influencer would “broadcast” post or share information about the brand they were being paid to promote, and voila… the association was sufficient to be successful. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477499-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Olesia Bilkei ©" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: Social marketing, and true word (of mouth) powerWhen Marian Salzman, one of the world's top trendspotters, invited me to discuss all things social marketing trend-related over coffee at the end of 2018, I jumped at the chance.

My personal guide was to look for entries where:The brand storytelling was incredibly compelling; andThat story could not have been told without the influencer playing a major role in bringing the story to life.Where the cases got really exciting is where the influencers were not just used for their fame and reach, but also as an integral character in the unfolding of the campaign, with the rest of the world invited in. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Intriguing! Without giving too much away, talk us through the quantity and overall calibre of entries you judged and any stand-out trends. This year, we saw an incredibly high standard of entries. Multiple judging rounds were used, to ensure that the top work sifted to the top and was acknowledged. This category had entries from across vastly different brands and industries, some with huge budgets and well-known influencers and others with tiny budgets and “influencers” that might not be traditionally classified as such – on account of not even being on social media!<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/492093-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: Getty/Gallo Images." width="120" height="120">Influencer marketing - the value of micro vs macro-influencer marketing tacticsRirhandzu Shingwenyana from Sadmon lists ways in which nano, micro (mid-tiers) and macro influencer (mega influencers) are most effective and efficient when it comes to ROI...By Rirhandzu Shengwenyana 11 Apr 2019We continue to see good social cause marketing playing a big role. Brands using their power and sponsorship to influence positive social awareness and change in the world. It was equally refreshing to see powerful and entertaining storytelling utilised by brands to achieve their objectives, without having to pull on any moral or social compass. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/489630-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Viral Nation team at the Influencer Marketing Awards. © ." width="120" height="120">Viral Nation announced the Best Large Influencer Marketing Agency by Influencer Marketing AwardsViral Nation agency wins Influencer Marketing Award for "Best Large Influencer Marketing Agency" globally for 2019...28 Mar 2019Results in terms of likes and views are less and less of a focus in these sorts of cases today, with more emphasis on the power of the social campaign to be truly noticed by breaking into the mainstream media. We are also seeing more of a shift towards utilisation of multiple, lesser known influencers that form strong, genre-based communities than relying on the celebrity status influencer of old. This allows for wider social community engagement.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1708/408739.jpg" alt="FCB Joburg sends graduates to One Show ‘Minds Wide Open' bootcamp" width="120" height="120">FCB Joburg sends graduates to One Show ‘Minds Wide Open' bootcampTwo talented members of FCB Joburg's Graduate Programme have won a rigorous internal evaluation process and will be flying to Michigan State University in the US to attend the Minds Wide Open workshop...Issued by FCB Africa 31 Aug 2017Really interesting insights into who really holds the marketing influence today.
