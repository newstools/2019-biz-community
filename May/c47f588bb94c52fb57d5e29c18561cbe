With an impressive coverage in Gauteng, these 3m x 6m roadside billboards are strategically positioned to increase impact and reach of a campaign. What a brand was able to achieve over a one-month period can now be achieved over two weeks with the new package options from Primedia Outdoor. As an example, a Primelite campaign is now able to achieve a 46% increase in reach with the new rotation schedule. (ROAD 2015C+2016C+2017C).As part of this ground-breaking weekly rotation initiative across an entire holding, Primedia Outdoor has implemented four flighting zones across Gauteng for ease of booking and flighting rotations. Through a facilitated weekly booking system, all sites will only rotate within the relevant zones. For instance, when a Zone 1 site rotates, it will only rotate to another site within Zone 1. The weekly rotations are based on a calendar year and start from week 1 to week 52. "We are redefining the game and making our Primelites more dynamic but still remaining a cost-effective medium to showcase all brands. Traditional roadside static billboards continue to be a powerful medium to reach the consumers and maximise brands position in the market”, said Jorja Wilkins, Marketing and Marketing Services Executive of Primedia Outdoor. She added, “Offering weekly rotations on our Primelites, which are ideal for short-term tactical campaigns, reflects our commitment to ultimately deliver an optimised reach of an audience, intelligently and seamlessly; bringing campaign success for all of our clients."Located on main arterials, key intersections and around shopping districts, Primedia Outdoor’s Primelites are internally illuminated providing 24-hour exposure with a flex face flighting system that allows for quick creative change across the entire holding. These rotational Primelites serve as one of the top go-to solutions for high reach and frequency, reinforcing brand messaging that encourages consumer’s purchase intent.
