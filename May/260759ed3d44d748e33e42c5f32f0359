<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495925-625x417.jpg" alt="BizBrand Jam experience gives scholars new insight into 4IR careers" width="625" height="417">Schools are challenged to send teams of four  Grade 11 and/or 12 learners to the BizBrand Jam, where they will spend the first part of the day engaging in an online business simulation to obtain a realistic idea of what it’s like to run a business, think creatively, seek strategic solutions, and deal with everyday business challenges.The second part of the event will challenge learners to apply their creative and design thinking in an introduction to brand studies and brand management – subject streams that are not traditionally included in South African secondary curricula. “The BizBrand Jam will give Matric learners the opportunity to think more creatively, and the business simulation experience will inspire them to seek out tertiary programmes that will equip them to be strategic solution-seekers,” says Talita van Wyk, Programme Navigator - Brand and Business Management at Vega. “The experience will give them a snapshot of what is possible in the workplace if they’re armed with IIE Programmes, such as BCom in Strategic Brand Management, a BA in Strategic Brand Communication, a BCom in Digital Marketing, or a Bachelor of Business Administration in Brand Building and Management, for example.”Learners who have included Business Studies, Consumer Studies, Economics, Accounting, or Information Technology into their matric subject mix will find the experience most interesting, as well as those who have an interest in entrepreneurship. “Generation theory has revealed a noticeable shift in perspective among young people entering the workplace now,” explains Van Wyk. “Among other things, they want to forge their own career paths and they’re increasingly favouring entrepreneurship as it gives them the freedom to branch out and make a meaningful impact in their own unique and innovative ways.“They are choosing tertiary programmes that will equip them with the business skills they need, along with the creative thinking that’s essential to success in the ever-evolving workplace of the future,” Van Wyk adds.While the prize on the day is undoubtedly the specialised insights into the mechanics of the working world, the BizBrand Jam has been gamified to ensure maximum interest and participation from learners. The event will include a competition element in the business simulation section, which will see the winning school earning a R12,000 Takealot voucher, and each learner in the winning team taking home a R1,000 Takealot voucher. The Vega BizBrand Jam 2019 takes place on Saturday, 11 May 2019, from 08h00 to 16h30 at all four of Vega campuses.
