"These results will incorporate the Extel/Institutional Investor rankings of the South African sell-side industry, compiled from a survey of asset managers in 55 countries."For the fourth year running, Standard Bank SBG Securities was awarded as the Overall Top firm. As in 2018, Peregrine Securities maintained its position as the Top firm – Execution: Derivatives.Similarly,  RMB Morgan Stanley held its ranking as the Top firm – Execution: Equities Dealing, as well as maintaining top spot in the Corporate Access, Administration, and Sales Team categories. Rand Merchant Bank replaced Nedgroup Securities as the Top firm – Execution: Fixed Interest Securities for 2019. André Bekker from Arqaam Capital was awarded as Young Analyst of the Year 2019: Equities, while Odwa Sihlobo from Prescient Securities was named Young Analyst of the Year 2019: Nonequities. Intellidex's survey of SA-based asset managers covers about 90% of the institutional market and is compiled through a series of confidential questionnaires completed by domestic institutional clients of local stockbroker firms. The Financial Mail has been associated with this survey since 1975 - the only ranking in South Africa that provides a reliable and independent ranking of the skills in the industry. A special report on the 2019 research findings will be published in the Financial Mail on Thursday, 30 May 2019. Key accoladeStuart Theobald, the founder of Intellidex, which performed the research, said the FM rankings remain the key accolade for any broker to walk into a client pitch in South Africa. "The FM also goes further than ranking teams to cover analysts in 40 different research categories, providing the only way that clients can identify the leading brains on particular subject areas," he said. The new ratings come at a tough time for the broking industry, which is battling the impact of Europe's MiFID 2 guidelines, which compel stockbrokers to separate their fees for research and execution. Says Theobald: "Mifid2 has put significant pressure on budgets for research so analysts are now having to work harder to prove they are worth the value to clients. The FM rankings are one clear way that analysts who deliver value can be recognised."Herewith the list of categories and winners of the 2019 Financial Mail Top Analysts Awards:  **Winner in 2018*change noted since 2018SectorAnalystFirmYoung Analyst of the year : EquitiesAndre BekkerArqaam CapitalYoung Analyst of the year : Non-equitiesOdwa SihloboPrescient Securities**Gold MiningAdrian HammondStandard Bank/SBG SecuritiesPlatinum & Precious MetalsChristopher Nicholson and Jared HooverRMB Morgan Stanley**General MiningJohann Pretorius and Siphelele MhlongoRenaissance Capital**Oil & Gas and ChemicalsGerhard EngelbrechtMacquarie**Forestry & PaperBrian MorganRMB Morgan StanleyIndustrial MetalsThabang Thlaku and Tim ClarkStandard Bank/SBG Securities**Resources Small & Medium Market Cap CompaniesTim Clark, Thabang Thlaku & Leroy Mnguni and Adrian HammondStandard Bank/SBG Securities**Construction, Building Materials & MachineryRowan GoellerMacquarie**BanksStephan PotgieterUBS SAGeneral FinancialStephan PotgieterUBS SA**InsuranceMichael ChristelisUBS SA**Beverages & TobaccoRey WiumStandard Bank/SBG Securities**Food ProducersVikhyat SharmaRMB Morgan StanleyHealthcare Providers & PharmaceuticalsKane SlutzskinUBS SA**Luxury GoodsRey WiumStandard Bank/SBG Securities**General RetailersSean Holmes*RMB Morgan StanleyHousehold Goods RetailersKaeleen Brown and Ya’eesh PatelStandard Bank/SBG SecuritiesHotels, Travel & LeisureMichele OlivierRMB Morgan StanleyDiversified IndustrialsBrent MadelRenaissance Capital**Investment CompaniesRey WiumStandard Bank/SBG SecuritiesComputing & ElectronicsRuhan du PlessisAvior Capital Markets**MediaDavid FergusonRenaissance Capital**TelecommunicationsJonathan Kennedy-Good and *Preeti SukhaStandard Bank/SBG SecuritiesFinancial and industrial small & medium market cap companiesSumil Seeraj, Marc Ter Mors, Magdel Neale and Munira KharvaStandard Bank/SBG Securities**Real EstateNazeem Samsodien & Mahir HamdulayMacquarie**Africa Ex-SA equitiesEFG Hermes FirmEFG HermesAfrica Ex-SA non-equitiesDavid Cowan, Gina Schoeman and David LubinCitigroup Global MarketsCommoditiesJohann Pretorius, Steven Friedman, Kabelo Moshesha, Siphelele Mhlongo and Derick DealeRenaissance CapitalEnvironmental, social and corporate governanceWaseem Thokan and Rob Worthington-SmithLegae SecuritiesCredit AnalysisElena Ilkova and Kate RushtonRand Merchant BankDerivativesEmlyn Flint, Florence Chikurunhe, Anthony Seymour and Samantha JonesLegae PeresecFixed-Interest SecuritiesMike KeenanAbsa CapitalInnovative researchMary Curtis, Chris Nicholson, Brian Morgan, Vikhyat Sharma, Michele Olivier, Roy Campbell, Elan Levy and Sean HolmesRMB Morgan Stanley**Economic Analysis (domestic)Elna Moolman*Standard Bank/SBG Securities**Economic Analysis (international)Mary Curtis, Ian Doyle, Jonathan Garner, Andrea Masia and Jacob NellRMB Morgan Stanley**Investment StrategyMary CurtisRMB Morgan Stanley**Political AnalysisSimon FreemantleStandard Bank/SBG SecuritiesQuantitative AnalysisEmlyn Flint, Florence Chikurunhe, Anthony Seymour and Samantha JonesLegae PeresecRisk ManagementPetrus Bosman and TeamAvior Capital Markets**Technical AnalysisNeels Heyneke and Mehul DayaNedgroup Securities**Top firm : Administration EfficiencyRMB Morgan Stanley **Top firm: Corporate AccessRMB Morgan Stanley **Top firm : Execution: DerivativesPeregrine Securities **Top firm : Dealing: EquitiesRMB Morgan Stanley Top firm : Execution: Fixed Interest SecuritiesRand Merchant Bank **Top Sales TeamsRMB Morgan Stanley **Overall Top FirmStandard Bank /SBG Securities
