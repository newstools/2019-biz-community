Our main priority when designing for a site of this nature, was to ensure that the website would communicate the right information in order to generate greater awareness and fellowship applications. To achieve this, we ensured that the user experience formed the backbone of our research, design and execution, so that enough balance would be created between content and call to action. Because JIAS foster spaces in which academics can feel supported and free to develop their research, we divided the site into bold sections with enough "breathing space" as a manifestation of their service. From events, to news and then applications, each section was knitted together seamlessly and then bolted down by a clear call to action. In doing so, we ensured that every aspect of the site provided the right information; at the right time the user needed it - which meant a thorough redesign of imagery and copy placement. The new JIAS website is testament to how effective the right UX can be for business, and how, in it's dynamism can further help enhance the nature, personality and feel of a brand - all in one space.
