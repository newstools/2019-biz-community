Bringing the Soul Sisters to life in six 45” spots, and one 20” spot. An integrated campaign approach which looks to include elements such as TV, social media, digital, outdoor and activations, aiming to resonate and delight.  Each film depicts a scene where a sister needs some encouragement or celebration, and the Soul Sisters show up in support. They are backup singers in real life, there to back our sisters up. They embody women who reach out to help a fellow sister. Showcasing a more cohesive female bond where women support, shine a light on and show up for each other in various different situations. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/498538-625x142.jpg" alt="SoulSister brings some soul" width="625" height="142">“Imagine if you had backup sisters who popped up, whenever you needed them,” said Joe Public creative team Natalie Walker and Jeanine Vermaak. It was exciting to create an ad that celebrates women but still in a quirky, Chicken Licken® way.” Produced and directed by Greg Gray of Romance Films, the campaign delivers a humorous performance by the singing Soul Sisters trio. Their overall look was inspired by soul icons like The Supremes, and we recreated typical ‘60s wardrobe, hair and make-up to dazzle South African audiences. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/498539-625x142.jpg" alt="SoulSister brings some soul" width="625" height="142">“Because our concept was based on soul singers, we had to make sure our music was authentic, said Xolisa Dyeshana, Joe Public CCO. We worked with Adam Howard of Howard Audio, a classically trained composer and musician, to create our unique soul songs.”Of course, the real stars are the Soul Sisters, who devoted long hours in sequins and heels to bring the concept to life. Hopefully bringing sisters all over South Africa a smile, and inspiring them to back a sister up when she needs some soul.Watch the ads here (playlist): http://bit.ly/2HI3sLu.Credits Brand: Chicken Licken®Client: Chantal Sombonos van TonderGroup Chief Creative Officer: Pepe MaraisAgency: Joe Public United (ATL & Digital)Chief Creative Officer: Xolisa DyeshanaExecutive Creative Director: Roanna WilliamsSenior Art Director: Natalie WalkerSenior Copywriter: Jeanine VermaakCopywriter (Supermarket): Tshepo TumaholeGroup Account Director: Amber MackeurtanHead of TV and Radio: Di Cole Lead Actresses: Gugu Dhlamini/Nancy Sekhokoane/Kanyi NokweChoreographer: David MatamelaProduction Company: Romance FilmsDirector: Greg GrayExec Produce: Helene WoodfineDirector of Photography: Paul GilpinProduction Art Director: Keenan McAdamWardrobe Stylist: Bridget Baker + Sandra SmitEditor & Company: Ricky Boyd/DeliveranceVisual Effects Company: Chocolate TribeMusic Company/Composer/Sound: Howard Audio/Adam HowardPost Production Online: Jean Du Plessis/Chocolate TribePost Production Offline: Ricky Boyd/DeliveranceColourist: Craig SimonettiHead of Wigs and Hair: Daleen BadenhorstHead of Make-up: Marilyn du Preez
