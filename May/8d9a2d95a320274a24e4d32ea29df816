On voting day, the station will be celebrating the iconic Astley, whose song 'Never Gonna Give You Up' catapulted him into the world of pop in 1987. The song was a worldwide number-one hit, topping the charts in 25 countries and was the best-selling single of that year.From 3 May, OFM will place its 'Rick Astley for President' posters across central South Africa in Bloemfontein, Kimberley, Klerksdorp, Vanderbijlpark, Potchefstroom and Welkom. On election day, the station will run the 'Vote Rick Astley for President' campaign by playing Rick Astley’s music throughout its day-time shows. Every time a Rick Astley song plays, a listener could win R1,000.Says OFM’s marketing manager, Lindiwe Mtwentula: “Electing a new leadership for our country is a very serious matter. As a commercial radio station, we want to give our listeners something to smile about on the day. As our listeners prepare to face queues and make important decisions, we want to entertain them a little bit and give away some money. And what better way than through the music of an 80s icon?”
