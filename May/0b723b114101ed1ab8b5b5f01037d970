The Creative Dialogues event stems from a conversation on how to re-think our context beyond our town [Stellenbosch] and country [South Africa] to imagine and envision Southern Africa as a creative hub, a connected space rather than a space divided by national boundaries.  We are interested in how we can position education and learning, which is our core business, within an expanded pan-African context beyond the classroom and our institution.  With this in mind we have recently organised creative exchanges across Southern Africa as a core component of our BA Honours programme.  Two creative exchanges have taken place since the Honours programme started in 2018; July 2018 in Harare (Zimbabwe) and April 2019 in Maputo (Mozambique). Our intention with the creative exchange programme is to initiate a revolving project built on short-term collaborations between us and creative spaces in Southern Africa.The Creative Dialogues brings together South African industry leaders from the Norval Foundation, Zeitz Mocaa, HKLM, the King James Group, the Stellenbosch Triennale, as well as Mozambican counterparts such as Anima Estúdio Criativo,  DEAL Espaço Criativo, Piratas Do Pau and the National gallery of Zimbabwe, Moto Republik and Dzimbanhete Arts and Culture Interactions from Zimbabwe amongst others.  The Creative Dialogues ethos embraces multiple forms of ‘knowledges’ that are often-times overlooked as a result of parochial views on learning and expertise.We are hoping that the dialogues will foster meaningful cross-country and discipline exchanges, as well as expanded perspectives and engaging debates on the future of the creative industries within our African context.
