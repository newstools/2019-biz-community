During the visit, they discussed how Kaspersky Lab could collaborate with the Rwandan government and ways to better protect the country from cyberthreats.“Governments and enterprises across Africa need an integrated approach to complex threat detection and response as they fight cybercriminals who have significant financial resources and are constantly looking to exploit any vulnerability,” said Kaspersky, CEO of Kaspersky Lab.The Kigali office will serve the requirements of the growing number of partners and customers in the region. Kaspersky Lab’s award-winning solutions and services will be offered to all industries and for all kinds of businesses in Rwanda and the wider region.“We see great potential in the African market, especially with the current digital transformation initiatives that are in place. Nations across the continent are adopting new technologies to facilitate and enhance the way they do business. While a few years ago it was enough to have a strategy to prevent infection, today businesses have to be able to detect when they are infected or hacked, predict hacker behaviour and respond to attacks quickly to ensure minimal damage and impact. We can support in achieving this,” said Amir Kanaan, managing director at Kaspersky Lab for the Middle East, Turkey and Africa.Kaspersky Lab is a global company operating in almost 200 countries and territories across the globe. The new office in Kigali will be the 36threpresentative office the company has world-wide.
