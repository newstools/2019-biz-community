When, how and why did you get started?I started The Grey Ave Podcast in 2016. I was hosting strangers/travellers from around the world to sleep on my couch for free via an app called couch surfing. I had very profound conversations with these people and later I thought it would be a very good idea to record and share these conversations..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}I believe your podcast is currently the number 1 African podcast on Tech and business interviews.

Could you tell us about that moment you realised you wanted to enter this arena?I despise unnecessary bureaucracy and I strongly believe it is one of the main contributors of poverty in South Africa, especially to poor people. The Blockchain industry is mostly built around the idea of decentralisation, permissionless and borderless which means everyone can wake up today, setup shop and get into business with the rest of the world without having to worry about red tape, racism or nepotism. Once I realised this, I knew I could become more successful in market of that type.
