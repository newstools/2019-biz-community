Bringing people together from various creative disciplines to share their experiences. Over three days, experts from different sectors will engage in panel discussions with their audiences. The first day will see a panel discussion with Raphael Chikukwa (Chief Curator of the National Gallery of Zimbabwe), Christopher Till (previously Director of the Apartheid Museum and currently Director of Javett Art Centre), Vicky Lekone (Norval Foundation) and Liesel Hartman (Zeitz MOCAA).  Apart from packing a powerful punch, this panel brings together diverse institutions and even more diverse experience in the role of public and private art institutions in shaping how southern Africa engages with the world and vice versa. This is followed with conversations about alternative creative spaces in growing sustainable creative industries; and a panel of dynamic local creatives who are committed to their craft and promoting creativity as social practice. The following day of the programme offers a different emphasis with Khaya Dlanga (Chief Marketing Officer at Rain) addressing trends and issues in technology, innovation, advertising and marketing.  In a similar vein, Gary Harwood (Director, HKLM) will share his thoughts on branding in growing African futures and Francois du Preez will engage with future careers in creativity based on his work as Creative Director at PWCâ€™s Experience Centre.  In addition, there are panels on contemporary photography and art, and discussions that bring together start-up founders, writers and film directors. Curiosity, creativity, criticism, communication, collaboration, compassion and active citizenship.
