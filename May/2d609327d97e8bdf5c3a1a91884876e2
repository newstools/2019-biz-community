If you listen to KZN’s No.1 Hit Music Station then you would know that The Secret Sound is one of the station’s most entered competitions. The competition requires listeners to tune in to the ECR Drive Show and listen out for the mystery sound. Listeners then get the opportunity to call in and guess the sound that could win them R25,000 on the spot. The ECR Secret Sound Invasion will see the Bongani Mtolo, Mags and Gazza turn your office block into their studio where they will broadcast their show live. But it won’t be just any show, the entire three hours will be dedicated to allowing listeners to make their way down to the chosen office block (public area) to make their guess on-air! That’s right, if you make your way down to the outside broadcast, all you must do is stand in line to make your guess and you could be walking away with your share of R100,000. “I’m excited that we will be doing secret sound live and around KZN. I can’t wait to finally put some faces to the voices that call in during the show. Bring your whole family out to help you guess. I often find that kids are the best with guesses. I really want someone to walk away with that money,” said ECR Drive show host, Bongani Mtolo. The secret sound will invade one office block/park area once a week for the month of May. If you would like to enter your office park area, then visit the win page on ecr.co.za to make your submission. East Coast Radio is available on multiple streaming channels such as: The ECR app, ecr.co.za, iono.fm, itunes, Alexa, Deezer, TuneIn, Radiosa.org and on DStv channel 836.
