For the announcement schedule, please see the end of this press release. In a change from last year, whereby the number of Pencils awarded was announced over judging, this year D&AD is announcing all shortlisted work. This is in order to acknowledge the volume of high calibre submissions that were in close consideration for a Pencil. In the belief that all the good work should be seen, the shortlist will be exhibited at D&AD Festival as well as available on the D&AD website. The D&AD Awards Ceremony, taking place on Thursday 23 May, will unveil the number of Pencils and the levels won. Tim Lindsay, CEO of D&AD commented: For another year, creative luminaries from all over the world have come together at the Truman Brewery in London to judge this year’s D&AD Awards. D&AD is renowned for being one of the most prestigious awards, which is why we strongly believe that it is so important to acknowledge all of the great work that almost made it. What’s clear already - although this year’s judging is only just getting started - is that once again, the standard of work is incredibly high. We are excited to announce the first round of work that has made the shortlist today and we look forward to everything that’s to come over the next few days.Traditionally the toughest of the awards, the D&AD judging process is famously rigorous, with the juries only selecting work they believe is truly exceptional. This, plus the fact that there are no quotas for awards at D&AD, means the number of awarded entries fluctuates year to year. In some years, no Black Pencils - the highest creative accolade - are awarded; the record currently stands at just seven. D&AD FestivalAn exhibition of all shortlisted work will be on display for attendees to discover and learn from at D&AD Festival. Further details on D&AD Festival, which returns 21 - 23 May 2019 at The Old Truman Brewery, London, including how to purchase passes, can be found here.The D&AD Awards Ceremony where entrants will find out whether they have won a Pencil, will close the D&AD Festival on the evening of 23 May. Winning work will not only receive a coveted D&AD Pencil at the D&AD Awards Ceremony, it will also be displayed at exhibitions globally over the following year and featured in the D&AD Annual and online archive – the definitive guide for creatives all around the world.To keep up with all the latest from D&AD, follow the Liveblog here and look out for the official #DANDAD19 hashtag on social media.
