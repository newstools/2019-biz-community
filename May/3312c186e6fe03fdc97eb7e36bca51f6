<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496103-625x351.jpg" alt="Triton Digital integrates with Google DV360" width="625" height="351">The highly anticipated integration will have tremendous impact on the local audio industry’s growth, whereby advertisers are now able to buy digital audio advertising inventory across some of South Africa’s top podcasts and livestream broadcasts. The integration of Triton’s audio SSP and programmatic marketplace with Display & Video 360 has created the South Africa’s largest transparent programmatic marketplace. In the global announcement Benjamin Masse, Managing Director, Market Development and Strategy at Triton Digital, explains that the integration will greatly assist in “enabling publishers to deliver a smooth, high-quality listening experience to their audience by leveraging server-side audio ad insertion and native ad placement to provide a high return to their advertising partners.” Many advertisers and agencies in South Africa have consolidated their ad tech resources, using Google's ad tech stack to deploy and manage campaigns. Historically, buyers using DV360 were unable to access podcast and livestream audio ad inventory. The integration has enabled the transaction between programmatic buyers and audio publishers. Gehard Morkel, Trading Director at Nettrade Programmatic, comments, “This evolution provides us with an exciting opportunity to give our clients access to large audiences in Africa who are actively consuming online audio. For the first time in our market, we have programmatic access to placements within high-quality streaming radio and podcast environments, something we’re incredibly excited by.” The integration enables buyers using DV360 to create private marketplace deals (PMPs) and deliver audio ads in the form of pre-rolls, mid-rolls and post-rolls across a range of audio channels, including local broadcast stations Kfm, Cape Talk, 702 and 947.
