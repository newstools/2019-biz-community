Internet Andy Halsall, “Fon developed the Wi-Fi sharing model that now dominates the Internet landscape in the West. Wi-Fi sharing access points provide Internet in homes and on the streets of many developed nations, and we are proud to bring this technology to East Africa.”“High-speed home broadband with free access to thousands of Wi-Fi hotspots, and low-cost unlimited internet access on the street for those who can’t afford a home connection is transformational in bringing affordable internet to all Kenyans,” Halsall added.With this model, Poa! Internet, “saves consumers at least half the cost of buying internet and ends the tradition of counting MBs. They can stream or download files as large as they like, opening up the Internet to far richer use at a far lower cost,” he continued.Source: NexTVAfrica.com.
