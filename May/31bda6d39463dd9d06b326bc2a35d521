Key topics revolved around developing the event of the future, embracing technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to revolutionise events, and creating excellent visitor experiences and enhanced engagement. "As was explained at the MESE event, we’ve moved from a culture where delegates are asked to switch off their mobile devices, to telling them to turn their phones on and engage," adds Kim Currin, Currin’t Events event director. She agrees, however, that the message should still be the main focus. "A fine balance is required to integrate tech and innovation, without overshadowing the true focus of the event."<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/461979-120x120.jpg?2" alt="CTICC hosts AI robot Miss Pepper" width="120" height="120">CTICC hosts AI robot Miss PepperDeveloped by SoftBank Robotics, Miss Pepper, who is capable of interacting with humans and can adapt her interaction according to a human's emotions, was unveiled during the three-day Biomion World Nutrition Forum 2018 conference...8 Oct 2018 Across the country, forward-thinking events coordinators are already incorporating AI and innovative applications to enhance guest experiences. "From driving greater guest engagement to interactive agendas, digital breakaway sessions and information centres it is clear that events are evolving as the industry embraces digital transformation," says Dalziel. Evolving the future of entertainmentWhile the 'wow' décor, light shows, bots and drone technology enhance the visual aspect of the event, the basics are also augmented. "When guests enter with ease through a digitally driven registration system, are empowered to engage, vote or give feedback online, or can listen to different tracks in one exhibition hall on silent headphones, the entire event experience is enhanced," states Currin. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1808/453700.jpg" alt="The importance of the MICE industry and business events in South Africa" width="120" height="120">The importance of the MICE industry and business events in South AfricaWhat is MICE and how does it impact our economy?...Issued by GL events 20 Aug 2018From monitoring and analysing attendee data for effective crowd shaping, to creating seamless experiences with strategic AV, embracing bots and social media, and influencing event production worldwide through innovative and a 'be the best' approach, the local event industry is achieving it all.
