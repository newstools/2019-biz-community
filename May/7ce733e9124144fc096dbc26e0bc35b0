Designed to respond to the rising trend of conscious consumption, this new variant is targeted at consumers who want to preserve their social image by partaking in more mindful consumption, so that they can enjoy themselves in moderation for longer.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/498181.jpg" alt="Savanna Non-Alcoholic Lemon: Break the rules, change your world" width="625" height="417">To bring the launch to life through an integrated campaign, Savanna is challenging consumers to break the rules. Because when you drink alcohol, you’re confined by rules – social rules, law-enforced rules, even rules that you give yourself. And let’s face it: rules are no fun.This campaign is brought to life in the new Savanna Non-Alcoholic Lemon advert, which showcases the most unlikely characters challenging the norms of where a non-alcoholic cider should be consumed.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/498185.jpg" alt="Savanna Non-Alcoholic Lemon: Break the rules, change your world" width="300" height="448">“We’re constantly looking for innovative ways to corrupt the apple and bring to life products and ideas consumers will love,” says Annette Grootboom,  Global Brand Development Manager for Savanna, “The great thing about Savanna Non-Alcoholic Lemon is that it tastes like cider, which allows people to make a lot more choices – and break a lot more rules.” The campaign’s major focus is to get as many people as possible to experience life with no rules through a series of brand experiences, activities, partnerships and sponsorships – and, of course, to get as many bottles of Savanna Non-Alcoholic Lemon in people’s hands.“We’re talking to a generation of South Africans who are tired of being told they can’t socialise on weeknights. Who want to dictate their own fun. Who want to find adventures in average situations. Who want to bend the rules and shape their own world,” says Grootboom.So, feel like drinking cider on your next road trip, or fancy a night out before a 5am gym session and an all-day meeting with your boss? Or do you simply want the freedom that comes from reading your sent messages the next morning, and knowing there are no surprises? Savanna Non-Alcoholic Lemon may just be the thing for you...
