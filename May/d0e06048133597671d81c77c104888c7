These factors added to the campaign’s success,” he says. Telkom aligned with AdColony to extend their 30-second ad, into an engaging media placement, tasking consumers to interact with the video, while collecting and inputting a correct sequence of numbers. These were correctly completed over 460,000 times. Nivasha Pillay, Digital Media Lead for Telkom SA at media agency Vizeum, says: “Working with AdColony to bring to life our interactive video for Telkom Summer was both daunting and exciting. Mostly because it breaks the norm around what we do as a brand, and pushes our boundaries. The results were phenomenal and we are super proud of the work which was done as it hit our KPIs out the park in the first three weeks." “Needless to say we’re absolutely thrilled at the campaign’s performance and now we’re looking to get even higher stats on the next campaign!” says Andrew.
