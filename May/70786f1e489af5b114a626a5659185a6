We have an exciting second half planned for 2019, that is set to thrill, entertain and continue to deliver the best programming for our listeners,” said Programming Manager, Naveen Singh. The Smile 90.4FM ‘No repeat Workday’, where our audience is guaranteed not to hear the same song between 9am and 5pm, has resulted in the daily time spent listening increasing to a new high. In addition to this, Smile Breakfast as well as Smile Drive have grown in listenership. Our personalities becoming household names, stronger promotions with more to win and the best music has grown Smile 90.4FM’s attraction to listeners.
