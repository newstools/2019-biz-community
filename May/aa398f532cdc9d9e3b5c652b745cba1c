Right now, ensuring I give budget feedback. However, my to-do list changes daily, as most do, in order of priority or projects and urgency of deliverables.

I rely on morning news and industry mailers to get quick updates. Daily Maverick every morning and afternoon, Contagious, a few marketing podcasts, Bizcommunity, and The Media Online mailers as well as Wired and a few global mailing lists I’ve found interesting over the years. I make a point of reading Frenemies from a work perspective. I also enjoy watching anything on Netflix.Tell us something about yourself not generally known?
