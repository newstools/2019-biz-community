Waiswa: I did the judging online, in sections. Overall, it took maybe four hours for the first section and then two hours for the next round. It was really interesting to go through all the entries, to see the campaigns and work from creatives from different parts of the world..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} Let’s take that a little further: Describe your personal judging process and how you stuck to the brief. Tshabalala: I looked for technical ability and the conceptual approach that was hopefully applied to each piece of work.         View this post on Instagram           2019 so far. Pretty, Painful and Poignant.

Tshabalala: I probably judged over 200 entries and the calibre of entries was amazing. There's little difference in quality between the big guys and the smaller studios and individuals. The trends I've noticed are the use of bright colours and illustrators mixing textures with shapes to create bold and abstract designs.Waiswa: There was some amazing work submitted, but I would have like to see more entries from the continent.
