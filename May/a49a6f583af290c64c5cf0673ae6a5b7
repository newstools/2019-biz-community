BusinessTech has topped the IAB SA and Effective Measure’s South African Business Publication Rankings for April 2019, with 2.5 million unique monthly browsers and 5.6 million page views. Effective Measure is the official traffic measurement partner of the IAB South Africa and provides accurate traffic and demographics statistics for South Africa’s top websites.  BusinessTech’s excellent performance follows strong growth in recent months, with more South African readers visiting the site thanks to its exceptional coverage of the local business and technology markets. The latest demographics statistics for the publication show that it is particularly popular among C-level executives and managers in the banking, finance, information technology, and telecommunications markets. BusinessTech Editor Gareth Vorster said the exceptional growth shows that when it comes to online news, there is no substitute for high-quality content.  “Our commitment to high-quality articles and staying on top of the latest business and technology news is paying off, which is very satisfying,” said Vorster. This strong growth has also added tremendous value to advertisers and partner companies, with a big increase in successful advertising and content campaigns on BusinessTech in 2019. “Our advertisers have seen an unmatched return on investment thanks to BusinessTech’s growth,” said BusinessTech sales director Cara Muller.
