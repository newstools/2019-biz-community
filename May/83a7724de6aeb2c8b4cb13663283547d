The #ToyotaStoriesSA and Snooze campaign, conceptualised by FCB Joburg, takes these stories and packages them as a short music video with music choice and words reflecting the persona of the fan and his or her Toyota. “This fun, quirky and memorable content is housed on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Instagram stories... and celebrates the love Toyota fans have for their cars. It’s also a shout-out from Toyota to acknowledge this passion,” Mthimkhulu said. The first #ToyotaStoriesSA video – Jitesh and his Corolla: http://bit.ly/2DxdgUC – went live in March last year and drew an incredible response: over 90,000 YouTube hits and 1,400,000 impressions on social channels. It was quickly followed by a second – Anchal and her Hilux: https://youtu.be/pcG-DDC6IXI – while three others punctuated the remainder of the year. FCB Joburg Creative Director Tian van den Heever explained the evolution of the campaign: “Julia’s Conquest featured octogenarian and intrepid explorer, Julia Albu, who travelled from Cape Town to London through Africa in her trusty 20-year-old Toyota Conquest ‘Tracy’ to create awareness for Shine Literacy. Her reggae-themed video generated 30,826 views on YouTube. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497429-625x374.jpg" alt="Kaizer Chiefs star in #Story6 in Toyota SA's #ToyotaStoriesSA campaign" width="625" height="374">“Then, our homie from Pretoria, Thato, and his RunX attracted 76,968 views while the final chapter for the year, inspired by the Instagram fan page @ToyotaTribe, provided Snooze with the content he needed to create a very entertaining Christmas Carol and generate a further 66,047 for #ToyotaStoriesSA. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497430-625x308.jpg" alt="Kaizer Chiefs star in #Story6 in Toyota SA's #ToyotaStoriesSA campaign" width="625" height="308">“And now the 2019 chapters have kicked off with none other than Kaizer Chiefs Football Club. Toyota is the official vehicle sponsor for team and its starry players, and the piece they have filmed is utterly awesome. The players sing along with Snooze in traditional locker room pre-match prep tradition – goose bump stuff! “Filmed at the Kaizer Chiefs village in Naturena by Fuel Content, it’s a little taste of what else is to come in 2019 from #ToyotaStoriesSA. Watch this space.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497431-625x352.jpg" alt="Kaizer Chiefs star in #Story6 in Toyota SA's #ToyotaStoriesSA campaign" width="625" height="352">View all four music videos here:Credits:Client: Toyota South AfricaSenior Manager – Advertising & Digital Marketing: Tasneem LorgatManager – Social Media Community: Naniwe Mthimkhulu Creative agency: FCB Joburg Executive Business Director: Reagen KokAccount Director: Nicole MalanExecutive Creative Director: Brett MorrisCreative Director: Tian van den HeeverArt Director: Naledi Manama Copywriter: Shannon KoorContent Writer: Lucy Holford-Walker                               TV production: Nakita Bolus      Media planners: Lange SitholeProduction companies: Fuel ContentDirector:  Tian van den HeeverPost production: Fuel Content
