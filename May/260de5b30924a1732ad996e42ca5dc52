With the 2019 South African General Election just around the corner, denimwear brand Levi’s has approached some of the country’s leading influencers to help increase voter awareness and turnout amongst young people. As it did in the US 2018 mid-term elections, during which it partnered with various organisations as well as big name celebrities to help spread the message of “It’s Your Voice, It’s Your Vote”.“Levi’s is all about self-expression and, at this time, your vote is the ultimate expression of your voice. We really wanted to get behind this and create a movement, particularly, amongst the youth. There is power in them hearing this message coming from their favourite actress, musician or sportsperson and we are proud to partner with them to deliver it,” said Candace Gilowey, Levi Strauss South Africa’s head of marketing.

We looked to partner with influential personalities across a broad spectrum of industries, some who we have had a long-standing relationship with as friends of the brand and in industries where there is a natural fit like music, culture and fashion. We had the lead influencers and then seeded tees to many other micro-influencers and personalities all with influence. In addition, we wanted to give the opportunity to their fans to stand a chance to also be a part of the campaign by reposting and standing a chance to win a tee of their own.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/494818-625x469.jpg?1" alt="L to R clockwise: Maps Maponyane, Qaanita Orrie, Pabi Moloi and Siv Ngesi." width="625" height="469" rel="">L to R clockwise: Maps Maponyane, Qaanita Orrie, Pabi Moloi and Siv Ngesi.click to enlarge.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What makes them the ideal ‘fit’ for the Levi’s brand? One of the most important criteria was a fit with the brand’s positioning of authentic self-expression – they had to be a credible voice in their sphere of influence and they needed to be aligned with our values and messaging around ‘Use Your Voice’, specifically feeling passionate about using that voice to drive awareness and a call to action to vote in the election..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are some of your expectations for this campaign? Our hope is that we raise awareness and start a conversation specifically amongst young people that sees a higher turnout for the youth in the 2019 elections. We are already seeing good engagement on social media.We want our local fans to get to know that Levi’s has a legacy of standing up for social causes that define our times.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/494819-625x469.jpg?1" alt="L to R clockwise: Nomzamo Mbatha, Francois Van Coke, Katlego Maboe and DJ MoFlava." width="625" height="469" rel="">L to R clockwise: Nomzamo Mbatha, Francois Van Coke, Katlego Maboe and DJ MoFlava.click to enlarge.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why encourage young people to vote in this particular General Election?As I said, doing good is in our DNA and we have many great stories but we haven’t really spoken to our fans in South Africa about this until now.
