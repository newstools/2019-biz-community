For example, just imagine what it would be like watching the adventures of four African teen girls living in a neo-futuristic Lusaka, Zambia, recruited by a retired secret agent still committed to saving the world through a low-budget superhero operation. That's exactly the fantastically African premise behind a new action comedy series devised by Zambian writer Mulendema, Mama K’s Super 4.No longer just a pipe dream, it'll be on your screen soon, as Mulendema was one of eight winners in the Triggerfish Story Lab pan-African talent search initiative in 2015, supported by The Walt Disney Company and The Department of Trade and Industry. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/493153-120x120.jpg" alt="Netflix inked deal to collaborate on its first African animated original" width="120" height="120">Netflix inked deal to collaborate on its first African animated originalNetflix has inked a deal to team up with South Africa's Triggerfish Animation Studios and UK distributor CAKE on an African animated action-comedy series...17 Apr 2019Mulendema grew up watching cartoons on TV and found herself asking why no heroes looked like her and why they didn’t live in a world that felt like her own. Just like that, the idea for Mama K’s Super 4 was born. Designed by Cameroonian artist Malcolm Wope, it draws visual inspiration from retro-1990s R&B and hip-hop girl groups and brings a fresh perspective to a classic cartoon genre, with the team of four using their smarts to fight rich and powerful opponents.And as part of a continent-wide initiative to engage local female writing talent, Mama K’s Team 4 is now being produced by Cape Town-based Triggerfish Animation Studios and London-based kids’ entertainment specialist, Cake.While Variety reports that the series has been in progress as a 25 x 22-minute 2D-animated project since September 2017, with its launch date yet to be announced, I chatted to Mulendema to find out more about what led her to create the series, as well as her advice for African content creators, inspired by this specific success….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}This is excellent news for creators across the continent. What led you to create the series?I created the series in response to a call by Triggerfish Animation in 2015 for storytellers on the continent. In creating a superhero show set in Lusaka, I hope to introduce the world to four strong African girls who save the day in their own fun and crazy way. Most importantly, I want to illustrate that anyone from anywhere can be a superhero.I was interested in creating something that celebrated African ingenuity in a fun and exciting way..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Love that. Who did you look up to while growing up? As a child, I found reporters very interesting. They seemed so in charge. They seemed to know everything!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} Share the importance of giving a whole new generation of African children the opportunity to see themselves on-screen in the powerful, aspirational characters they look up to. This is the type of show that will inspire children to use their imagination a little more. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496865.jpg" alt="Scenes from Mama K’s Super 4." width="600" height="400" align="center">Scenes from Mama K’s Super 4.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496867.png" alt="Scenes from Mama K’s Super 4." width="600" height="400" align="center">Scenes from Mama K’s Super 4.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496869.png" alt="Scenes from Mama K’s Super 4." width="600" height="400" align="center">Scenes from Mama K’s Super 4.It may help them imagine endless possibilities for themselves. It will be a show, I hope, that will make them ask 'what if?!'.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Excellent, Share some advice for African content creators, inspired by this specific success. My advice would be to create what you are interested in seeing. I hope the show will inspire those who, like me, had never considered animation, to start to explore it to see if it’s a platform they would want to use to tell stories.It’s sure to inspire many.
