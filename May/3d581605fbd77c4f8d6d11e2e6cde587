That’s especially fitting for Semenya as The International Association of Athletic Federations (IAAF) has finally ruled, but not in her favour. Instead, they said she will have to take medication to lower her testosterone levels if she wishes to continue competing internationally in running events.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/494843-120x120.jpg?2" alt="EPA/MARTIN DIVISEK" width="120" height="120">Caster Semenya: how much testosterone is too much for a female athlete?The South African athlete, Caster Semenya, has lost her case against the athletic governing body, IAAF, which means that she will have to take medication to lower her testosterone levels if she wishes to continue competing internationally in running events...By Daniel Kelly 2 May 2019<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/494881.jpg" alt="Outrage over CAS ruling on Semenya" width="120" height="120">Outrage over CAS ruling on SemenyaSouth Africans have reacted to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) ruling on the case between Caster Semenya and the International Association of Athletics Federation (IAAF), saying the outcome is discriminatory...2 May 2019<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/495051-120x120.jpg?2" alt="It's not clear where human rights fit in the legal ruling on athlete Caster Semenya" width="120" height="120">It's not clear where human rights fit in the legal ruling on athlete Caster SemenyaOn May 1 the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) issued a highly anticipated ruling involving athlete Caster Semenya...By Annette Greenhow 3 May 2019The case has led to outrage about her basic human rights being violated, with Sport and Recreation Minister Tokozile Xasa commenting:You remain our golden girl. What you have done for our people and girls is enormous. You have flown our flag high. You have united a nation and inspired a rural girl. For that, we thank you Mokgadi.Because ironically, just before the ruling, Semenya again proved her power by winning the Doha Diamond League 800m race.The IAAF has since updated its standing to say “athletes like South Africa's Caster Semenya are welcome to enter men's events if they are not willing to take medicine to lower their testosterone levels”.Celebrating differences rather than looking for samenessUnderstandably, Semenya refuses this too and there’s more support for her than ever before.Articles pointing out the ethical flaws in the ruling on intersex sport have been popping up the world over, with SA’s own Trevor Noah adding his views on The Daily Show, and The Washington Post asking: We celebrated Michael Phelps’s genetic differences.

Semenya herself has since said she’s willing to sacrifice her 800m world championship title in her fight against the landmark ruling against her on testosterone-reducing drugs. There has also been a flurry of reshares of Nike’s ads supporting Semenya, in which she’s heard saying:Will it be easier for you if I wasn't so fast? Will it be simpler if I stopped winning? Would you be more comfortable if I was less proud? That's too bad, because I was born to do this.That’s the spirit that made Dream Crazy a winning campaign. We can’t wait to see what they come up with next. Rewatch the Caster Semenya Nike clip below.
