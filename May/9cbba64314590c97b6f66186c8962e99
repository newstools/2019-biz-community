New for this year, emerging professionals have also been shortlisted for the newly introduced ‘Next’ awards - a special subcategory designed to recognise the work of creatives, designers and crafts practitioners who have worked for no more than three years in the creative industries.All 1,642 shortlisted pieces will be listed in the 57th D&AD Annual published later this year.Decided by specialist juries made up of over 250 of the world’s top creatives, the shortlist was announced live over judging in three stages. Today’s announcement of an additional 1,067 entries across the final 20 categories, marks the final additions to this year’s shortlist. D&AD President Harriet Devoy commented: Each year, the D&AD Awards demonstrate the enduring importance of creativity, and in 2019 we are delighted once again to have received a high calibre of entries from across the world. This bold, brave and inspiring work, spanning across all creative disciplines, has been a joy to recognise and reward. We’ve announced the Shortlist, and look forward to sharing and showcasing the full spectrum of work over the next few days at the D&AD Festival, and announcing the winners at our Awards Ceremony on Thursday 23 May.The D&AD Pencil is regarded as one of the creative industry’s highest accolades with juries only selecting work they believe is truly exceptional. This, plus the fact that there are no quotas for awards at D&AD, means the number of awarded entries fluctuates year to year. In some years, no Black Pencils - reserved for work that is groundbreaking within its field - are awarded; the record currently stands at just seven. Winning work will also be displayed at exhibitions globally over the following year and featured in the D&AD Annual and online archive – the definitive guide for creatives all around the world.Shortlisted entrants will find out whether they have won a pencil at the D&AD Awards Ceremony, taking place on the final day of the D&AD Festival (23 May). D&AD CEO Tim Lindsay commented: After a busy and inspiring few days of judging, we’re excited to open our doors for this year’s Festival. As well as a schedule of inspirational talks and sessions delivered by some of the industry’s leading creative practitioners, all work in consideration for a Pencil will be on show throughout the Truman Brewery for attendees to discover and learn from. D&AD Festival offers genuine insight into what creative excellence means today, the breadth and diversity of which is a real testament to the industry, and to the future of creativity.The D&AD Festival returns to the Truman Brewery 21 - 23 May 2019 and tickets are still available via the D&AD website. The D&AD Festival exhibits the world’s best in advertising and design as well as hosting interactive workshops with Adobe, an exhibition of extraordinary solutions by Microsoft Surface, and a series of informal talks on the new for 2019 Social Stage in partnership with Whalar.
