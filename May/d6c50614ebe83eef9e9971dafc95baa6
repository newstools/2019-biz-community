I live in Sandton and work in Fourways, but my office can be anywhere on any given day. I play all over Johannesburg.I was born in Ghana and moved to South Africa in 1993.

My recollection of my early life was that of a very close-knit family where we always received visitors at home. 2. What’s your claim to fame? I would say my passion and drive to improve in all spheres of my life, whether personal or professional.My parents were generous, hardworking and loving.
