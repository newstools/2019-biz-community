It’s great to have someone with his talent and integrity returning to SA and our Group,” says Mashigo.Chaudhry left M&C Saatchi Abel four years ago to join M&C Saatchi London as Strategy Director.He led a diverse range of clients including NatWest Bank, the British Government and projects across Europe, Bahrain and Tokyo. Whilst in the M&C Saatchi London agency, he co-founded Black and White – a strategic consultancy within the PLC.For the past two years he has been invited by the United Nations to deliver keynote talks on 'The Power of Communication'.“Faheem is without a doubt one of the rising stars in the M&C Saatchi Worldwide Group. He will play a pivotal role within our Johannesburg agency leadership team. His infectious energy and experience gained in London will prove invaluable,” adds Mashigo.“This feels like a triple homecoming for me - returning to the city I grew up in, alongside a group of partners I admire and trust, in the agency where I spent my formative years. Gaining global experience at M&C Saatchi’s HQ in London for the past few years has been fantastic, but ultimately the pull of home and completing the M&C Saatchi Abel Johannesburg leadership alongside Neo, MK and Adam was too strong,” shares Chaudhry.He continues: “I believe South African creativity is going to enjoy exponential success over the next decade. Trevor Noah, DJ Black Coffee, Dr Ester Mahlungu, Nelson Makamo, Trevor Stuurman, among others, are all building SA’s cultural capital on the world stage. A huge commercial opportunity for organisations will be to stake their claim in, and contribute to, South African culture. It’s the perfect climate to build brands that are locally transformative and globally admired. The chance to work with our people and in partnership with our clients to drive growth for their businesses, and for the South African economy, is a challenge I find both critical and irresistible,” said Chaudhry.“We were exceptionally excited when Faheem showed interest in returning to SA.  It’s great news for our clients and the agency.  Together with Neo, MK and Adam, he will ensure we continue to deliver on our purpose of creating beautifully simple solutions in an increasingly complex world while driving our transformation and diversity ambitions in SA,” concludes Mike Abel, Founding Partner and CEO M&C Saatchi Abel Group.
