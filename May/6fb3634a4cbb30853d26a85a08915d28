Built on the legacy of Amps, it includes product and brand research designed for marketers and media planners which is independent of any commercial interests, is transparent and neutral. Available on an exclusive basisThe Maps survey will be available on an exclusive basis to subscribers that sign up for it. The pre-launch subscription drive to meet the funding requirements of a study of this scale has been successfully completed, with a majority of SA’s top 50 advertisers giving it their support.  The survey has been designed around the products, brands and intermedia needs of marketers and their agencies, providing single source insights on consumer, media and brand interaction."This is an exciting time for the marketing, media and advertising industry and has been a long time in coming, but I am pleased to announce that Maps research will start in July this year," says Virginia Hollis, chair of the MRF. “We now have a sufficient number of committed subscribers which has enabled us to press the ‘GO’ button.The survey will only be available to subscribers and their designated agencies, giving them a significant edge over competitors who don’t subscribe. The research will be released on a quarterly basis with a rolling 12-month sample.” Comprehensive national product and brand data“Aside from giving subscribers by far the most comprehensive national product and brand data, Maps will drive improved advertising effectiveness and ROI. Subscribers have input into the research, including a marketer driven resolution to the segmentation model. It’s the familiarity and comfort of Amps but modernised, updated and greatly enhanced,” says Greg Garden, the CEO of Masa and a director of the MRF. “This research solution delivers what marketers and their agencies specified as important to them, filling the void left by the demise of Amps” he concludes.  “It is not too late for further subscribers to sign up, and we look forward to welcoming additional brands to this ground-breaking research that will provide them with the most reliable insights into media-driven consumer awareness purchasing and usage behaviour.” For additional information, please contact MRF on 011 463 5340 or marie@mrfsa.co.zabRev('brev-a3351ec8-8e5e-4f84-bcda-b6b162881319', '>a/\<az.oc.asfrm@eiram>"az.oc.asfrm;46#&eiram:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
