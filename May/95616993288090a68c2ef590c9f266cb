"We are excited to partner with like-minded organisations committed to sharing an authentic and positive African narrative with the world. It is the core, foundation and inspiration of all our work at the AMA," says Barry.  Commenting on the partnership with AMA, Thebe Ikalafeng, founder and chairman of Brand Leadership Group noted that having worked previously with AMA it was a natural transition to partner with an organization with "an immense knowledge of the African media landscape and passion for communicating a positive African narrative." The Brand Africa 100 ranking is based on a survey among consumers 18 years and older, conducted in 25 countries across all African economic regions, which collectively account for more than 80% of the continent's population, GDP and leading brands and businesses. Giving an insight on the launch of the 2019 Brand Africa 100 to be held at the JSE, Ikalafeng explained that, "brands are shareholders and customers' repository and barometer of the image reputation of businesses and consequent value that is reflected on their market capitalization on the stock exchanges." The rankings are published annually by African Business magazine and Brand Africa partners. The 2019 African Business magazine's report on "Africa's Best Brands" which includes the Top 100 Most Admired Brands in Africa, the Most Admired African Brands, the Most Admired Financial Services Brands and Most Admired Media Brands, will be on shelves globally in June.
