It was shot over a day and a half in Thokoza Park Soweto by Bomb Films’ Teboho Mahlatsi.“This ad – part of a 360 campaign showing kids the value in Black Cat and enticing them to ask for it by name – features a group of energetic kids, with unassuming talents, playing cricket in the park. However, thanks to the boost of peanut power in Black Cat, two of them land up living the dream and wowing their mates with their sporting prowess,” said Creative Director, Greg Cameron.“Parents needed to be assured that kids are getting the necessary nutrition from Black Cat Peanut Butter, and that, with Black Cat in their lunchboxes, they have the energy to be the best they can be,” he said.The 30-second TVC can be seen here:Creative credits: Creative Agency: FCB JoburgGroup Account Director: Bronwyn SimmonsAccount Executive: Kholosa MadikaneChief Creative Officer: Ahmed TillyCreative Director: Gregory CameronCopywriter: Sandile HamiltonArt Director: Luzuko WitbooiSenior Integrated Strategist: SizweSihle DlaminiTV Producer: Mun-Ying De LacyProduction House: Bomb FilmsDirector: Teboho MahlatsiPost-production: The Ludus upstairs
