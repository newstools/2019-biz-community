Following the collaborative work Boomtown participated in for the creative design of the 2018 Isuzu Ironman 70.3 World Championship, which was held in Nelson Mandela Bay in South Africa, Boomtown was asked to develop the logos for the two pinnacle events on the Ironman and Ironman 70.3 Series calendars. The Ironman themesEach year the Ironman World Championship has a theme based on its birthplace of Hawai'i, while the Ironman 70.3 World Championship takes on the identity of the destination that successfully bid to host the race. The change in theme and destination for each race, results in a need to develop a logo to reflect each event.The application for the Ironman World Championship reflects the 2019 race theme which is `Ohana. Meaning a family that shares a deep bond. Boomtown began with the use of the Hawai'i state flower, the yellow Hibiscus. "The logo features people at the centre of the flower representing unity and family,” remarks Boomtown MD Andrew MacKenzie. “And behind the Hibiscus are the rolling waves of the ocean.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/499312.jpg" alt="Ironman briefs Boomtown to develop the Ironman and Ironman 70.3 World Championship logos" width="625" height="237">Just as Nelson Mandela Bay won the 2018 bid to hold the Isuzu Ironman 70.3 World Championship, Nice, France was selected to host the 2019 event.
