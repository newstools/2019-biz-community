The report analyses the regulatory response across the Americas, Africa and the Middle East, Europe and Oceania. The proposals are extremely fragmented: although the countries' shared objective is to fight the spread of disinformation, there is no unique regulatory solution and the results often raise serious concerns for freedom of expression.However, it is possible to define at least two main trends. Some countries have criminalised the spread of disinformation by sanctioning users and/or social media platforms for failure to comply with domestic legislation. Others have chosen not to intervene in the information market, electing instead to further promote media literacy and forming task forces and working groups to analyse the risks.It seems at any rate safe to say that democracies at all stages of development feel that disinformation threatens their systems, and it needs to be regulated.DownloadThe report is available to download here.
