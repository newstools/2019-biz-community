Armed with this belief, Parenty’s mission is to offer a voice to the multitude of diverse stories of parenthood in South Africa with the goal of portraying parenthood in all its messy, imperfect, impossible, hysterical glory – no filters, no BS, no promises – just the truth.Parenty is a collaboration between The Citizen, a team of parenting bloggers, including One Messy Mama, Black Mom Chronicles and The Ugly Truth of Being a Mom, and an array of content creators, contributors, experts and brands. With the intention of offering parents an innovative and rich destination for all things parenting and life in general. The brand is a combination of jester and outlaw and plans to create a stir in the South African media landscape with its edgy tone, ironic sense of humour, diverse and locally nuanced content, and no holds barred approach to storytelling.
