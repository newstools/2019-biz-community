Here are some fun activities to consider:  Go on a winter hike. Go camping with your family and learn survival skills. Cook a meal as a family with each member preparing a different dish. Read a good book. Visit a museum. Go see a good movie. Clean out clothes and household goods and donate them to charity. Plan a family holiday in another province. Play board games.  Knit a scarf.  Keep moving. And, when you do go on holiday with your loved ones, please observe the rules of the road and travel safe. Life is precious. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497937-625x282.jpg" alt="We are putting brands into hands again this winter" width="625" height="282">AutoReach In-Car Activationswww.autoreach.co.za You can also follow us on Instagram @autoreach_promotions.
