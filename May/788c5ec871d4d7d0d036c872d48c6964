24.com recently carried out a mobile study showing the power of mobile digital advertising in detail not shown before by existing campaign and performance measurements. Traditionally, campaign performance in digital is measured by focusing on reach (awareness) and conversion (purchase) related activities, with attention being paid to clicks (CTR). This study shows the more holistic value add that mobile digital advertising provides that extends beyond the immediate measurement of clicks and conversions. A novel technological solution is used to measure these more holistic effects, showcasing the innovative and transformative power of digital.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/498169.jpg" alt="Gareth Lloyd" width="300" height="400">Gareth LloydLloyd’s presentation will share insights about how different modes of advertising (video, rich media, still images) should be used with different campaign objectives, and how messaging type can produce different brand lift effects..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to regarding speaking at this year’s IAB Summit19?

The publishing industry has placed considerable emphasis on digital transformation and in comparison to many other industries in South Africa, it is more advanced and mature.The biggest challenge the digital publishing industry faces is to adapt and refine its underlying business model. Many well-known publishers abroad are realising the limitations of relying predominantly on advertising as a revenue stream. As a result, digital publishers that produce trustworthy, quality content at scale are required to look to alternative revenue streams. The optimal business model is still very much a work in progress..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What does ‘the new now’ mean to you? The new now means capitalising as best we can on the momentous opportunity that digital transformation provides through better understanding of how it works and how it affects us, but it also means facing up to the challenges it poses:An open protocol gives rise to bad actors who have contributed to the current problem of ‘the dirty web’ (fake news, spam, malicious ads, viruses, hacking).The internet scales at a rate that is faster than our capacity to address current problems with it (i.e. these problems will extend to the internet of things as devices become more connected).Centralisation and monopolies are a threat to the democratisation of data and the transparency of its utilisation.With the current open protocol foundation of the internet, existing centralisation (information and market share accruing to a few dominant actors) will intensify as the usefulness and power of data escalate with the adoption of AI. This is because those with the largest repositories of data on people will become even more powerful and socially integrated as AI becomes embedded in everyday life (in other words, those who have the most information about us will be able to find the best use cases for AI outputs).The new now requires a clear vision on accepting and addressing these issues, many of which require strong ethical decisions to be made.Book your ticket here or to learn more about Gareth Lloyd, the study, the programme, event sponsors and the lineup of the day, visit the event website and remember, IAB members get a discount!
