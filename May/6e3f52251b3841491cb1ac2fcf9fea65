<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/498235.jpg" alt="Total Africa Cup of Nations - Let the games begin" width="625" height="671">Total signed a partnership agreement with CAF in 2016, becoming the official title sponsor of African football for eight years. Total became the title sponsor of 10 competitions — three inter-club and seven nationals. The partnership started in 2017 in Gabon with the prestigious Africa Cup of Nations, which was renamed the Total Africa Cup of Nations.  Total operates in 43 countries across the African continent, being the number one retail network with nearly 4,200 service stations. “The African continent is the cornerstone of Total’s global presence, and this partnership allows us to deepen our already strong roots and strengthen our ties with stakeholders and fellow Africans. Football is a universal language synonymous with friendliness, enthusiasm and, of course, energy,” says Pierre-Yves Sachet, Total South Africa’s CEO and Managing Director.In celebration of the sponsorship and in the spirit of African sports talent, Total South Africa is partnering with 32 schools across the country, in nine provinces to ignite football talent and nurture the soccer culture. The school games will make provision for 14 boys and 14 girls in each grade to play a soccer game to stand a chance to be selected as the top boy and girl player of their grade. These top players will then participate in skills-based soccer activities for a talent scout to select the best players from each school. The winners of each school will be part of a lucky draw to win tickets to attend one of the Bafana Bafana Games in Egypt. In addition to the soccer activities, there will be a Safety session at each school to highlight the importance of Road Safety in a fun and engaging way. Each learner will be given an educational Road to Safety activity booklet with colouring in pencils and reflective stickers that can be worn on clothing to be more visible on the road.  “At Total, safety is more than just a priority, it's a core value and the basis of our strategy. We are excited to engage with learners by means of the soccer activities as well as the Road Safety sessions and we look forward to a successful journey as a partner of African football,” concludes Sachet.
