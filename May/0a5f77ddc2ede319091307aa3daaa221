The company supplies biodegradable tokens to the festival, park or sporting industries but these are also relevant to those looking for different and environmentally friendly promotional items. The tokens are completely natural and, if left behind or dropped, will simply biodegrade into the soil. They must be seen to have their vast usage potential fully understood, and visitors who require tokens for catering, festivals, hospitals, events, congresses, schools and the like should make a point of stopping by the Orakel stand. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/498056-625x418.jpg" alt="Madex visitors in for a treat at the 2019 #OGMarketingExpo" width="625" height="418">Did you know that every year, brands and retailers throw away around one billion kilogrammes of cardboard through the use of traditional displays?
