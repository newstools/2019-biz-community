When we believe that there is a challenge worth solving, we throw our collective weight and effort at it. When we started seeing the stats on voter apathy, we felt it was a cause worth tackling. We always look at opportunities for our clients and ourselves that make it mean something and this was one that we could not ignore.”Being nonpartisan means that Grid Worldwide is impartial to which Party you should (or should not) vote for, the idea is ta raise awareness in the public that if you don’t vote, you may as well agree. Grid Worldwide’s Nathan Reddy is a strong supporter of South Africa’s democracy and a staunch believer in freedom of speech.  His passion for freedom and the agency’s collective ethos in #MakeitMeanSomething’ is the force behind the Vote4aChang campaign which broke in the Citizen newspaper election special 29/04, followed with digital outdoor and supported by street posters campaign at transport hubs around Gauteng and CT. The entire mix of the campaign is also being supported by ongoing Facebook and Twitter campaigns and a few PR channels.Grid Worldwide would like to urge any South African who was considering not to vote, to go to their polling station and make their mark in the upcoming general election on the 8th of May. It is the only way to ensure your voice is heard and counted for in the future direction of our country. #makeitmeansomethingwww.facebook.com/Vote4aBetterSAFor more information contact Sasha Kupritz: 0834496841 / sasha.kupritz@gmail.combRev('brev-e86d3fb0-f8f5-4018-afbe-732b7b8687bd', '>a/\<moc.liamg@ztirpuk.ahsas>"moc.liamg;46#&ztirpuk.ahsas:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<')
