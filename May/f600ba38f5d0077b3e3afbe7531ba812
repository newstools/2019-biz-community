I am over-the-moon to be made one of the 'influencers' to the coolest cognac campaign, ‘Courvoisier Collective'," says Yanga Chief after being unveiled as one of the 2019 Influencers. Yanga Chief is currently working on his solo project and has a couple of tours planned. Partnering with Courvoisier Collective is, for him, a historic moment. The 2019 Influencer campaign will celebrate cultural expression of these individuals’ influencers and further celebrate their outstanding heights in their craft by sharing a moment with Courvoisier Collection of cognac. On the night of the unveiling of the Influencers, Nonkululeko Mcanyana, brand manager for Courvoisier, said, “I am so excited that these three amazing Influencers, Prince Kaybee, Nadia Nakai and Yanga Chief, agreed to be part of the ‘Courvoisier Collective’ campaign. "The trio were selected because of their influence, ambition and creative vision. These are 'influencers' who create new trends, and are trailblazers who carve new paths. We knew we had to give them something different to talk about, something special, something completely individual, that’s the 'Courvoisier Collective'." The Courvoisier is the only cognac producer that enjoys Napoleon Bonaparte endorsement and was therefore named as "the Cognac of Napoleon". "I am thrilled of this opportunity. I never thought of me being selected as the Influencer of an award-winning cognac like Courvoisier. It doesn’t get bigger than this, babe,” said the excited songstress, Nadia Nakai. “Courvoisier’s commitment to quality, design and art speaks to me.” Prince Kaybee, on his acceptance remarks, said: “I commend Courvoisier for selecting local talent to represent them in Mzansi, then, bringing celebrities from abroad. This shows how serious they are in being part of the local cultural expression. It was easy for me to agree to be part of the Courvoisier Influencers as I believe the brand has similarities with my Sesotho culture, which solicits more creative diversity and [an] inordinate sense of cultural belonging.”
