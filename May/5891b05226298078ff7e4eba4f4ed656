The mission of MIIA is to help establish and foster key relationships and partnerships within the Artificial Intelligence ‘Network of Excellence’ - thereby creating a strong, innovative Machine Intelligence and Data Science community and dialogue in Africa.With vast experience in new markets and verticals across multiple sectors, Kamara is dubbed an expert in various technological arenas, including e-commerce, internet solutions, digital applications, and financial payment solutions. He will share 20 years’ leadership experience and invaluable knowledge on technologies, as well as market entry and start-up growth strategies – having worked with and within multiple companies and industries, including technology and gaming start-ups in Europe, Asia, the Caribbean, and Africa.Dr Ludik, founder and president of MIIA (Recipient of the AI Leader of the Year 2019 Award), as well as founder, group CEO and managing director of Cortex Logic, said, “We are very pleased to have Mr Kamara join the MIIA team at this critical time in the rise and global awareness of the tech ecosystem in Africa.“There’s still so much work to be done, especially in the Data Science space – from education and institutionalisation, to the creation of leverage platforms within the AI value chain. Mr Kamara will serve as an invaluable addition given his track record, global experience, and networks. He also contributes incredible knowledge and experience, which will play a vital part inMIIAs ambitious plans to grow Machine Learning and Data Science in Africa at a rapid and exponential pace.”Dr Ludik continued, “An enriching and collaborative dialogue, within the Artificial Intelligence ‘Network of Excellence’, is currently taking place and building a solid foundation for the research and innovation agenda in Africa. Progress on this agenda will depend on the collective wisdom and action of multiple stakeholders within the AI arena. Africa can truly benefit from leveraging cutting-edge Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies and connecting with like-minded individuals and entities along the way.”Dr Nick Bradshaw, Cortex Group CMO and director at MIIA added, “We, as a community, need to collectively identify gaps in the African AI Ecosystem in order to create an AI pipeline for growth– all of which starts with creating platforms for sustainable relationships to be developed between academia, investment, government, entrepreneurs, and other key industry players. To this end, MIIA is not only onboarding industry experts to drive our global vision, but we’ve also recently launched www.AIAfrica.wiki – a comprehensive country-level review of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning resources, people and projects in Africa.”Kamara added, “I am very pleased to join this remarkable institution that is set to integrate and enhance Machine Learning and Data Science within the continent’s tech-space. These two elements will play a crucial role as an increase in Machine Learning usage, in multiple industries, will act as a catalyst that will push Data Science, increase relevanceand, in parallel, enhance high-value predictions that can guide better decision-making and smart actions in real-time, without human intervention - helping Africa solve some of its critical social and economic problems. I look forward to serving as a bridge in advising and leveraging governments, higher learning institutions, businesses and entrepreneurs in the investment, usage and application of Machine Learning and Big Data in Africa.”MIIA is currently on an active and dedicated drive to access funding to propel its mission and projects in support of Africa’s sustainable development goals and to help create the needed social economic impact on the continent.
