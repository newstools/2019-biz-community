Announced live throughout judging (18 - 20 May), the D&AD Awards Shortlist was introduced in order to acknowledge the volume of high calibre submissions that, even if they didn’t win a Pencil, were in close consideration. D&AD CEO Tim Lindsay commented:It has been another outstanding year for global creativity, with entries received from 73 countries. The theme for this year’s festival has been “Shaping the Future” and that’s very much been reflected in the campaigns we’ve had the privilege of seeing, many of which attests to the power of creativity to help build a better future. The work I have seen has been fantastic and everyone on the jury and everyone who has seen the final list of Pencil-winning work has been knocked out by the quality. It is a hugely encouraging sign for the buoyant and vibrant direction of our industry.Companies of the yearTop 3 Advertising Agencies of the Year are:Droga5 - D&AD Advertising Agency of the Year 2019adam&eveDDBMcCann New YorkTop 3 Design Agencies of the Year are:Jones Knowles Ritchie - D&AD Design Agency of the Year 2019ServiceplanAppleTop 3 Production Companies of the Year are:Academy Films - D&AD Production Company of the Year 2019FurlinedSomesuchTop 3 Clients of the Year are:Apple - D&AD Client of the Year 2019The New York TimesMarsResults by countryUnited States topped the country rankings - with the United Kingdom coming in second and Germany third.Ranking (by number of Pencils)CountryNumber of Pencils Won1United States2232United Kingdom1583Germany404France365Brazil326Japan277Australia238Canada169South Africa1510=Spain1410=Colombia1410=China1413New Zealand1114Thailand915Singapore916=Sweden716=Netherlands718Switzerland619United Arab Emirates520=India420=Hong Kong422=Russian Federation322=Pakistan322=Mexico322=Italy322=Ireland322=Denmark322=Belgium322=Austria322=Argentina331=Slovenia231=Romania231=Philippines231=Morocco235=Vietnam135=Ukraine135=Turkey135=Slovakia135=Poland135=Peru135=Lithuania135=Indonesia135=Hungary135=Greece135=Dominican Republic1“Next” winnersThis year also saw an additional 17 Pencils awarded to “Next” winners.

And her creations for the biggest artists in music mean her work has shaped the Instagram memories of millions. Her craft is incredible. Its scale, awe-inspiring. She turns spaces into spectacles and makes magic happen in front of our eyes. She doesn't just break the fourth wall, she shatters it in ways no designer has before.D&AD will announce Network of the Year and regional rankings in early June 2019.
