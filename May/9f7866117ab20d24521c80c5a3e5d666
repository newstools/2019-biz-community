Banele is fascinated by history, particularly African literature and it is this passion that sees his story unfolding after he secured a bursary to study at the Johannesburg Metropolitan University.  Banele’s story is that of trials; he is the first person in his family to go to university and that becomes both a great privilege and a massive responsibility as his family heavily relies on him for help. Being the sole bread winner is no glitz and glam and Banele quickly finds himself working as a recycler in order to send money back home. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496091.jpg" alt="Oros Mampofu bags major role on Rhythm City" width="560" height="373">“I am very excited to Join Rhythm City and play Banele. Banele is a representation of what society is dealing with, especially students. So it gives me such an honour to play such a well-thought-out character. Joining Rhythm City is super exciting and I can’t wait to see what the journey has in store for me,” expressed Oros Mampofu. As the pressure continues to build on the young man, will he survive in the City of Gold?
