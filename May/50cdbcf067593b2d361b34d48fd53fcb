When the economic outlook is upward, media investment starts following by climbing, because people have more disposable income and start spending more. When people spend more, sales increase and media investments reach new heights.However, in South Africa, the opposite is happening. The economy is not performing well, which means sales aren’t happening; margins are being impacted, and so are the media budgets. As mentioned in the previous article, Don't let the current economic storm lead to emotional decisions about your media budget, the South African economy is currently taking strain and still categorised as a developing economy.Some South African brands have responded well to this dilemma, while others haven’t. Even large brands, which have the largest market shares, are vulnerable. Brands are floating in a sea of uncertainty and to top it off, consumer behaviour is changing. This opens a few areas of consideration and greater possibilities in the advertising sector in terms of audience targeting and designing budgets around audience shifts. As consumer habits continue to evolve and consumption becomes even more fragmented, not committing to annual deals will be the key to directly connecting audiences in an organic, authentic and measurable way-in fact, in Ashish Williams’ opinion, the CEO of MediaCom South Africa, this will be paramount for brands in their quest for continued growth and relevance.“But committing to annual deals lead to discounts!” most brands would argue. Yes, but brands should also ask themselves at what cost. Before you sign on the dotted line...“It’s not about the commitment of money, but the commitments of the audience.”In South Africa, television is still the predominant advertising medium, accounting for 56,3% of the total advertising spend of R38.13bn (Source: The Advertising Industry). This clearly shows that traditional media still plays a concrete role in the industry locally, but this is continuously growing as the audience evolves into their natively digital comfort zones-a process that involves continuous shifts.This is why media buyers need to shift their buying strategies from signing annual deals to smart and effective spending of budgets. Above all else, agencies have to aim at buying audiences, and not media. “It’s about how you spend, but at the same time, it’s about how you buy. The business is not the same as it used to be. If you need to get higher ROIs, you need more agility to change every quarter. You cannot have a commitment when the audience is shifting, even if the audience is shifting within a single platform. You should be able to move the money every quarter to get better deals,” says Ashish. If your audience is constantly changing, how you invest money in advertising should also continuously adapt. He continues to explain that these audience shifts aren’t necessarily from traditional channels to new media platforms, but can even be shifts within a single platform from a specific channel to the next. MediaCom’s GroupM and Insights reports have also shown that a lot of money is being pushed above the line onto new, emerging platforms, such as Instagram, which has greatly impacted brands’ decision-making. Newer mediums will start taking more shares away from older mediums and technologies, just as smaller players will start taking more shares away from bigger brands.Many agencies receive more attractive discounts when booking content for long periods, but in this dynamic era, it is almost impossible to foresee where a brand’s target market will be in a year’s time-or even a few months’ time. More importantly, this strategy involves continuous audience monitoring and data collection. Knowing where your audience is now is one thing, but trying to predict where they will be in the distant future is nearly impossible. Change is the only constant“If your audience is constantly changing, how you spend the budget should also change.”Fortunately, the size of the budget doesn’t hold much value now; it’s more about making smarter investment decisions-especially reassessing the investment plans and properly managing annual budgets. Investing in media commitments has become more complex due to the increasing number of channels, fragmentation of consumers, and data integration opportunities. Despite the complexity these elements bring, the attributes of the data produced by monitoring the media engagement, shopping behaviours, online interests, and physical movement of consumers are producing richer consumer profiles. Many are still struggling to create a unified view of the consumer and apply it to their entire media strategy, but this is why it is essential to simplify, streamline and adjust media plans in real-time by using short-term strategies, constant planning and proper execution.Although media commitments are evident throughout the whole paradigm of media buying, it’s especially true in traditional formats. Ashish calls it the legacy of the discount, where brands fall into a trap of focusing on the sale only, rather than on the audience. A new media buying mindsetSo, how can we be more agile in shifting our budgets in traditional?In the current economy, many feel the urge to take on a discount to sidestep inflation and have more control over budget planning, but this won’t necessarily increase overall ROI. To maximise ROI, buyers have to look at short-term budget allocation instead of long-term commitments. Making space for more agility to change every quarter will definitely allow for higher ROIs. And although people are exploring more and more ‘new’ platforms, traditional is still king in South Africa. The trick is to find a balance between the allocation of budget and media planning to acquire the most satisfying results. Shifting budgets within certain mediums on a constant basis is a sure-fire way to make sure your audience is targeted continuously throughout the year. It’s about how you approach commitment to media deals, whether you take on that discount offered to you on an annual deal and continuously evolving with your market. Five focus areasAshish concludes that if brands want their media buying mind-set to be as adaptable and agile as their audiences, they need to do at least five things: Focus on their audiences, not only on the sale. Relook their commitment models. Evolve with their audience and grow with them. Continuously adapt their budget to shorter-term deals. Analyse ROI and adapt if necessary.The impact of technology on media planning is significant, but real campaign success completely relies on how you plan to target your audience and grow with them.
