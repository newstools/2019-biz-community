Its awards have grown into a truly global celebration of creativity, while the D&AD Festival will this year welcome 3,000 attendees to London’s Truman Brewery from 21 to 23 May. D&AD has continued to support the next generation of creatives through its thriving New Blood festival, awards and academy, with the Shift programme creating a pathway into the creative industries for those outside traditional academia.Powell comments that it's time for someone else to pick up the baton and to help guide the organisation through its next decade. “Needless to say, I have absolutely loved doing the job but, apart from it being time for a change, my wife would really like to see a little bit more of me," he said.“Tim and I have been talking about how best to organise a succession plan for several months. Early on, he said that he would be very interested in becoming chairman if the timing was right for him. I think this is very good news indeed - Tim has been a fantastic CEO for D&AD and becoming chairman is a great way for D&AD to hang onto all that experience, enthusiasm and capability,” Powell continues.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/482860-120x120.png?2" alt="D&amp;AD announces judging criteria for D&amp;AD Awards 2019" width="120" height="120">D&AD announces judging criteria for D&AD Awards 2019This year's D&AD judging criteria has been designed to spotlight and highlight creative excellence according to discipline as the first deadline for entries approaches (20 February)...18 Feb 2019“Not only has it been a privilege to serve D&AD as CEO for seven years, it's been the most enormous fun,” Lindsay says. “We have a great COO in Dara Lynch, a great team and an appetite to go even further in standing up for creative excellence and a fairer, more diverse industry. I'm looking forward to providing continuity and helping us tackle the new challenges in a new role. I'd also like to pay a huge tribute to Dick Powell. He's been an extraordinarily brilliant chairman.”D&AD has appointed the Talent Business to assist in its search for a new CEO.
