The new category recognises creative excellence on the YouTube platform, for advertisers and agencies creating ads for YouTube or creating YouTube cuts of ads.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497981.jpg" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty" width="400" height="400">Image source: Gallo/GettyBumper ads (six-second non-skippable ads) and skippable ads (minimum seven seconds, maximum any length video) will be eligible.To qualify for entry, ads need to have been flighted within the Loeries stated entry dates. Advertisers and agencies can enter a single entry, comprising a bumper ad or multiple bumper ads (e.g. a series of bumper ads that together tell a story), or a campaign entry featuring at minimum one skippable TrueView advert (minimum seven seconds, maximum any length video advert) and a minimum of one bumper advert (six second non-skippable video advert).For advertisers, this means there is a huge, addressable market that they can target with ads specifically tailored to take advantage of digital video platforms like YouTube, and the benefits they offer,” says Google SA head of Creative Agencies Artwell Nwaila. “These benefits include the ability to use ad formats to tell creative stories, make ads as long or as short as advertisers like, take viewers along a journey and drive key actions beyond just the view.”	Here, Nwaila goes on to tell us more about the reason for adding a YouTube category and what they’re looking for in this year’s winning work….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why did the team at Google SA decide to add a YouTube category to the Loeries this year?The consumer viewing landscape is rapidly evolving. Video is no longer just about TV, it’s about online platforms like YouTube as well. Our data shows that people watch ads on TV as well as on YouTube, and advertisers are starting to create ads specifically for online platforms. As such, it makes sense that this should be recognised in industry awards like the Loeries..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why do you believe it’s time YouTube is included in the Loeries as a platform on which to recognise creative excellence?The data shows us that more people are consuming content and are spending longer periods on YouTube. The change in viewer behaviour not only influences consumers, but it also influences the way in which advertisers communicate. Therefore, it is important to highlight and acknowledge creative excellence on the platform.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1708/406501-120x120.png?2" alt="Lorraine Landon" width="120" height="120">#Loeries2017: A deep dive into YouTube and video advertising (masterclass)An interview with Lorraine Landon, head of agencies at Google South Africa to find out what one could expect to learn from the Google masterclasses on ‘YouTube: all you need to know for campaign success' and ‘video advertising: what works best when'...By Jessica Tennant 17 Aug 2017.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What would you say to encourage advertisers and agencies to enter?YouTube is a playground for creatives to experiment with different ways of serving video, e.g. sequential storytelling.
