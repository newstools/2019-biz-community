Emojies illustrating expressions in Kreol (hence the name), the Kreojis mark this new half-century with a dash of cultural modernity.From telling your friends that your ‘pan is hot’, when you have a deadline coming up, to feeling like a ‘monkey in the music’ when you’re caught in a discussion you understand nothing about, these kreojis are bound to spice up any conversation with typical good-natured Mauritian humour.Young Mauritians may always be on their phones, but they won’t be forgetting their roots anytime soon!
