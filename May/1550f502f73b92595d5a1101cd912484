Our new Winter 2019 range is about the colours of winter, the raw textures of nature and the beauty of long-lasting materials like leather and wood.”“Just like Blomboy celebrates beauty by finding ways to make fauna and flora more permanent, Weylandts strives to celebrate nature’s beauty by using natural materials to create long-lasting functional objects which provide pleasure to the senses for many, many years," Weylandt adds.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/498771.jpg" alt="Blomboy's floral designs grace Weylandts window" width="620" height="408">The installation will be displayed until the end of July 2019 to coincide with Weylandts Sandton’s new Winter look along with the season’s furniture and homeware ranges.
