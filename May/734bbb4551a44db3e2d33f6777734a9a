Here’s a quick overview:What is retargeting?It’s a tool used by many brands to follow potential leads around the internet until a purchase decision is made. When a user visits your website, that user is tagged with a piece of code, known either as a cookie or a pixel. To allow us to retarget these users, the code follows web users around the internet displaying ads in both top and sidebars of various platforms. These platforms include all social media pages these users may have access to as well as all Google affiliated websites. Why use retargeting?With approximately 4.1 billion active internet users around the world, digital advertising has never been more important. The opportunities facing brands out there are endless but building trust with an online audience is a lot more tricky today than ever before. Building trust and brand loyalty is key to online success and that’s where retargeting plays a big role. According to Connectio, retargeting ads are 76% more likely to be engaged with because a potential customer has some level of knowledge of your brand after visiting your website or using your app. Following this initial connection, it makes for easier purchasing decisions to be made versus trying to sign them up on first impressions. Keep calm and let’s get retargetingRetargeting should be a no brainer and should be utilised by all brands that are looking for new customers, want to engage with current customers and ultimately get customers to purchase from them, not once but on-going. It’s a simple, yet effective tool for any brand looking for numbers in the green.
