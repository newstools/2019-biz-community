The D&AD Awards aim to inspire and celebrate the best in design, digital and advertising. Winning a D&AD Pencil remains the pinnacle of many careers and is considered one of the top international awards to win. “Being awarded in London last night, is truly something that the entire Joe Public United agency could not be prouder of. Not only is it critical but also a massive achievement on all levels as this firmly places the agency as a global player. We want to congratulate and thank our partners as well as every single one of our people, as it takes a village to raise an idea,” said Pepe Maris, Group Chief Creative Officer, Joe Public United. The agency worked with renowned director Greg Gray from Romance Films, to create a quirky yet cerebral comedy about a science teacher who invents a robotic version of himself to fill in whenever the craving strikes. We meet Sbu, an unassuming science teacher who is up to something in his garage workshop late at night. We quickly discover that he manages to pull off what could possibly be his greatest achievement ever. Using a hopscotch of recycled metal and computer parts, he creates a functioning, somewhat autonomous, robotic version of himself. His very own Sbu 2.0. The film plays out a variety of scenarios where the real Sbu is replaced with his 2.0 version – confusion and chaos ensue.
