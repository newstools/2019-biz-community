By using insights aligned with the unique South African consumer and with their favourite sport as a vehicle to enhance and evolve the global brand positioning. By combining South Africa’s inherent love of sport with a literal once-in-a-lifetime opportunity the brand team was convinced they could connect with their target market through sport, and their consumers' passions. “It’s crucial that as caretakers of international brands we be very conscious that our brand positioning remains truly South African and that it sticks with and resonates with local consumers.” - Gareth Marshall - Senior Brand Manager South Africa.By creating a unique sponsorship property, the brand was able to connect meaningfully with its target market, in a cluttered marketplace, on a small percentage of international budgets. “I truly believe that as brand managers we must have the courage of our convictions, to really get behind a campaign and back it all the way no matter what.” - Gareth Marshall - Senior Brand Manager South Africa. The learnings from the above case study may surprise you.
