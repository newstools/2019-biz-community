She is currently pursuing opportunities to build sustainable co-living spaces and communities.Here, Sun talks us through her philanthropic mission to encourage young girls to pursue careers and success in the underrepresented fields, as well as the importance of seeing opportunities in unlikely places where others thought there was only a dead-end….bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Let’s start with your link to Africa. You completed most of your schooling in Swaziland, where your mother also ran a business. Talk us through your memories of this time – what you most enjoyed, and how they contrast against your experiences elsewhere in the world. I was born in China, and grew up there as well as in Swaziland, but completed my tertiary studies in the San Francisco Bay area on my own, at the age of 19. After college, I also lived and worked in Paris, France for a year and Tokyo, Japan for six months.My father is a professional athlete-turned-university professor and my mother is a mechanical engineer-turned-entrepreneur. Growing up watching my parents being the stars of their industries made me believe I can accomplish anything I put my mind to.  During my time in Africa, my formative years, I really enjoyed the beautiful, natural landscape and the diversity of African culture. I met many great people who changed my worldview, and I learned, from watching my mother and other local entrepreneurs, that businesses should not only be profitable but also positively impact local communities. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496415-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty" width="120" height="120">How marketing with CSR at its heart can change the worldFitting in perfectly with the rise of purpose-led marketing across the globe is Jeanne du Plessis, corporate affairs and citizenship leader at Procter and Gamble (P&G) South Africa.

Economist Dr Dawie Roodt explained the implications at last week's Ads24 Food for thought session...By Leigh Andrews 15 Oct 2018Gender and racial inequality have had a profound impact on the lives of people in Africa as social norms favour boys over girls in most aspects of life. There is, therefore, a direct correlation between gender and race, the ability to exercise civil rights, and the possibility of reaching one’s full potential. Taking this further, only by taking concrete steps toward more diversity in hiring will Africans be able to address and close the gender gap in the workplace..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Definitely. Let’s shift our view to the horizon for a moment: You're involved in taking bird’s eye-view photos via aerophotography. Explain how this works.I usually do it from a helicopter without doors. You get strapped on to the edge of the passenger seat, from where you can extend your body out of the aircraft in order to get good shots. I love it because it combines my thirst for adventure with my passion for photography. It’s fun, artistic and exhilarating. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497393.jpg" alt="Examples of Sun's aerophotography." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1905/497395.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="1080" data-lheight="810" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Examples of Sun's aerophotography.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497397.jpg" alt="Examples of Sun's aerophotography." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1905/497398.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="1080" data-lheight="809" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Examples of Sun's aerophotography.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497401.jpg" alt="Examples of Sun's aerophotography." width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1905/497402.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="1080" data-lheight="1350" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Examples of Sun's aerophotography.The exhilaration comes from the creative process, pulling ideas together in the sky, trying different angles, editing, and wondering how the viewer will feel when looking at the finished product. The experience of shooting while hanging from the edge of an aircraft is not only exciting but also poetic because it’s probably as close to flying as I’ll ever get while at the same time ‘dancing’ and creating art. Since I’m a ballet dancer, too, the entire experience reminds me of my experience dancing La Sylphide.I’ve always been a firm believer of following your passion and do what you love. At the same time, take responsibility for your life, career and happiness. Never be afraid of taking initiatives..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}That ties in with my next question. Beyond living your own best life, you're also a strong believer in the power of philanthropy to make the world a better place. Explain why it's so important to give back, with a particular focus on getting more girls involved in Stem subjects. As a young woman and real-estate developer/entrepreneur, I learned to navigate my industry largely on my own, as an under-represented minority. As a result, I’ve always been eager to share my knowledge and experience with others similar to myself, and so my philanthropic mission is to encourage young girls to pursue careers and succeed in under-represented fields. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496368-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Girls4Tech programme aims to reach one million girls by 2025" width="120" height="120">Girls4Tech programme aims to reach one million girls by 2025First launched in South Africa in 2017, Mastercard's inquiry-based STEM programme Girls4Tech has so far reached more than 400,000 girls (ages 8-12) in 25 countries...14 May 2019I do this by acting as a positive role model and participating in non-profit-organisation projects that inspire young girls to pursue opportunities in Stem fields.I’m currently focusing on The Modern Women in Stem Book Project,, which seeks inspiring women leaders in Stem to contribute to a collective memoir. In that vein, I encourage female African business leaders and entrepreneurs to send their submissions to modernwomeninstem.com.I’ve also been a donor at Unicef for the past decade as aiding children in developing countries is a cause I hold dear to my heart. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}You're a successful real estate entrepreneur now, but have spent much of your earlier career as a multilingual broadcast journalist. Let’s take a step back and touch on some of the highs and lows of this leg of your career. I started interning at KTSF TV during college and was hired immediately afterwards. Because I am by nature curious and inquisitive, it was the perfect job for me at the time. Working in news enriched me and opened up broad areas of knowledge across a variety of fields. I had the privilege of meeting, working with, and learning from people from all walks of life.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1808/455317-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Giokos on the roof at CNN London." width="120" height="120">#WomensMonth: "Focus on your talents and ignore the noise"Eleni Giokos, CNN African correspondent, rounds out our Women's Month coverage by sharing her realisation that "career plus baby is doable",  as well as some of the noise she's learned to ignore, like being told to cut her hair short as long hair isn't 'corporate' enough...By Leigh Andrews 30 Aug 2018In addition, broadcast journalism is very fast paced. Part of my job was producing the evening headline news preview, and I had less than ten minutes to prepare the live, four-story headlines for the 7pm and 10pm news broadcasts.Within that short time-span I had to chase down footage from four different reporters, record two news-anchor voice-overs, edit the video, and add special effects. If I made a mistake, everyone would know, as my work was broadcast in front of a large audience.This experience taught me how to work efficiently and effectively and I discovered that repetition and memorisation were key. I routinely memorised and practised all the keyboard shortcuts in the software and hardware. This hard work paid off; soon I was able to do the job automatically and much faster than others – I think I got the idea from my ballet and fencing training!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}So interesting! Also interesting is that you say Wikipedia is your best friend. Explain the importance of having access to information at your fingertips and how this helps anyone with a desire to upskill themselves.Access to knowledge in the information age has made life-long, university-level learning possible and has greatly benefited me in terms of gaining knowledge and making decisions. I have a very curious mind so I'm always asking questions, taking classes, watching TEDtalks and learning about anything and everything. I like to keep up with many things: business, law, social issues, philosophy, psychology, technology, art, culture, travel, and anthropology. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1807/449851-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nelson Mandela image from" width="120" height="120">#Mandela100: Using the spirit of Ubuntu to address knowledge gaps on WikipediaWikimania 2018, held in sub-Saharan Africa for the first time from 18 to 22 July 2018, highlighted clear links to Nelson Mandela's legacy and how we can all help put African knowledge on top as Wikipedia aims to create greater knowledge equity into 2030...By Leigh Andrews 20 Jul 2018More importantly, I believe in informed decision-making and strategic execution in business based on thorough research. I always make sure that I have enough time to investigate, study and understand what I want to do professionally, before taking the necessary steps forward. All this wouldn’t have been possible without easy access to information. I think everyone should take advantage of this, adopt a growth mindset, and follow a path of life-long learning.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/445790-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Belchonock © –" width="120" height="120">#YouthMonth: Do's and don'ts to consider for lifelong learning"The most valuable asset you'll ever have is your mind and what you put into it." - Brian Tracy.
