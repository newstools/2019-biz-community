Two children, under the age of 13, could get into the Reserve for free, when accompanied by two paying adults...Brand Factor handled every aspect of the campaign, from strategy through to execution, as well as coordinating influencers and activation. Our team designed the flyers handed out by the promoters as well as the print executions in various Caxton community newspapers. Influencers were invited to an Easter bunny hunt at the Thatch Café (one of the restaurants at the Reserve) and shared the fun with their followers. The animal characters from the intersection campaign kept the Easter bunny company – add a very busy face painter, animal balloons as well as a jumping castle - and it was a day of epic chocolatey excitement. Brand Factor not only coordinated every aspect of the fun, we also bought the Easter eggs, hid them around the Thatch Café and arranged prizes for the kids who found the most eggs (the winner managed an impressive haul of no less than 44 marshmallow eggs – talk about a sugar rush). Our partners, Pink Vanilla, coordinated the influencers, all popular local parenting bloggers and Holla supplied our promoters who kept hard at work posing in their animal suits with hugely excited little people.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/498250.jpg" alt="Brand Factor puts Rhino and Lion Nature Reserve on the map - and rhinos and lions in the street" width="299" height="299" rel="">click to enlarge<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/498252.jpg" alt="Brand Factor puts Rhino and Lion Nature Reserve on the map - and rhinos and lions in the street" width="299" height="299" rel="">click to enlarge<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/498254.jpg" alt="Brand Factor puts Rhino and Lion Nature Reserve on the map - and rhinos and lions in the street" width="299" height="299" rel="">click to enlargeAs it turned out, not many motorists could resist a rhino in the road.
