It now has members (including many national associations) from the US, UK, Australia, Latin America, India and China.Modernising the brandThe new name, logo and other related visual materials were developed with the help of UK brand consultancy Heavenly.GLOBAL<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/478189-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Charmaine Moldrich, CEO of Australia’s Outdoor Media Association and Dino Burbidge, latterly director of tech and innovation at London creative ad agency WCRS." width="120" height="120">Judges announced for 2019 Fepe International Creative AwardsGlobal out-of-home association Fepe International has named the judges for its 2019 Awards: Creative, Lifetime Achievement, Leadership, Technical innovation and the industry's Rising Star...17 Jan 2019Heavenly CEO Richard Sunderland says: "Heavenly was engaged to help modernise the Fepe brand, ensuring it better reflected the unprecedented level of innovation that is now transforming the Out of Home sector.
