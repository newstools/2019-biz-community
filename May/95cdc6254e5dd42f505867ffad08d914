The jury will be screening entries for campaigns that rose above the clutter, had extensive reach and communicated via mediums that delivered on campaign objectives. The rigorous adjudication process spans three rounds during which submissions are judged against specific criteria including rigour, degree of difficulty, clarity of evidence, compelling case, and insight.“Winning an Apex award delivers evidence of the profession’s contribution to business success. It reinforces the value we provide as an industry and affirms our contribution within the context of the broader economy. This heavyweight adjudication panel is entrusted with identifying and bringing to the fore those campaigns that truly delivered on brand objectives and impacted the bottom line,” says Mathe Okaba, CEO of the Association of Communications and Advertising (ACA) Apart from being an essential business tool that affixes value to credentials for agencies, marketers and leading brands, winning an Apex award is a definitive demonstration that great ideas generate great results. Apex recognises the creative work that worked; the campaigns that manifested effectiveness in creativity that extends beyond words and pictures to creative intellect and intellectual property that is the currency of the profession.The 2019 Apex Awards jury: JudgeDesignationCompanyIvan MorokeChief executive officerKantar, Insights DivisionGareth LeckGroup chief executive officerJoe Public UnitedMathe OkabaChief executive officerACAAna CarrapichanoGroup managing directorMediologyDaniel NaidooDirectorGendel InteractiveFran LuckinExecutive creative directorGrey SAIsmail JoomaHead of strategyVMLJason HarrisonManaging directorM&C Saatchi AbelKagiso MusiGroup managing directorMeta MediaKatlego MoutlanaHead of strategyMortimer HarveyLeigh TaylerStrategic directorJoe Public UnitedLwandile QokweniChief strategic officerMEC GlobalMick BloreChief executive officerWolvesNatalie BothaCreative development directorKantar, Insights DivisionNeil HiggsIndependent consultantRetired ex TNS GlobalRefilwe MalulekeManaging directorYellowwoodRoxy MaqacheChief executive officerDesert ArabiaSu-Lise TessendorfGeneral manager: Brand, strategy and commsNando’sThabang SkwambaneManaging directorFCB, JohannesburgThulani SibekoChief marketing officerStandard BankTlalane NtuliChief operations officerYalu SAZayd AbrahamsHead of brandFNBWinners will be announced at the Apex awards gala dinner to be held at The Venue @ The Houghton Hotel on the 11 July 2019.
