More than a simple rebranding, the group has also consolidated all management and administrative functions, a direct response to the market's requirement for faster, leaner, more effective and agile service providers. The next generation marketing and media solution for marketers and brands is here - whether you work in marketing or media, the path to success is now the same: finding your most valuable customer or audience prospects cost-effectively wherever they may be, delivering valuable and engaging content or service experiences to them, and monetizing them through sales, subscriptions or advertising. "We have been building digital and mobile expertise since 2009, when MobiMedia launched as one of the pioneering 'mobile-first' agencies in the country. After acquiring the well-established online publisher, TEAMtalk media in 2012, we then added 2 more companies to the group in 2013 (AddSuite - programmatic media & performance marketing) and 2014 (HoneyKome - digital creative agency).  Since becoming an Oracle Gold Partner in 2015, we've been growing our team's data science competence in collaboration with Shinka." explains Tim Legg, co-founder and group CEO. Having transitioned from a loose collaboration of four group-owned companies within the digital media and marketing arena to an integrated digital media and marketing solutions provider operating under a single brand, OLE!CONNECT combines all the skills that brands and publishers need to succeed in the interactive world of digital media and marketing today, including the much sought after trinity of content, data and technology. In a digital environment where the worlds of media and marketing are rapidly converging, the company touts its solutions, services and skills as having the ability to help its clients master the convergence.
