The day kicked off with the vibrant East Coast Breakfast team, starting walkers off at Ushaka Marine World. Participants got to #WalkToTheBeat they voted for along the route while meeting, greeting and posing for a picture with some of their favourite presenters. Participants were met with the sounds of Freddy L and Holly Rey who upped the beat at the official finish line, Moses Mabhida Stadium, Peoples Park. East Coast Radio’s Station General Manager, Boni Mchunu, shared her proud sentiments of the day. “Wow! What a humbling moment for ECR as a brand. KZN came out in their numbers today and it is really heart-warming specially to know that we all walked with a greater cause in mind. It was an honour seeing so many happy faces and families enjoy our new evolved playlist who we owe thanks to our audience for choosing. We listen to you because you listen to us. We are glad we can be of service to our diverse province. "I would like to thank Discovery for being our official partners and for being world-class ones at that. Together we make a great team in aiding the needs of KZN and providing a healthier tomorrow. Thank you must also go to KZN for showing up and showing off. Thank you for your tremendous support. Here’s to next year and another 30,000 more!” said Mchunu. Again, this year the Big Walk was more than just a fun day out, it was the gathering of KZN to walk to something greater than themselves, the Sole2Sole initiative.The Sole2Sole initiative was founded by nine-year-old Dario Gouveia who was inspired by a barefooted homeless child who he saw on the side of the road. Dario felt confused as to why the little boy didn’t have shoes on, so he decided to give the child the shoes he was wearing. With the help of his mom, Zeta, Dario decided to start a Shoe initiative. “We are so overwhelmed with humility at the difference that KZN has already made by donating their pre-owned shoes. The shoes collected will be given some TLC and will then be distributed to various people in need. Thank you, East Coast Radio and the Big Walk, for using your platform to help those in need,” said an emotional Zeta Gouveia. "The Discovery East Coast Radio Big Walk is a firm favourite on the KwaZulu-Natal social and sporting calendar,” says Iona Maclean, Head of Experiential Marketing at Discovery. “We’re especially proud to partner with East Coast Radio in providing a platform for people to serve their community in practical ways while encouraging a healthier lifestyle for everyone in the process.” Whilst the day is a friendly family time out, some also took to the event as a great way to prepare for upcoming athletic races. The only timed race was the competitive 20km fun walk and the results are as follows: .kInstance-Body .kInstance-SubHeading{font-size:18px;padding:0px;margin:0px} .kBodyTableT table td {padding:5px;} .kBodyTableT strong{border:1px; font-size:12px;}.kInstance-Body .kInstance-SubHeading{font-size:18px;padding:0px;margin:0px} .kBodyTableT table td {padding:5px;} .kBodyTableT strong{border:1px; font-size:12px;}1st Place2nd Place3rd PlaceMaleSizwe NdebeleAron MahlanguVukani MdungeFemaleZelda SchultzNatalie LerouxLizette BothaWere you at this year’s Discovery East Coast Radio Big Walk and snapped a cool picture of yourself showing off your T-shirt and the beat you walked to?
