<img src="/c/1912/531701.jpg" alt="M&amp;C Saatchi Abel expresses its great sadness at losing the Heineken account" width="350" height="233">Jason Harrison, Group MD, who has navigated this account since it was awarded to the agency eight years ago says: “As an agency, we hold ourselves accountable for three things; helping our client grow their topline, their market share and their brand equity. On all the measures this relationship has been spectacularly successful.” Heineken has been the number one top beer brand in South Africa for the past three consecutive years (Sunday Times Top Brands Awards), with South Africa now a top-five market globally for Heineken, which reflects the exponential growth achieved. These achievements are astonishing considering the historic hold established South African beer brands have held on the local market. Harrison continues: “M&C Saatchi Abel are hugely grateful to Heineken for choosing our fledgling agency in 2011 shortly after opening our doors and could not be prouder of the contribution we have made to the business and the wonderful and trusted friendships forged over the years. We leave the brand in exceptional health and could not possibly have done more.”
