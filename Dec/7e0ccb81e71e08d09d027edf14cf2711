Thousands of children’s Christmas dreams will be realised in the next couple of weeks when The Santa Shoebox Project distributes personalised gift boxes with essential items and treats for underprivileged children throughout South Africa and Namibia. The initiative celebrates its 13th year of giving smiles to young people. Their ad campaign is aimed at showing kids that no matter what circumstances they may find themselves in, they can still dream and it will one day come true. For thousands of underprivileged kids who don’t know what it means to have a dream, this years’ Santa Shoebox Project is bound to have a positive impact.Unlike most big campaigns and TV commercials that feature in the #AfricanAdShowcase, the Santa Shoebox Project ad was a labour of love. When asked for credits, the Santa Shoebox team said this was a labour of love with a few sponsors involved to make it possible, and as such, there are no creative agency team credits to share.Below, we acknowledge the team that was behind this inspired piece of creative work.Agency and team creditsAd title: A Simple GiftCountry: South AfricaClient: Santa Shoebox ProjectCreative agency:  N/AAccount director: Roxy IlburyCreative director: Rob BairdExecutive creative director: Chris OosthuizenPost-production: Cynthia JonqueresIf you are an agency or brand with work that’s on TV, please tweet us on @OrnicoMedia and add #AfricanAdShowcase.
