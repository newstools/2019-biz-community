It is advisable to begin preparing your customers well ahead of the holiday and send a reminder closer to the holiday. We have put together some best practices to consider for driving communication: Signage. Consider the client that might walk by your store on a regular basis. Hang a sign on the entryway, window, or implement a digital signage system that easily updates this information, as and when you need to.
