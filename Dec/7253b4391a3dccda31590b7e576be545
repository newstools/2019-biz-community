As such, it revolves around 143 tops that cost the approximate of a new dwelling, each t-shirt featuring a front-facing printed graphic of one of 143 apartments at the condo development. T-shirt “D6-L7” clocks in at a tab of $1,049,000, while t-shirt “F2-L7” has a price tag of $5,500,000. But of course, if you buy one, you get a new home thrown in.Nature and urbanityThis is the fashion brand’s first foray into the world of residential real estate.

There are 13 individually-designed penthouse duplexes and maisonettes with private terraces. Cosmic swirls of liquid marble cloak the lobby, halls and apartment bathrooms.Bringing light into living spaces, the apartments feature gradient walls and discreetly-reflective surfaces that capitalise on the sun. Living spaces are rendered in varying shades according to their directional orientation. <img src="/c/1912/530666.jpg" alt="Diesel's most expensive t-shirts come with a condo in Miami" width="600" height="414">The symbiosis of nature and urbanity at Diesel Wynwood sees the building’s tropical greenery complemented by bold industrial materials of concrete, golden mesh, pipes and metal. Graffiti-etched cement walls recall the scene of renegade murals that define the artistic neighbourhood.Clad in black brick with minimalist wood screens and broad glass windows and a daring gradient finish on the structure, Diesel Wynwood reflects the warehouses of the neighbourhood in an avant-garde key.
