I recently called Kelz up for a chat about this spot. This is how it went:<img src="/c/1912/531725-625x351.png" alt="Coconut Kelz and Zandi Tisani talk Christmas with takealot.com" width="625" height="351">Zandi: Kelz, thank you so much for doing this interview. I imagine things must be very busy for you at the moment.Kelz: Howzit sgeb! Things are wild! It’s White Christmas season and Hanukkah for my other side of the family so as the party princess, I’m swamped. I take it you’re getting ready for Kwanzaa?Zandi: Well my family has a meal together on the 25th of December and people get gifts. I’m not sure what we’re celebrating.Kelz: That’s very nice. I also donate to my sisi and her family on that day. Charity begins at home. So I see you also have new work out?Zandi: A girls’s gotta pay her rent! We’re coming up to December which you know is like going to Mecca for South Africans. Speaking of South Africans. You’re becoming a household name, even moreso with your collaboration with takealot.com. How are you feeling about your future in fame?Kelz: Fame is just byproduct of me getting the truth out. However the more people that know me, the more Helen’s message…I mean my message..spreads across the country. You should know about fame being the most famous dark director?Zandi: LOL most famous dark director with breasts.Kelz: Even though I don’t quite identify, #blackgirlmagic is real. I must stress though,I’m only black on the outside. Zandi: Naturally. Of course we’d both love to take the credit for all of this but there’s an entire team behind this.Kelz: With a brand and agency as on the pulse of pop culture as takealot.com and M&C Saatchi Abel, the magic pair was bound to be brought together.Zandi: I don’t want to take up too much of your time. What’s next for Kelz?Kelz: I’m going to be on my first magazine cover next month! Can’t say much – just think “anyone can fly”. I’m also still touring the book and I’m currently on something so exciting I’m gutted I can’t mention it. What’s next for the Oprah of Steven Spielbergs?Zandi: More commercials and spending some time developing my long form work. I’d love to get a feature on it’s way next year, so I’m focused on that.Kelz: Well with that, SEE YOU WHEN WE TAKE THE LOERIE.View the spot here:Credits:Chief Marketing Officer: Julie Anne-WalshHead of Brand and Communications: Karla LevickBrand Manager: Tabitha van der Merwe Advertising Agency: M&C Saatchi Abel Executive Creative Director: Gordon RayCreative Director: Ntobeko XimbaCopywriter: Marguerite NelBusiness Partner: Rachel Du PlessisAccount Director: Bronwyn BlackhurstProducer: Sharon Martin Production Company: Arcade ContentDirector: Zandi TisaniManaging Director: Colin HowardProducer: Julia SchnurrProduction Manager: Marisa BracherUnit Manager: Cyprian Obase1st Assistant Director: Bjorn Van OsDoP: Rory O'GradyKey Grip: Ryan FaberGaffer: Clint StoneSound: Alan GerhardtArt Director & Wardrobe Stylist: Wendy FredrikssonHair & Make Up: Lauren SmitEditor: Joe de Ornelas @ Left Post ProductionsGrade: Terry SimpsonOnline: Ismaeel Williams
