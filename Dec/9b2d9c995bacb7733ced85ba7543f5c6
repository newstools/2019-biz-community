She also won a Loerie for last year's Ford Figo music video with GTB, along with a Loeries shortlist for Nando's (thanks goes again to M&C Saatchi Abel!). Last but certainly not least, Arcade’s co-founder, Lebogang Rasethaba, had the dream come true of telling Caster Semenya's origin story for Nike via Futura Joburg. The feedback has been incredible, including him receiving the director's craft award from IDidTht in November. Alongside a busy year in advertising, Lebo somehow also found the time to complete the final feature in his documentary trilogy with MTV - "The People Vs The People". “We are incredibly proud of our directors,” says co-founder and producer Will Nicholson. “And deeply grateful to the agencies and clients for trusting us with some of this year’s most important briefs. And of course nothing would be possible without our dedicated staff, crew, cast and suppliers.”  The Arcade team wishes everyone a safe and restful festive season and a prosperous 2020.
