It has come a long way over the past couple of years and is reaching a state of maturity now. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you think the industry can improve on?I think we can become slaves to social media channels if we aren’t careful. We need to know when a creative idea will have more cut-through if we go outside the norms of what everyone else is doing. Media algorithms are designed to tell us what is 'best practice' for reaching online audiences. But when everyone starts to apply the same guidelines, we only end up blending in because we’re all painting with the same brush.I also think we need to be more respectful of people’s personal information. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What's next and what are you most looking forward to?I’m looking forward to “what is next”. It’s such a dynamic space to be operating in and that’s what I love most about it. As more people gain access to digital devices and the internet in South Africa, I’m looking forward to seeing how we can improve their daily experiences.Connect with Carter on LinkedIn and for news and updates, you can follow Digitas Liquorice on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn or just visit the website.
