However, instead of convincing a person about whether or not to read an advert in a newspaper or magazine, now the headline convinces Internet and social media users about if they should spend time clicking through to the website landing page.Machine-life integrationComputers have become an indispensable part of our everyday lives. Think about the process of navigating in traffic. “In days gone by,” says Schneider, “if you wanted to navigate from A to B, you’d have to plan your route ahead using a map book. However, nowadays the process of navigation has become much simpler as all you need to do is plug your destination into your GPS on your phone.”We expect to have a seamless experience and when something jars us, we instantly abreact to it and put it in our metal discard pile. The same is true for advertising. “This means that for advertising to be seen as relevant, it is going to become increasingly necessary for advertisers to find creative ways of ensuring that people don’t initially perceive a piece as being blatant advertising,” says Schneider.The power of the storyIn order to seamlessly integrate advertising into consumers’ consumption of media, it’s going to be necessary for advertisers to constantly come up with new and creative storytelling ideas for their adverts. “This is because storytelling engages your audience and if they are engaged it becomes much easier to convert them into paying customers,” remarks Schneider.So to make your adverts stand out in 2020, adopt a bit of creativity and think about what story will take your advertisements to the next level! The Digital School of Marketing is an online provider of accredited digital marketing education which is accredited by the MICT Seta.
