Aware.org launched its new campaign with a message that suggests “Underage drinking starts long before it begins. You can stop it.” It raises awareness and highlights the dangers of underage drinking.In the ad, a teen named Sarah is part of #MyFirstDrinkingStory, where she goes to a club with friends on a night out. Her friend tells her to be cool as they queue to get into the club before security at the door asks them to show their identity documents. They proceed to enter the establishment and binge drinking ensues.Research by the Southern Africa Alcohol Policy Alliance (Saapa) found that 25% of young people binge-drink and 12% of young people under the age of 13 said they had drunk alcohol in the past month. In an attempt to curb underage drinking, South African government announced it is considering raising the legal age to consume alcohol from 18 to 21. A law that has not yet been amended.Teenagers are easily tempted to experiment with alcohol and to party all night. According to alcoholrehabguide.org, it can easily become a recurrent trend – a slippery slope for potential alcohol dependency.Agency and team creditsAd title: Aware.org - Underage Drinking CampaignCountry: South AfricaClient: Aware.orgAgency: RiverbedExecutive creative director: Bridget JohnsonCreative director: Mpumi Tshabangu NgwenyaCopywriter: Mpumi Tshabangu NgwenyaArt director: Mpumi Tshabangu NgwenyaProduction company: 03:07Post-production: DeliveranceRecording studio: Sterling SoundExecutive producer: Jo BarberMusic and sound design: Nic van Heerden of Field Music AgencyMedia house: MindshareProducer: Santa AsburyDirector: Kim GeldenhuisDirector of photography: Adam BentelEditor: Gordon MidgeleyIf you are an agency or brand with work that’s on TV, please tweet us on @OrnicoMedia and add #AfricanAdShowcase.
