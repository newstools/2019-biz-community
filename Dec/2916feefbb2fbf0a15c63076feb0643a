That's a lot of emails being sent every day by some 4 billion email users around the world. And while many of us feel like we're on the receiving end of about 1 million a day, at least, email isn't going anywhere. Particularly not for marketers and advertisers...By Jason Liebenberg 28 Nov 2019After reaching a major milestone this year with over 7 million subject lines checked to support global businesses across leading markets, SubjectLine.com launched this research, surveying more than 1,000 U.S. consumers, to take a closer look at impactful email marketing tactics. With holiday shopping predicted to be impacted this season from global tariff hikes, concern around anticipated consumer behaviour is at an all-time high. As such, email marketers are focused on how to rise above the noise, increase open rates and drive conversions with their holiday campaigns.  Key findings from the research include: Relevancy, consistency and personalisation are key - most respondents (58%) felt that brands targeting them through email, offering deals or coupons that are relevant to them, had a higher likelihood of purchasing. Moreover, half (50%) said that when they receive relevant emails on a consistent basis, they feel a stronger connection to the brand.Seasonal trends impact open rates – 64% of respondents indicated they are more likely to open emails from brands during the holidays with the top content they are interested in seeing including: deals/discounts (84%), holiday-themed items and décor (43%) and gift ideas/inspiration (39%).Single sales/offers drive more interest than multiple sales/offers – While sales will be a top tactic used by many brands and retailers this year, focus is key. The research showed that single sales or individual offers drive more interest than multiple sales and offers. The majority of respondents (56%) agree that they are more likely to open emails featuring a sale or coupon for a single item as opposed to an email featuring multiple offers.“As B2B and B2C marketers gear up for one of the busiest seasons of the year, email can be a powerful tool to raise visibility. Breaking through the holiday noise however can be a challenge” said Jay Schwedelson, founder and creator of SubjectLine.com. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507276.jpg" alt="Why email marketing is still the most effective way to build customer relationships" width="120" height="120">Why email marketing is still the most effective way to build customer relationshipsStrong customer relationships are built on trust, but how do you create and maintain personal relationships with thousands of customers?...Issued by Everlytic 18 Jul 2019“As we’ve analysed over 7 million subject lines to date, we know what it takes to improve your open rates and drive increased engagement. Focus is of the utmost importance. For B2C marketers, focus on what you want consumers to react to the most, make sure call to actions and offers are clear in marketing assets. B2B marketers can also capitalize on captive audiences during the holidays. Q4 is a great time to send ‘look ahead’ emails with rich content like whitepapers that speak to strategies for the coming year. In fact, these look ahead email campaigns can increase conversion rates as much as a 40% over other quarters.”
