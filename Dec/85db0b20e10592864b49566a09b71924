“We're very proud of our TBWA\ regional collective. In an interconnected world, we have made the power of collective - a strategic focus. We strongly believe that “none of us is a good as all of us”. What we can do for our clients when we tap into our collective learnings and creativity is truly outstanding. The work that made us regional agency group of the year shows what happens when collective power is applied to create local solutions,” says Des Jones, Chief Strategy Officer TBWA\South Africa.The TBWA\ collective walked away with the title of regional group agency for the second time in a row after collecting a total of 19 awards across 4 categories including a Grand Prix, 4 Gold, 5 Silver, 5 Bronze and 4 Craft Certificates at the 41st annual Loeries awards held in Durban during August.
