Tell us a bit about your experience in the industry; any other highlights you’re particularly proud of?Marc Lewis: I have been in the media industry for almost 17 years now.

To be at the Olympic Stadium and Maracana Stadium on those closing nights, is something I will forever remember.4.	Where were you born?Marc Lewis: Johannesburg.5.	What inspires you?

Watching Harrow, the detective series featuring Ioan Gruffudd. And I am currently listening to a podcast called Exotic Joe. 7.	What's the one thing that no one knows about you?Marc Lewis: If people don’t know it’s because I don’t want them to know.8.	What's at the top of your bucket list?Marc Lewis: To visit Lisbon on New Year's Eve and experience their fireworks display. It is one of the most impressive in the world.  9.	What is your mantra?
