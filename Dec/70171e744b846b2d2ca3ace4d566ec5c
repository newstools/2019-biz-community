Nineteen stores later, Decimal and Krispy Kreme are going from strength to strength.“It’s great when you can grow with a client, especially when they are open to new ideas,” says Raffaele Mc Creadie, Managing Director of Decimal Agency.Handling project management, strategy and social media management, Decimal has already worked extensively on the brand with their various limited-edition launches, and most recently, a highly anticipated store launch in Greenstone Mall and Canal Walk. According to their Marketing Specialist, Kayleigh Cameron, “Krispy Kreme is growing and thriving, so it’s really important for us to work with reliable partners who can keep up with that growing demand."With various digital platforms, including a website and an app, as well as a very engaged and responsive audience on social media, Krispy Kreme is a challenging yet energising client with endless potential.
