The electric atmosphere was also reminiscent of a super club, as four well-known trainers led the crowd in back-to-back high-energy, 30-minute workouts to the soundtrack of loud, rocking beats. Energetic workoutsIt all kicked off with a bang as enormously popular Mapule Ndhlovu (better known by her Instagram handle @QueenFitnass) exploded onto the stage accompanied on the decks by DJ Nikiwe Nyembe. Her workout started off gentle, but she soon had the crowd doing high kicks, jumps and screaming in delight at seeing their idol in action. Next up, iconic Pretoria-based fit couple Angelique and Jacques van der Linde of JVL Lifestyle led a thumping session that combined aerobics-style training with power moves inspired by boxing. The night hit a new high as urban fit crew Fitness Icon took to the stage with a hip-hop inspired dance class that had the crowd in a frenzy. To end the night, the Cape-Town based team from SWEAT 1000 led a massive finale that left everyone drenched and riding high on endorphins. Prizes up for grabsOfficial hydration partner Monster Energy kept the crowd hydrated throughout the night. During the breaks, there were plenty of sponsor activations to explore with prizes up for grabs. Clere gave away four large wellness hampers, which included a Pilates mat and a bag, as well as self-care products from Clere. Estēe Lauder offered make-up touch-ups and kept people fuelled with nourishing smoothies. The Go Multivitamin wheel of fitness gave people the chance to win prizes or do fitness forfeits like burpees and skipping. And with everyone working so hard on the floor, Fry’s vegan kasha smoothies were the perfect high-protein snack.
