Gone are the days where it was acceptable for service providers and agencies to not be right on the cutting edge of relevant industry technology and trends, alongside the customer.Better, smarter, fasterIt is also evident that customers are taking inspiration from global leaders in their fields – particularly in the telco and IT space – and are incredibly up-to-date on how the bigger, more established companies are embracing technology. For example, customers will not only know what the likes of an Amazon is doing, but also what systems they’re using to work better, smarter and faster - and they want to replicate that. This means that they’re already looking at how to implement the tech, rather than simply trying to understand it, so service providers and agencies need to be smarter, too.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/514079-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Luke Chesser on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">3 data trends shaping digital marketing in the next 18 monthsDatacore Media MD Grant Lapping outlines three data-related trends that will change the game for brands over the next year to 18 months...By Grant Lapping 30 Aug 2019In the past, customers used to do research only at the start of the purchase journey, as a way of finding the right partners who could help them plot a path of digital disruption. Now, this research underpins every stage of the digital purchase journey. The volume of content they consume sees them much better-equipped at the point of making the digital decision.

Agencies need to ensure that they’re always sharing the latest information with customers and becoming their partners, not suppliers. The agencies who are leading the charge are those who are able to impact the decision-makers at every point in the purchase journey.Current and credibleIt’s now up to the agencies to make sure that they’re always working hard to ensure that their information is current and credible. The information that agencies supply needs to not only mirror, but supplement the information that customers have unearthed on their own. If there’s a conference, go together. Learn together. Drive the process as partners. The upshot of this collaborative style is that the industry is moving forward – and faster than ever before.In terms of ensuring that relevant content is shared with clients, LinkedIn is an invaluable tool.

Lastly, there’s a balance to be found in terms of managing your intellectual property – positioning your agency as an expert vs giving away information for free. The key is showing value and welcoming customers and potential customers in as partners. Show, don’t tell – or you may just ‘help’ your way out of an account.
