More than just a technical supplier!" width="625" height="417">If you simply require a few screens, a projector and microphones then an AV company would suffice, but for larger, more detailed events, the use of a production company would be advised.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/530085.jpg" alt="Mstarr Productions... More than just a technical supplier!" width="625" height="417">We, at Mstarr Productions, have blurred the lines just a little. While we remain focused on our core business strengths in the technical solutions division, we like to ensure we provide as much value as possible for clients and have developed a comprehensive supplier network for auxiliary event services which may be required. So whilst we don’t claim to provide the services in-house, nor do we attempt to do elements in which we are not specialists, we consider ourselves a production company in the fact that we aim to provide and enable event solutions for our clients.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/530079.jpg" alt="Mstarr Productions... More than just a technical supplier!" width="625" height="443">Why choose Mstarr Productions? Planning and productionEvents - specifically larger, complex events – may require multiple suppliers and providers just for the technical aspect of the event (think pyrotechnics, laser displays, live entertainment and so forth). Our team leaders will ensure a single point of contact to oversee your event and coordinate with the various suppliers to plan and strategise the most effective and cost efficient solution for your requirements. Need suggestions for entertainment or audience appropriate speakers? Contact us! Integrated approachAs opposed to working in silo’s, we believe in working hand in hand with event suppliers and production companies to ensure maximum impact. Whilst we all have a specific function to perform to make the event a success, we believe in working together to exceed expectations. Allow us to design lighting that amplifies the ambience the décor provides or design the stage that ensures event proceedings run smoothly. Contact us for input on effective event coordination.  Design creative contentWe all know the phrase “death by powerpoint” which any conference attendee (and AV company) can attest to. Often in this instance, less is more – except when it comes to impactful content and graphics that add to the event atmosphere. At Mstarr Productions, we have the benefit of experience and in-house specialist knowledge to guide and assist with content development that both achieves required objectives whilst adding to the desired event ‘look and feel’. This can include show graphics, signage, looping monitor content, presentation templates, lighting displays, running order management and so forth. Contact us for 3D renders of proposed set designs! Detailed and customised production planThis relates to the full event program as the sound, lighting and AV is a critical component of almost all event elements. Allow Mstarr Productions to make recommendations for timing control, show flow and ways to enhance the overall delivery of the program. Throughout the production schedule, we’ll keep the team on task with their deliverables so you can rest assured the running order will be seamless. Contact us for production planning assistance!
