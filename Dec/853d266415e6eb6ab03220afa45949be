The Loeries Official Rankings are a useful and independent measure of who’s doing what across the region and provides an objective and credible representation of performance across the whole of Africa and the Middle East. The Loeries is also the only award across Africa and the Middle East that informs the global WARC Creative 100, a showcase for the best creative work in the world. CEO Andrew Human adds: “The Loeries Official Rankings remain the definitive measure across Africa and the Middle East for brands, agencies, production companies and individuals working across the design and advertising industries. It is the only comprehensive index for the industry that allows an oversight of what’s happening in this region, which makes it very useful when determining agency and brand performance throughout the region.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/530108.png" alt="Xolisa Dyeshana" width="250" height="362">Xolisa Dyeshana2019 sees Joe Public United being ranked the number one agency in the Overall Ranking by Agency – Africa and the Middle East - for the second year in a row.

My aim is to grow my team and business, and my hope is that this will help us build momentum.””We are just incredibly excited to get this recognition for our work,” adds Pretorius, “and the value of being recognised across the Middle East and Africa is almost immeasurable!”Turkish communication designer Önder Sakıp Dündar was ranked the top designer. “The bonds between design and advertising are getting stronger day by day,” he reflects. “It’s because agencies and brands have realised the importance of design – giving them a face, boosting visibility, driving conversations and reinforcing messaging.” Full information on the Loeries Official Rankings can be found on loeries.com as well as rankings for previous years.
