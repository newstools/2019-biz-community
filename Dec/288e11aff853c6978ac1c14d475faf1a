But I attribute a lot of my growth to saying ‘yes’ to tasks that would normally daunt me. When I’m confronted with a tricky task and feel stretched, is when there is usually a fundamental shift in the way I think which is both scary and thrilling. This drives me and has equipped me for pretty much anything. I am also surrounded by a team of talented experts who have all contributed in some way or another to my personal growth. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you most looking forward to?I’m looking forward to assisting in driving Liquorice into this new phase of data/tech-enabled experiences. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s at the top of your to-do list?

I’m also chipping away at my mother’s doctoral thesis on Exploring Communication Pedagogy, which is super interesting. And I’m an avid podcast listener: anything from Tim Ferris, Jordan Peterson and Malcolm Gladwell. In addition to Revisionist History, Gladwell has another audio project with music producer Rick Rubin which I love. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us something about yourself not generally known?Back in 2006, I did my internship at the Weinstein Company in Los Angeles. I worked in the motion picture music department putting soundtracks to film. Not only did I get to go to many a music concert and festival (which I attributed to research), but I worked on Tarantino’s Kill Bill 2, the Nanny Diaries and the Oscar-nominated Bobby – about the assassination of Robert Kennedy. I met a few interesting people, not to mention the infamous Harvey Weinstein.Connect with Worth on LinkedIn and for more info and updates, visit the Digitas Liquorice website or you can follow the agency on Twitter or Facebook.
