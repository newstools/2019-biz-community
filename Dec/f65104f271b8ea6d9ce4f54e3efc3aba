As we all know, you cannot fix something if you don’t know it is broken. The same goes for saving money. You can’t save money within an organisation if you do not know how to save it. <img src="/c/1911/528865-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Measurement Month: How are your communication efforts measuring up?" width="120" height="120">Measurement Month: How are your communication efforts measuring up?It is so important that the whole business sings from the same reputation hymn sheet to build a strong and positive reputation. Here are 14 compelling reasons why reputation research matters...By Regine le Roux 27 Nov 2019There are three clear advantages to measuring your reputation:1. Quantification: The percentage rating proves the extent to which people want to do business with your business and how much they trust your offering. If your organisation has an excellent reputation score, it shows that you have a good relationship with your stakeholders and that people want to be associated with you and do business with you. 2. Identification: We help businesses to measure the strength of the relationship with their stakeholders and help them to identify what is building or hindering current relationships. Through this research process we find ways for the business to build even closer connections with their stakeholders. Our research has proved that there is a clear relationship between a positive reputation score and a healthy bottom line. 3. Recommendation: ‘Data dumping’ isn’t what we do. We will provide you with practical solutions to take your reputation to the next level. Before saying ‘No’ to research, consider the following analogy: would you say ‘No’ to servicing your car? Taking your car in for its annual service is key to identifying possible problem areas before they occur in order to have a safe journey, save you money and to prevent you from incurring unwanted costs. The same goes for your organisation: don’t wait until your reputation is broken beyond repair before trying to fix it. Conducting research not only assists organisations with identifying possible problem areas, but helps build on the strengths that already exists within the organisation. Conducting research on an annual basis can drive your reputation forward.
