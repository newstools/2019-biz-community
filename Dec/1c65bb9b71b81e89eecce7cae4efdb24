The winners, who hail from all nine of our provinces, participated in a rigorous series of development workshops, aimed at upskilling them, with the end goal of making their creative ventures a reality.<img src="/c/1912/532170-625x474.jpg" alt="MC Rorisang Thandekiso" width="625" height="474">MC Rorisang ThandekisoHosted and facilitated by TV personality, Rorisang Thandekiso, the event included an inspiring performance from Siphokazi Jonas (the Western Cape Winner) at the event, and the DAC's Senior Manager for Arts & Youth Development, Mr Moleleki Ledimo, shared the importance and value of the programme to the packed venue, bringing particular attention to the alumni and various opportunities available to them.North-West winner Rehilwe Mooketsi said, “The programme has enabled me to articulate a creative and entrepreneurial direction, which is meaningful for myself and my community back home. The obligation the programme has put me under – as an individual and an organisation – to account for the financial activities, accept responsibility for them, and to disclose the results to the funder, has set me up for the future. As I’ve realised that accountability is central to the problems in the local music sector, through the mentorship programme I’ve developed a strong characteristic of accountability and discipline. I’ve become accountable, not only towards myself, but to others, and the sector I am reimagining.”
