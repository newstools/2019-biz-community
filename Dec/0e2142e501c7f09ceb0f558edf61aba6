It starts on 25 November and ends on 10 December, but some ask if it’s enough and whether we can afford to act so slowly.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/528473-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#16DaysofActivism: Can we afford to be acting so slowly?" width="120" height="120">#16DaysofActivism: Can we afford to be acting so slowly?16 Days of Activism is an annual international awareness campaign that starts on 25 November and ends on 10 December, which is also Human Rights Day...By Marc Lubner 26 Nov 2019Awareness alone cannot create change; actions create changeBecause recent statistics have proven we still need to stand together all day, every day to turn the tide. There’s no denying that femicide is a global problem with devastating impact, but we feel it more intensely here in South Africa. We have one of the highest rates of sexual violence in the world – a problem that is likely understated because crimes of this nature tend to go unreported.Added to this, about 3,000 women in SA were murdered in 2018 – that’s one every three hours. The World Health Organization (WHO) confirms it's more than five times higher than the global average.Just running an eye over the local trending hashtags in this regard is a chilling snapshot of the current lack of safety: #MakeitSafe #Enoughisenough #AmINext #JusticeForNene #iamNOTnext #WomenDontOweYouShit #StopKillingUs #FemicideinSA         View this post on Instagram           We use this day to voice our outrage, our fear, our anger. There will be many hashtags, and powerful posts and sentiments today, and we wish the citizens that have taken to the streets  are safe, respectful and respected. Though we will all continue with business-as-usual tomorrow, we will not forget. These tragedies should start a national conversation and provoke a shift in consciousness. We must do better, we must be better. ∙ ∙ ∙ #ItStartsWithYou #WeAreHer #BeThoseMen #AmINext #NoToGenderBasedViolence #JustNo #EnoughIsEnough A post shared by  Whaam Concepts (@whaamc) on Sep 5, 2019 at 3:48am PDT Clearly, more needs to be done, not just said – fast.So it’s especially fitting that we pay attention to this year’s #16DaysofActivism theme, which launched at the end of November: #OrangetheWorld:  It’s not a case of “all words, no action”, as many have already raised their voices to join protests to fight back for our safety.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515505-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Trending images relating to the #AmINext hashtag and the much-shared pic of the protest march outside Parliament on 5 September 2019: ." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Stepping up to keep SA's females safeLocal media covered the general sense of unrest and discomfort in the country last week, following the spate of femicide cases that spurred the nation to say #Enoughisenough and ask #AmInext?

It’s a hard-hitting, impactful activation for People Opposing Women Abuse (Powa), that comes with its own national flag and anthem, which demands the nation’s full attention. Banking on behaviour changeThe sentiment has proven so strong this year that numerous behaviour change campaigns took root before the #16DaysofActivism, such as SA-based #ItStartsWithMe crowdfunding campaign, launched by Wesley Mathew, Meltwater’s head of marketing for UKI and India, in association with Brothers For Life. The campaign aims to raise R100,000 for programmes that seek to help change male-held beliefs and attitudes that contribute to violent behaviour against women. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/520784.jpg" alt="#FairnessFirst: Taking a stand against GBV with Brothers For Life and #ItStartswithMe" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Taking a stand against GBV with Brothers For Life and #ItStartswithMeWith last Friday seeing the #InternationalDayoftheGirlChild celebrated, there's no better time to find out more about the #ItStartsWithMe crowdfunding campaign - launched in collaboration with the SA-based behaviour change campaign, Brothers For Life, intended to impact gender-based violence in the country...By Leigh Andrews 14 Oct 2019On the backlash around the #MenAreTrash hashtag and why it’s so important for men to take a stand and not take offence when females say they don’t feel safe, Mathew says: First off, I understand that no one likes being called "trash" on a personal level – but, as with any statement, it needs to be viewed in context. South Africa is wounded, and that hashtag is the symbolic representation of a lot of pain, frustration and fear all rolled into one. To me, #MenAreTrash is a clarion call for action on the part of men – not an attack on my character as a person. I think guys need to employ empathy here, and recognise that this is not an assault on them, but rather the symptom of a nation that's deeply hurting.Imagine what it’s like, being a woman for a day...That hurt runs deep, as the #EnoughisEnough survey run by Cosmopolitan earlier this year found that 89% of female respondents have been sexually harassed by men.

We all deserve a chance to define ourselves, shape our identities, and tell our stories. The film crew that worked on this piece was almost all women. Feeling their support and creating together was immensely healing. We should all be creating space for survivors to speak their truths and express themselves freely. When society nourishes instead of blames, books are written, art is made, and the world is a little better for it.

Imagine if we did something like this: We need to share our experiences, support survivors and do what we can to end the scourge. Our women and girls are the future.
