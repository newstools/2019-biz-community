"You find different points of aesthetics within the surface of the sacks' fabric", Mahama said. "I am interested in how crisis and failure are absorbed into this material with a strong reference to global transaction and how capitalist structures work."

If you can apply paint on a canvas, why can’t you work with an already existing object that has paint applied on it? I use my training as a painter in exploring materials that have a significant history and memory – sometimes at the stage of neglect – which is very relevant to production systems, especially within modern-day history."Intensive dialogueHis specific engagement with the conditions of Ghanaian trade has led his intensive dialogue into some of the most prestigious art conversations of this generation. And in doing so he has defied the traditional teaching and art’s intrinsic value as he uses the coal sacks as a device to explore process, material, value and meaning within the artistic system.The expectation of the art world is rapidly changing and Mahama’s intention is to break away from traditional art practice that he had been taught to do within an art school. In his own words, "We need to propose new forms and also constantly expand the sensibilities of both art and the world at large."Mahama will be speaking at the 25th Design Indaba Conference, which will run from 26 to 28 February 2020 at the Artscape Theatre Centre in Cape Town.Ticket sales for the Design Indaba 2020 are officially open.
