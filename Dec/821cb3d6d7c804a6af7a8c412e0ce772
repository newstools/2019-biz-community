The advertising and communications agency went up 19 spots to be the 29th agency in Total Awareness (spontaneous and prompted); another 12 spots up to be ranked 26th agency for Creativity (original and effective); and was ranked 16th Most Ideal Agency – up 15 spots.Karabo Songo, Group CEO at Brave Group, says that the rise in rankings is testament to the Brave Group philosophy and approach to creative communications, advertising, and the management of client relationships.“We’re a relatively younger advertising group and since 2017, Brave Group has grown to include the inception of specialist divisions and expertise as part of our offering. The report also shows that our leadership team includes some of the most admired persons in creative and advertising. We have truly punched above our weight when we look at the company we keep in the top ten best Agency Performers, and in the other categories.”The Scopen Report was compiled after conducting 222 interviews and analysing 460 client-agency relationships in South Africa between May to September 2019. Brave Group’s House of Brave also received the Scopen Report certificate for the attribute of its Integrated Services Offering and is the agency most valued by its clients according to the Agency Scope 2019/20 Study.César Vacchiano, President & CEO of SCOPEN, says, “In SCOPEN we see how globally independent agencies are reinforcing positions and gaining more and more business. House of Brave is one of the agencies that has improved the most in the last wave of Agency Scope in South Africa.”“They’ve gained positions in all of the attributes clients evaluate and rankings we produce taking into account all marketers’ interviewed perceptions. Integration is one of the most desired attributes by client companies (both marketing and procurement) and House of Brave is the only agency most valued for its ‘integrated services offering’, something very difficult to achieve.”Since 2017, Brave Group has reached significant milestones in its journey towards strengthening its pride as the “Lions of Hyde Park.” This includes achieving a Level 1 BBBEE certification, the appointment of Andile Khumalo as Group Chairman, Karabo Songo’s appointment as the Group CEO, and filling in key leadership positions in the group’s strategy and creative teams.As one of South Africa’s largest independent marketing and communication groups, Brave Group has also strengthened its overall integrated marketing services through the integration of House of Brave, Rogue, Bravado, Motherboard, and Whippet – all independent yet connected businesses to provide holistic communications solutions to clients and the industry.For more information on the Brave Group, please visit bravegroup.co.za and follow us on Twitter and Facebook for updates, and profiles of our team, and the great work we are doing.For more on information on SCOPEN and the Agency Scope in South Africa 2019, please visit https://scopen.com/en.
