He will be responsible for the overall editorial oversight of the Group. This is a well-deserved promotion for Salie, who this year celebrated his 40th anniversary with Independent Media. Of his appointment, Salie said: “This is an awesome responsibility and one I very much look forward to. We are at a crucial point in our young democracy, and the media has a vital role to play in ensuring its progression. I am hoping to do my bit to support the democratic project, by inculcating an environment of ethical and fearless journalism as well as leadership among the team here at Indy.   “Our aim is to build bridges within, and between, communities, in order to create a strong and united South Africa and I believe that Independent Media has what it takes to do this.” Yogas Nair, current editor of The Mercury, has been appointed to the position of Deputy Editor-in-Chief. Nair will work alongside Salie to ensure the quality of the editorial content of Independent Media’s publications, as well as upholding and maintaining ethical and balanced reporting across all the titles.  “I am humbled by my appointment and thankful for the opportunity to make a meaningful contribution to the editorial policy of Independent Media. I look forward to the work that lies ahead, as well as working alongside Aneez Salie,” commented Nair.   Siyavuya Mzantsi, will take over the reins from Salie as the Editor of Cape Times. Mzantsi is the first black African editor of the Cape Times in its 143-year history. At 26, he is also the youngest editor in the Group. “This is a great honour for me. Aneez Salie has done an incredible job with the Cape Times and admirably paved the road ahead. I am proud to have been under his wing and leadership.   “I am looking forward to the challenge and I’d like to thank my colleagues for their ongoing support. There is no other newsroom like the Cape Times. Our philosophy of ‘each one, teach one,’ separates us from the rest," said Mzantsi. Melanie Peters has been promoted to the position of Editor of Weekend Argus Sunday. Peters has held the position of acting editor for the past 19 months during which time, she has shown her dedication to the publication and its readership. She says of her appointment: “I am honoured to continue to work with a good team of journalists who seek the truth, are the voice of the underdog and tell the stories of our communities, and who do not blindly follow the general consensus. I will always aim to seek an authentic narrative.” Independent Media executive chairman, Dr Iqbal Survé, extended his congratulations to Salie, Nair, Peters and Mzantsi: “These appointments and others the group has recently made, are a reflection of our ongoing dedication to our business ethos of transforming the South African media space, which seeks to include youth, gender, diversity in the conversation. “We are incredibly proud of our homegrown talent. Siyavuya’s appointment is very well deserved and I would like to thank Aneez Salie for the role that he has played in nurturing a great pool of talent in his newsroom. Melanie has performed incredibly well, and her appointment is a reflection of her skill and dedication. Yogas’ strong leadership and her dedication to her craft have made her the perfect candidate to support Aneez, who is one of our stalwart editors, in his new role as Editor-in-Chief. I have complete confidence in the leadership of these new appointments,” said Dr Survé.
