How? 35-year-old Devin Sinclair, CEO of Mr D Food, says the transformation relied on speed, prioritisation, simplicity and a high-performance team.Here, Sinclair shares the strategy behind the digitalsation journey for others hoping to emulate its success.1.       Make the right decisions from the startThe new Mr D Food was predicated on:•	Building all the new technology from scratch;•	Changing the structure of the business to align with what the technology could power.The biggest problem with the old Mr Delivery business was service. The new Mr D Food cut delivery time by more than half, to an average time of 34 minutes. This called for a massive technological step change for all three sides of our business – customers, restaurants and drivers. "We made the game-changing decision to go app-only for our customers and be cloud-based, with a microservice model to allow for scalability. These were controversial decisions at the time, but we were able to look ahead and forecast what foundations we’d need to facilitate our hypergrowth phase. Today 95% of all orders are placed on our mobile apps," says Sinclair.<img src="/c/1912/529784-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Darth Kitchens aims to build SA's largest 'virtual kitchen' network" width="120" height="120">Darth Kitchens aims to build SA's largest 'virtual kitchen' networkDarth Kitchens, a new dark kitchen operation by some of the brightest minds in SA's food space, has launched its first 400sqm purpose-built, state-of-the-art facility in Cape Town...3 Dec 20192.       Test, learn and fail fast"We were given three months to bring a minimal viable product to market. We used learnings from the old system to inform our design. The company has always had a culture of test, learn and fail fast right from the start. Everything has been about speed, detail and data. "We are a business that’s obsessed with analysing everything we do. While we’ve never shied away from big strategic step changes, we also don’t let any of our business aspects stand still. Small movements on a number of things all add up over time. We’re constantly looking to iterate and improve where we can."3.       SimplifySinclair says the challenge is always to simplify – what’s the simplest thing you need to do to move a project in the direction you’re envisioning? "The success of our business is defining the minimum building blocks of each iteration. Prioritisation is critical. Strategy is important, but speed, prioritisation and simplicity are key to getting things done."4.       Get the structural business strategy right"There’s no way food delivery can be done, on the scale we do it, at the level of service we do it at, without technology at every step in the process. However, getting the right structures in place was equally important. We needed internal and operational support teams for our customers and restaurants. We also developed a hybrid, franchise model, whereby our network of owner-manager franchisees manage our drivers across the country," he explains.<img src="/c/1708/408076.gif" alt="Homegrown business Mr Delivery gets a bold and bright brand makeover" width="120" height="120">Homegrown business Mr Delivery gets a bold and bright brand makeoverMr Delivery partnered with M&C Saatchi Abel Cape Town to create a new, more dynamic look and feel to coincide with the launch of their app, Mr D Food - Delivery & Takeaway...Issued by M&C Saatchi Abel 28 Aug 20175.
