I live in Morningside, work in Sandton and hang out anywhere around Joburg. 2. What’s your claim to fame? I can outlast anyone at our company socials. 3. Describe your career so far. I worked in traditional agencies on above-the-line campaigns and TVCs, about 9 years ago I made the full move into digital, and started focusing on the emerging mobile app space in 2012. I was a little early on that I think, as not many brands were ready to commit to apps yet.4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. Without a doubt, my kids and my family – I love being the “cool” uncle to my nephews.

It’s my ultimate escape and unwind time. It allows time for me to do a lot of reflection, and it’s also the only time I can sit still for more than 30 minutes.Another lesser-known fact about me is that I’m a total documentary nerd. However, one documentary is usually split up into 15- to 30-minute intervals, because of my aforementioned inability to sit still for very long.5. What do you love about your industry? People. We have such a great mix of talent, with such incredible skill across our teams here.          View this post on Instagram           Brief: Re-create the most iconic selfie of all time. Nailed it... Kind of? #selfieday #agencylife #doitfortheculture A post shared by  Arc Interactive (@arcdigitalco) on Jun 21, 2018 at 5:03am PDT I love working in an environment that has so many different perspectives and approaches to the work we do.6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. Every day is pretty different, which I’m very thankful for. I love interacting with people – I’m rarely at my desk. Typically, I’m catching up with someone in the agency, or meeting with a team for a quick update and to offer guidance on projects they’re working on. I do quite a few client presentations, which I really still enjoy.          View this post on Instagram           Here's a #tbt of us in our zone during a brainstorm session.

What are the tools of your trade? Definitely the internet. I still jump in here-and-there on UX and UI projects, because my love for it means I don’t think I could ever completely remove myself from that process. Love Sketch. Love Zeplin.   8. Who is getting it right in your industry? Joe Public Connect’s stuff is always pretty cool, they’re really good at getting things right because they clearly consider each aspect of the project. Most recently, while judging entries for an award show, their work was some of the most enjoyable to judge because it’s of a pretty high calibre.

Time to celebrate with some champagne! �� A post shared by  Arc Interactive (@arcdigitalco) on Mar 15, 2019 at 4:44am PDT 9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. Representation – I’d like to see more women and people of colour in senior, decision-making roles in the industry. There can also be more youth representation in these spaces. Arc is a small digital marketing agency based in Sandton that’s proudly 80% female, and made up of majority youth.10. What are you working on right now? Our new website and new brand identity. I’m also currently looking into different tech for personalised content at scale – automated stuff. <img src="/c/1904/490785.png" alt="CellCgirl wins Silver at 2019 Bookmarks Awards" width="120" height="120">CellCgirl wins Silver at 2019 Bookmarks AwardsCellCgirl walked away with a Silver Pixel at the prestigious IAB Bookmarks Awards last Thursday night...Issued by Arc Interactive 4 Apr 2019While our clients have ranged from brands within the health and beauty industry, to financial service providers and the airline industry.

Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. AI; cognitive services; personalised content – this one I also use, because I think it’s pretty cool; and automation. 12. Where and when do you have your best ideas? The best ideas could be anywhere. Lately, when I’m driving to work in an Uber, or typically after I’ve actually had a good night’s sleep. <img src="/c/1904/491338.jpg" alt="Luke Goller, managing partner of Arc Interactive, named New Gen judge" width="120" height="120">Luke Goller, managing partner of Arc Interactive, named New Gen judgeLuke Goller, who is the managing partner of Johannesburg-based digital marketing agency, Arc Interactive, was recently selected to be a judge in the 2019 New Generation Awards...Issued by Arc Interactive 8 Apr 201913. What’s your secret talent/party trick? I arrive late really well. 14. Are you a technophobe or a technophile? Easy – technophile. 15. What would we find if we scrolled through your phone? Uber, UberEats, Whatsapp, Reddit, Discord, and kids asking me for money – my own kids, that is.  16. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry?You need to be pretty tough. Be humble, be good at what you do, work hard and the rest will pretty much fall into place.
