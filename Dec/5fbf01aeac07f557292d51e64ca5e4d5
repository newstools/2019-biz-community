We are honoured to be coming on board to service the Bidvest Bank business in South Africa. I believe that our knowhow of the sector, our unique approach to strategy and creative, our truly integrated offering, along with our Vivendi partnership with Universal Music Group and Gameloft, makes us perfect for the job at hand. And with the leadership of John Davenport, we are poised to make a meaningful difference to the Bidvest Bank business.”“What’s incredible about the win is that Bidvest Bank as a business is very much like Havas in behaviour. The brand is a big business, yet it is agile and personable enough when getting things done, always asking if things can be done better. There’s a sense of ownership that we both identify with, and that is key to a successful client-agency partnership. We are looking forward to putting out some stellar work that will no doubt shake up the financial services sector,” said John Davenport, Chief Creative Officer at Havas South Africa. Jodi Raviv, Chief Marketing Officer at Bidvest Bank said of the appointment, “We are excited about Havas’ fresh approach to integrated marketing, and look forward to working with them to further build our brand. We are a challenger bank with an agile and unusual approach to banking and problem solving. We believe that with Havas’ similar approach to business, our brand and business will thrive with their guidance and expertise.”  Havas will be handling the brand communications, working hand in hand with other specialist Bidvest Bank-appointed agencies to push the Bidvest Bank business forward.
