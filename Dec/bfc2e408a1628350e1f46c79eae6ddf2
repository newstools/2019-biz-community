Where did you grow up and what inspired you to become a designer?I was brought up in a small village called Welverdiend in Bushbuckridge in the north east part of South Africa. Growing up I had no desire to become a fashion designer as Welverdiend is not a place where art and design are considered career options. Like most kids in my community, my imagination only allowed me to dream as far as going into a “secure career ” that will help generate enough money to stabilise poverty, regardless of whether you are good at it or even like the career. After studying electrical engineering for two and a half years and having a job I despised, I decided to go back to school and study something I’d appreciate. A close friend of mine suggested fashion because they liked the way I dress, and the rest is history.<img src="/c/1912/531894.jpg" alt="Credit:" width="600" height="577">Credit: Nicholas Murphy.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How would you describe the Katekani Moreku aesthetic?Katekani Moreku is a brand that accentuates out-of-the-box thinking and the countenance of inimitable individuality. It is bold and unconventional, not enthused by popular opinion. It is a modern representation of the SePulana culture and the decolonisation of South African fashion..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What drew you to be involved in the Cape Town Resort Collection this year?I was scouted by Gavin Rajah as a young emerging designer whom they would like to give an opportunity to, and I was happy to take up the opportunity..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Tell us about your Cape Town Resort Collection range. What was the inspiration behind your designs and fabric choices?The range is inspired by my SePulana culture and by the South African artist Walter Battiss’ method of borrowing elements from other art forms. As part of the traditional attire, the SePulana culture combines scraps of fabric and plastic material; I just used my imagination to create a modern attire for the SePulana culture.<img src="/c/1912/531895.jpg" alt="Katekani Moreku designs at Cape Town Resort Collection." width="300" height="625">Katekani Moreku designs at Cape Town Resort Collection.<img src="/c/1912/531896.jpg" alt="Katekani Moreku: A rising star in sustainable fashion" width="300" height="625">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}You’re known for your creative upcycling of materials. What sparked your interest in this, and why do you believe it to be a valuable approach in the fashion industry today?I gained an interest in sustainable fashion in varsity when I learned about fashion’s major contribution to pollution globally. Upcycling of materials is something that came naturally from the SePulana culture that I was brought up within, it just worked well with my love for playing devil’s advocate, and it allows me to be innovative and offer a different take on fashion. I believe with this approach we can retrace our steps to sustainable living, this helps recognise the importance of sustaining our African heritage and to limit the climate change catastrophe before it reaches an irreversible stage of disaster..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Your rise to success has been somewhat swift. What have been some of the highlights of your career so far?My goal was to be able to create a collection and tell a story through it, everything that happened after... everything I learned to create is a big highlight of my career. But to name a few moments that really stood out for me, I was happy to be one of the young designers who were selected and invited to attend the Condé Nast International Luxury Conference in Cape Town this year. I was awarded the Student Award at the Twyg Sustainability Awards and I also received a MEC Recognition Award for sustainable fashion from the KZN Economic Development, Tourism & Environmental Affairs. These awards reassured me that I am on the right track and I should keep doing what I do.<img src="/c/1909/517725-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#TwygAwards: A celebration of sustainable South African fashion" width="120" height="120">#TwygAwards: A celebration of sustainable South African fashionDesigners and brands creating innovative, sustainable work in South Africa's fashion industry were honoured at the inaugural Twyg Awards, held in Cape Town on Thursday...20 Sep 2019.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Who are some of your favourite local designers right now?My favourite designers probably change every day.

It is difficult to break through as a young designer if you are not exposed to proper channels where young talent can mature accordingly.
