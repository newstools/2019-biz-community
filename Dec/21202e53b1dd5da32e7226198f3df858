This bold step towards the future of customer service ensures customers have the best experience on their own terms,” said Kerry Ho, Makro’s head of digital marketing. Makro's Intelligent Assistant (iA) was developed by Feersum Engine, a product that allows brands to connect with their consumers on the device of their choice. To enable WhatsApp integration, Makro worked with global chat commerce company Clickatell.“Retail is currently one of the most competitive environments and ensuring customer satisfaction must be the number one priority for business leaders in this sector. The Makro team has already shown themselves to be trailblazers, ensuring they can meet and engage with their customers on the platforms of their choice,” said Clickatell co-founder and CEO Pieter De Villiers. Customers can connect with Makro directly on WhatsApp by adding 0860 300 999 as a WhatsApp contact.
