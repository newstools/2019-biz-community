What do you love about your industry? The ever-changing, fast-paced nature of it. It is constantly changing and evolving, it has a good blend of creative direction, design output, above- and below-the-line marketing, as well as the hustle and chase that retail provides.

I believe brands and teams get built from the inside out, so for me it’s vital to establish a clear vision of what we are building, the will power to be uncompromised in that pursuit, as well as building a high-performance team who trust each other and can get the job done. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/494822-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Why Levi's wants you to #UseYourVoice on Election Day" width="120" height="120">Why Levi's wants you to #UseYourVoice on Election DayDenimwear brand Levi's has approached some of the country's leading influencers to help increase voter awareness and turnout amongst young people...By Maroefah Smith 2 May 2019The culture, made up of leaders on a clear and exciting mission together, is what drives the external performance of any brand or business, and spending time and energy crafting that from the inside-out is the tool of the trade. 8. Who is getting it right in your industry? I believe brands that are pioneering and leading the way in terms of sustainability and transparency are doing a wonderful thing for the retail industry. They are shining a light on the process behind the product, the hearts and hands that innovate, and bringing to life the impact that certain unsustainable ways of manufacturing are having on the planet.If more brands can work that into their reason for existence, it will definitely shift the entire retail landscape in a positive manner.Zak Venter, the Creative Director: Fluence and the Founder of S.P.C.C talks to us about the Urban Customer. https://t.co/WjNQtAQdBy— SACSC (@SACSC1) October 25, 2018 9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. The forced and, in many cases, broken retail cycle – launching pure winter products in summer and having your first winter inputs drop in the height of summer to try maximise sales earlier and earlier. Non-seasonal brands with an all-year, sustainable product development and roll-out strategy are definitely the way forward to correcting this.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/530391-120x120.jpg?2" alt="How SA's online stores can manage the 'deadweight loss of Christmas'" width="120" height="120">How SA's online stores can manage the 'deadweight loss of Christmas'By the opening decades of the 21st century, businesses had adopted e-commerce stores, online advertising, and more recently, mobile applications.By Dr Thabang Mofokeng 6 Dec 201910.

Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself. “Less but better”, “focusing on efficiency-driven decision making”, “cutting out the non-essential” and “aligning the teams on having fewer, more strategic pursuits to lift the needle in terms of impact”. We are blessed with an abundance of mediocrity. And there’s a lot more data fear-mongering — companies with access to numbers scaring others to trust them.— Zak Venter (@venter_zak) May 20, 2018 There is just so much noise in terms of oversupply of product and content that everyone is experiencing digital and choice fatigue. This will need to be corrected in the market, to start offering the SA consumer a ‘real choice’.  Instead of being consumed with trying to figure out what the masses want, I keep reminding myself to start thinking about what the people who care want. They are two different things.The masses aren't listening because they are option-rich and time-poor. The people who actually care are going to choose to listen, and endorse and advocate for you.Start small, do things well, and go slow in order to eventually go big.12.
