As a result, we mingled on the roof of the ICIC Old Foundry building in the middle of Cape Town Startup Week 2019, and networked up a storm over a delicious breakfast before the morning’s ‘informal chat’ kicked off, with some of the most inspiring local entrepreneurial females of 2019. <img src="/c/1912/530547.jpg?2" alt="Speakers at the final Future Females founders breakfast of 2019, part of Cape Town Startup Week, included Catherine Luckhoff, Aisha Pandor and Katherine-Mary Pichulik.

Here in South Africa the picture is a little rosier, but not much – while the sector is certainly booming, Ventureburn’s Startup Survey results show that 4.5% of companies with major investment were founded or co-founded by women.

She’s thinking bigger and broader about the business than previously, such as in also selling cleaning products through their shop, and will be launching in Kenya soon.<img src="/c/1909/514610.jpg" alt="It's time for a spring clean with SweepSouth" width="120" height="120">It's time for a spring clean with SweepSouthIt's been five years since Aisha Pandor built up SweepSouth, the online booking platform for homecleaning...2 Sep 2019Pichulik started her business around the same time as Pandor, as a fashion and jewellery brand inspired by the African design space. They’ve successfully managed to scale and now export to international countries. Pfluegl said it’s good to showcase the highlight reel, but we also want to know about the biggest business challenge.

As hers is not a service- but rather product-based business, the ability to make things comes from her talented team. While they started off as a family, Pichulik had to formalise their way of work as they scaled rapidly. Payment term pain and choosing where to sellShe said it’s exciting to be taking orders from some of the world’s largest premium retailers like Bloomingdales, but the big guys’ payment terms are often a challenge. She shared that sometimes it’s so exciting to realise there is an appetite for your offering that you don’t feel you have the agency to choose where you want to sell, but it’s empowering to do so.<img src="/c/1912/530495.jpg" alt="Image from the final Future Females founders breakfast of 2019, part of Cape Town Startup Week.

All images © Future Females team.Pichulik also listed the ‘hairy and scary’ exciting challenge of having started as a singular CEO who for whom having an executive decision-making session often meant thrashing out the idea with herself and having bootstrapped the business, to recently taking on a co-CEO. Pichulik added that there’s great beauty in restraint and solidifying. In the social media age, we want quick solutions, to be that entrepreneur jetting around in just six months, we get deeply depressed if it doesn’t happen.

It’s not necessarily the best path to scale too quickly – try to “chill out and enjoy the process, don’t panic.”Luckhoff, a speaker at the first Future Females event, spoke of her latest entrepreneurial journey, in offering a cloud-based AI solution for retailers called 20Fifty, which helps companies migrate to the cloud and query their internal databases. All the technology exists, so it’s a case of rapidly prototyping and making it possible to scale.Know when to fold ‘em: No one tells you the steps to shut down a businessShe provided a personal take on her first year of business with this, her fourth business as well as the overlap of her business lowlight: She also ran recommendation-based music-streaming service NicheStreem, which she had to shut down. Everyone tells you how to start a business, no one tells you how to walk away, especially when it’s been very successful.Luckhoff said Nichestreem was a successful business that got bitten by slow payments, despite the committed team and users.

She’s completed courses through MIT and loves working in the cloud as it means your startup doesn’t have to deal with IP issues or pay to put bums on seats in the early days to get things done, which means you can put that investment where it matters most. <img src="/c/1004/48005-120x120.jpg" alt="Agencies, eat your own dog food" width="120" height="120">Agencies, eat your own dog foodPhew, the digital, mobile and social media space is certainly hotting up recently. There have been more announcements and moves in this space than you can shake a stick at. And, while this is all very exciting and it's great to see such buoyancy after 2009's doom and gloom, as a PR and communications consultant, I am feeling a touch of unease.By Catherine Luckhoff 19 Apr 2010Pfluegl asked about specific African challenges in the first three years of running a business. Depending on the business, the upside could be lack of competition and increased room to grow, but a challenge is likely access to great talent, like an understanding of machine-learning.The team is the most important aspect of any business, no matter how big it grows. You need people who buy into the philosophy, not just the free coffee.There’s a lot of hype on how to start things, especially here in SA where entrepreneurship is seen as the answer to the unemployment challenge, but it can be a  lonely space. Being a strong business leaderWhile the business world’s 30- to 60-day payment terms make it difficult for your business to thrive, if not survive, it’s staffing issues that will get to you more than anything.Non-entrepreneurs often don’t realise that when you run a business, it’s essentially a mirror to your own life, with a spillover of your insecurities and fears.After a particularly bad day, Luckhoff’s now-husband told her “They can’t take away your belly button or your birthday.”<img src="/c/1912/530499.jpg" alt="Image from the final Future Females founders breakfast of 2019, part of Cape Town Startup Week.

We grabbed some time with founder and designer Katherine-Mary Pichulik to chat about the art of creation.By Ruth Cooper 11 Feb 2016Pichulik reminds us that everyone’s journey is their own, but you need to be willing to show up in that space.On working with your life partner…On working with her husband, Pandor says she’s always been brutally honest on the journey as it doesn’t help anyone to sugar-coat it. Luckily, Pandor says her husband has a complementary skill set to her own and their personalities work well together. Before starting SweepSouth, Pandor was a scientist and management consultant, so she went from talking to cells in a Petri dish to addressing the business principles that are drilled into you to starting from scratch. Pandor says it can be difficult to separate your partner from the professional person, but it’s about being able to respect someone for their professional work and where their talents lie, it’s about knowing someone completely. <img src="/c/1708/407190-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#WomensMonth: SweepSouth's Aisha Pandor keeps on climbing" width="120" height="120">#WomensMonth: SweepSouth's Aisha Pandor keeps on climbingSweepSouth's Aisha Pandor has been named one of the top 50 most inspiring women in tech...By Lauren Hartzenberg 22 Aug 2017It would be difficult to justify the amount of time she has dedicated to SweepSouth if her business partner wasn’t also her life partner. She says it helps to have someone who knows exactly what you’re going through and can help you pull herself together and keep on going when things get tough, as we all have tough days.

Here's how your brand can improve on customer experience by following suit...By Leigh Andrews 17 Dec 2018Pfluegl also opened the floor to questions from the audience, who were appreciative of the honesty openness of the morning’s speakers as there’s "a lot of bullshitting" about the entrepreneurial process.It’s OK not to be OK, 247The hardest thing is admitting you need help and understanding that it’s OK not to be OK all the time.

Pichulik said to be conscious of building a business that suits your nature. Do you need routine or can you drop everything when a new challenge arises? What hours do you do your best work? Often, we build the boat but it doesn’t serve our personal good.

She adds that women who play up that aspect do a disservice to others. This doesn’t mean you can’t be feminine in business, but don’t use that to curry favour.<img src="/c/1808/452598-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: Code-switching and dealing with queen bees in the workplace" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Code-switching and dealing with queen bees in the workplaceThe negative impact of code-switching and tokenism, why females speak almost three times as many words a day as men and how to deal with queen bees in the workplace were hot topics at the most recent Future Females Cape Town morning session. Here's what you missed...By Leigh Andrews 13 Aug 2018Answering the question everyone wants to know: When to decide to drop your main job and go with your side hustle full time, Pandor and Pichulik said to be cautious as there are so many dynamics that play into this decision.Having a salary is more addictive than sugar, so set yourself a milestone goal, as you need to plan adequately before taking the plunge.While you don’t necessarily need three years’ salary saved up before you get started, you do need to keep your personal expenses low. Don’t up your lifestyle right at the start of your business, as it’s a long game. Pandor shared that she only moved out of her parents’ house again this year.The speakers concluded that you need to be ambitious in your thinking and don’t only look to raise funding when you’re desperate for it, as that dynamic can be toxic. You don’t need to invent a male co-founder to get that funding.<img src="/c/1808/452952-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The Future Females Cape Town team." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Celebrating the Future Females entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs and side-hustlersIt's a Catch22 - you either have an idea to start a business, the motivation to do something different, or the skills to multitask, but it's rare for those magical elements to all sing loudly at the same time...By Leigh Andrews 20 Aug 2018UK-SA Tech Hub was the main sponsor for this event.
