This was represented  in our creative and activation executions, highlighting areas in the Cape featuring a K - Sybrand Park, Plattekloof, Kensington, Tokai and Kenilworth (to name a few). We really wanted to celebrate our audience, Cape Town’s iconic suburbs as well as the inclusiveness in our on-air offering. Kfm 94.5 is a unique radio brand in the Cape and our diverse audience make-up allows us to speak and engage with all the people who call the city their home”, said Saskia Hickey, Senior Marketing Manager, Kfm 94.5. Hickey added: “Through this new brand campaign #KfmSummerFeels, we are celebrating the music that our audience loves. Creatively, we decided to build on the design concept of the last campaign  by adding the “K” to  highlight some of the key artists on our musical playlist for example, Beyonce Knowles, Kold Play and Black Coffee. We understand the power that music has to move people, lift spirits and create connections and through the campaign we are celebrating the Mother City’s love of music.”The campaign, currently in progress, takes a three-phased approach and is driven through above the line advertising, a public relations and influencer movement, social media, activations and on-air content.Phase 1: The Ultimate Ticket to Summer: Early November 2019A mini version of Kfm’s Big Red K moved around the city with the Kfm Crew and supported through on-air programming and social media.
