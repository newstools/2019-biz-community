At IAB SA, our chair and vice-chair, along with our board of directors, bring an incredible charge to drive this forward. Alongside their collective thought leadership and empathy to better understand the challenges at hand; their unparalleled mentorship to advise and nurture our councils, committees and task teams to deliver relevant and meaningful solutions; and their network and influence to activate strategy into implementation, the combination of Alistair and Claire’s experience to propel the industry forward through the power of digital, is an exciting next phase for the IAB in our country.
