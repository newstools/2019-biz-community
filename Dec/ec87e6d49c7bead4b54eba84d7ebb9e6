The campaign encourages Toyota fans to share their stories and the relationship people have with their Toyota, what they love about it and what it does for them, she said.The latest episode features a man – Leonard – so enamoured with his Toyota Land Cruiser 79 he goes by the name of ‘Cruiser Captain’, as well as the indomitable rap of Snooze who throws out some rib-tickling-but-only-a-Saffer-would-appreciate-them lines. For example, 'if my day was sucky, I just bakkie, and feel lucky’. <img src="/c/1912/531505-625x156.jpg" alt="Latest episode in #ToyotaStoriesSA campaign another winner on social" width="625" height="156">It was shot in the Fuelcontent studio with Executive Creative Director Tian van den Heever and Associate Creative Director Lucy Holford-Walker directing.

I’m not surprised its proven popular on social channels.” Van den Heever added that anyone who enjoyed the story about Leonard and his Cruiser, and wanted to view some of the other ToyotaStoriesSA, could visit:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGOs__Y_XMwhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RraapvcoVYghttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cCe7hCQaro&t=35shttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pcG-DDC6IXI Credits:Client: Toyota SABrand: Land CruiserSenior Marketing Manager: Tasneem LorgatManager: Social Media Community: Naniwe MthimkhuluCreative agency: FCB Joburg                Chief Executive Officer: Brett Morris Executive Business Director: Reagen Kok                       Executive Creative Director: Tian van den Heever                        Copywriter: Marvin Mboneni Mpanda; Mbeu KambuwaProject Manager: Ra’eesah BenefeldtProducer: Nakita Bolus                          Production house: FCB Joburg and FuelcontentDirector: Tian van den HeeverAssociate Creative Director – Lucy Holford-WalkerPost-production: Fuelcontent
