Well, if you have your list ready and want Santa to click and deliver then, like his milk and biscuits, you’d better make sure a festive email signature and branding campaign are there to get noticed!Online research will show that Santa could feasibly have had billions of elves helping him but official thought processes by none-other than ‘Elf Crazy’ dictate that there are in fact 6 (including none-other than Pepper Minstix – the office favourite).So to help you on your merry way, here’s our 7 ways a Christmas email signature and interactive banner campaigns can help you get Santa’s attention and get the holiday engagement you so desire. By the way, our 7th Elf is called 'Cam Paign Metrix'! (It is after all unofficial).Share the eggnog with a Christmas email signatureDon’t be an email signature Scrooge! It’s time to add some seasonal signature sparkle. Introduce some red and green colourways into your email signature design, perhaps some shimmering snowflakes or maybe treat your head-shot to a jaunty Santa hat.But is it wise to let your staff go Christmas-crazy, calling themselves Santa’s ‘Chief Help Officer’? Or similar. Far safer to use email signature software that gives you centralised control – and keep your naughty elves in check. Santa rests easy at night, knowing that his team’s branding is completely consistent, totally tamper-proof and appears perfectly across all devices.<img src="/c/1912/532542-625x130.jpg" alt="Santa's 7 steps to Christmas signature success" width="625" height="130">‘Tis the season to be socialIs your email signature all set for season’s social whirl? Make your signature key to your Christmas social media marketing by adding instantly-recognisable social media icons. Like with Santa’s magical delivery, with Rocketseed they’re automatically configured to link straight to your social media channels when clicked, so you can cost-effectively drive traffic to them with every Christmas business email you send. So whether you’re sharing Christmas deals, season’s greetings or a few shots of the elf Christmas party, it’s easy to send recipients straight to your social media from your Christmas email signature.Put “Season’s Greetings” right at the topWhile your Christmas signature gives you a seasonal sign-off, just like Santa your seasonal message deserves top billing! So for more immediate impact you need an eye-catching branded banner campaign. Whether it’s ‘Merry Christmas’, ‘Season’s Greetings’ or a more branded festive message, a banner campaign puts it right at the top of your email.<img src="/c/1912/532543-625x130.png" alt="Santa's 7 steps to Christmas signature success" width="625" height="130">Make an email banner campaign your Christmas marketing channelChances are, there’s a lot more to shout about over the Christmas period than simply “Season’s Greetings”. What about that fabulous Christmas offer? Late night opening at Santa’s present workshop? Or the early start of a spectacular sale? Get your customers directly engaged with any of these via a branded email banner campaign. With clear, clickable calls-to-action you can drive traffic direct to your online shop, booking engine or promotions page. And with Rocketseed’s sophisticated analytics you can see exactly who’s engaging with your email branding over the Christmas period, and which Grinchy ones haven’t!<img src="/c/1912/532544-625x150.jpg" alt="Santa's 7 steps to Christmas signature success" width="625" height="150">Closing for Christmas or open for business?This one’s self-explanatory but important nonetheless. For some, after Christmas it’s straight back to business, for other’s everything shuts down ‘til the New Year. Featuring holiday opening and closing dates in a banner at the top of your email is the ideal branded way to remind your customers, suppliers and partners in the run-up to Christmas. Far better than leaving them to find out via a chilly ‘out of office’ automated email reply.<img src="/c/1912/532545-625x145.jpg" alt="Santa's 7 steps to Christmas signature success" width="625" height="145">Drive Christmas donations to your chosen charityIf your business supports a charity, Christmas is the time to give it more prominence by featuring it on an eye-catching festive email banner campaign geared to driving extra donations. It’s the season of goodwill so, with a clear ‘Donate Now’ call-to-action button, recipients can easily click through to the charity’s own website or your own charitable donations page. After all Christmas is all about giving not receiving.Bring in the New Year with a brand new email bannerWith an interactive email banner not only can you wish your customers a Happy New Year but also get them engaging with your brand by clicking through to read your first blog post of the new year or your programme of events for 2020.Of course, nothing says New Year like New Year Sales, and an interactive banner campaign gives you a great opportunity to feature your best deals and link straight through to your online shop.
