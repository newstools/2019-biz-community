Music artist Zakes Bantwini said that the day was a true testament of the spirit of Ubuntu that is clear in KZN. “It was such a pleasure to man the lines and hear people pledge so cheerfully to this incredible cause. Whatever platform we get to make a meaningful change should be a platform well used. Well done, ECR, and well done, KZN,” Said Bantwini. Music sensation Patricia Lewis said that she was thrilled to be a part of the day. “Toy Story is an annual campaign that touches so many little lives. I am so honoured to have played my part this year,” she said. Marketing Manager of Toys R Us & Babies R Us, Catherine Jacoby, said that she was delighted that the day that has been much anticipated was such a success. “It has been such a beautiful day.
