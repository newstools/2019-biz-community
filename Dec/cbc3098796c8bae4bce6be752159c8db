Following the MBO, the founders are returning to the Netcash name and require a new identity as well as a communication and brand strategy.  Netcash, has a solid reputation and is a name the industry trusts, which is why it is returning to its original name.  Talking about the design, Boomtown Group Head, Jesse Skarkie, says: "The logo colours were inspired by the bright RGB pixels on a digital screen. Being a digital payment and integration brand, we thought that the digital world was a relevant representation here."  The creative team behind the CI played with the contrast and intensity, and through a thorough understanding of the brand as approachable and playful, we arrived at the lighter green, dark blue and pink colours for the logo. This also prompted the use of lowercase lettering in the logo. "This approach is unexpected and approachable to invite people to engage with the brand and to feel that they can trust the company. And that Netcash is different compared to its competitors and other financial service providers," adds Sharkie.  The n icon in the logo will also act as a copyright symbol for Netcash. This is the stamp they put on their work to demonstrate its confidence and places a message of work successfully delivered.  "In addition to the return to the Netcash name which holds considerable credibility, there is the introduction of a new strapline to reflect the brand evolution, Payments. Delivered," adds Boomtown Account Manager, Anina Pienaar.  Roll-out is expected at the end of Q4 of 2019.
