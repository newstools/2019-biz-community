When Just Design launched a separate branding offering late last year, we couldn’t have predicted how much traction Just Branding would gain in such a short space of time. Led by international branding Creative Director, Scott Clephane, Just Branding’s in-house expertise has no doubt elevated our local and international branding projects, as some of our most recent projects highlight:World-class branding for world-class wineWe have a strong legacy of developing world class wine labels and packaging for our wine clients. In this tough economy, it’s without a doubt the brands who invest in strong brand strategies and identities that are the ones who remain competitive and reap the best harvests. That’s why long-standing brand partners like the AdVini Group (France), La Motte, Leopard’s Leap, Stellenbosch Vineyards, Distell and Lanzerac trust us to help them audit their brand portfolios and strategies, applying unique design guidelines to define how each brand and varietal can best compete in local and international markets.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/529519-625x353.jpg" alt="Just Branding makes its mark" width="625" height="353"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/529520-625x353.jpg" alt="Just Branding makes its mark" width="625" height="353">Celebrating Montagu’s small-town valuesFor Montagu Dried Fruit & Nuts, a simple brand and packaging audit evolved into an exciting new proposition for the brand. Their small-town values and uncompromising drive to bring quality healthy snacks to their consumers haven’t changed. What has changed, however, is evolving the brand design identity to compete in a retail space and focusing that passion into an innovative stream of new tasty, trusted quality snacks. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/529521-625x353.jpg" alt="Just Branding makes its mark" width="625" height="353">Dream destination marketing designWinning the Visit Stellenbosch pitch this year was an absolute highlight. We’re currently working with key stakeholders in the region to help establish Stellenbosch as a sought-after global destination. In order to keep our inspiration for designing this new brand identity alive, we’re finding ourselves doing lots of mountain biking, hiking, wine tasting and eating out. It’s a tough life, but Just Branding is only too happy to live it. An antidote to large livingWhen a smart start-up team approached us with an opportunity to develop the brand identity and packaging for their ground-breaking hangover cure, we jumped at the chance. Our branding team love nothing more than creating a brand from scratch with a passionate and inspiring client who appreciates the power of great design. Look out for the aptly-named Recova in stores nationwide early next year. Luckily we have some samples for the morning after our year-end agency party. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/529522-625x646.jpg" alt="Just Branding makes its mark" width="625" height="646">It’s been a great year and we couldn’t have done it without the passionate, brave clients who entrust us with their brands. We’ve got some exciting new projects launching in 2020 that we cannot wait to reveal and we’re ready for year two of Just Branding’s success story.
