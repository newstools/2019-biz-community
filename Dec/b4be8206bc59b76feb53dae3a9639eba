Since brown is symbolic for the earth, it is only natural that green will start to grow from that current. The need for green is so powerful that it will turn around fashion and design without any doubt! Sprouting from different political, humanistic and survivalist sources, it is impossible to ignore.”<img src="/c/1812/474491-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#BizTrends2019: 6 Fashion and décor trends that are here to stay and slay" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: 6 Fashion and décor trends that are here to stay and slayIt's that time of the year again darlings. When I look at my social media comments, take inspiration from runway rages and peek into the mind of Li Edelkoort to bring you my version of what we'll be wearing next summer...By Kumari Govender 14 Jan 2019Green – both the colour and the concept – forms a pivotal part of Edelkoort’s summer 2021 colour forecast. She reflects: “Maybe the most important thing about green is its capacity to bring joy. Its energy and charisma are compelling and will help us be, combating despair with optimism and happiness: joy seen as another form of activism.”Critical turning pointEdelkoort’s message for the fashion industry is that we’ve reached the critical turning point and that sustainability is the only way for the industry to go forward.The second part of her talk will look at the connection between design, objects, and the most influential of lifestyle elements, food. “Taste is driving every aspect of our lives from homes to hospitality, from food to fashion, and from make-up to materials. The largest megatrend on our planet today must be people’s fascination with food, which is taking over our spending and inspiring all other interests.”During the seminar, she will explain how food continues to impact surfaces and interiors: “Indeed, kitchens are refurbished and enlarged, becoming the best place to be in the house, the room where everyone congregates to work, study, play and cook. Kitchen tools, tabletop design, pots and pans are conceived to better steam, roast, grill or bake foods that are organic, nomadic and authentic.New shapesFabrics play the game as well, with darker linens and printed motifs, as if designed for the sophisticated amateur chef. Fashion starts to play a role in the kitchen and aprons come co-ordinated with shirting and watches are designed for the exact measuring of minutes and the reading of seconds – essential for any successful cake or roast. All this adds up to new shapes for furniture, new textures for materials, new needs for architecture, and new adventures for the great outdoors - all impacted by the textures, flavours and colours that define what we eat.”As the annual trend seminar is usually sold out in advance, booking ahead is advised in order to secure a seat. Tickets are available through webtickets.The Johannesburg seminar takes place on 25 February 2020, while the Cape Town seminar takes place at the Artscape Theatre Centre on 29 February 2020 and starts at 09h00.For more:www.designindaba.com
