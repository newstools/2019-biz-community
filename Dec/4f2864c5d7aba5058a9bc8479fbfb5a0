<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1912/530176-625x325.png" alt="New African's list of 100 Most Influential" width="625" height="325" align="left">The December issue of New African magazine, the pan-African news magazine published by media and communications group IC Publications, once again features as its cover story the list of Most Influential Africans. Business leaders dominate this year’s listing with 28 inclusions. The list is broken down into eight categories including Arts and Culture, which has 18 entries, and Politics and Public Office which has 15 entries. English speaking countries dominate this year’s listing, representing 65% of all entries. Making the list is the recent Nobel Peace Prize winner, Ethiopia’s Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, as well as Alaa Salah, the 22 year-old Sudanese protester now referred to as Lady Liberty, a student of architectural engineering who became the face of the people’s revolution in Sudan that brought down Omar Al-Bashir. Two sporting heroes also make this year’s feature, Siya Kolisi, the first black captain of South Africa’s national rugby team, who were crowned world champions in November; and, unsurprisingly, Kenyan world record breaker Eliud Kipchoge, the marathon runner. The December edition has four covers: Amina J Mohammed, deputy secretary general of the United Nations; Tewolde Gebremariam, CEO of Ethiopian Airlines; Thando Hopa, model and activist; and Siya Kolisi. In the opening editorial note, the magazine calls this another vintage year and reminds us that events in Sudan and Algeria have shown that citizens have once again asserted their rights and put leaders elsewhere on notice that the people remain masters of their fate. The list, it argues, shows that “Africa is full of talent. What is more, this talent can and does travel – whether it takes the form of acting in blockbusters or fronting TV shows or winning literary awards – African talent is rocking the world.” The December issue of New African is available on newsstands in 75 countries and via the app store and the magazine’s digital channels.
