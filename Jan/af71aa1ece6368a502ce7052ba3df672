So if I called someone and said, “I’m going to murder you,” and then followed through, the case would remain that I’m the murderer, not the phone company through which the call was made.And yet, we’re asking our platforms to be something they’re not, while in turn our platforms are asking to be something they’re not, and we’re also asking our influencers to be something they’re not. Remember that the social media platform is just the dial tone, not the actual message. “But the question is, where do the Kardashians fit into the conversation?" Salzman said, taking a different angle.Influencer marketing: Cloudy, with a chance of KardashiansAre the Kardashians influencers or are they a media property? That’s where things get cloudy, when you rise to that level of influence. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/474822-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Bio-punks and the democratic DIY design of the human body" width="120" height="120">Bio-punks and the democratic DIY design of the human bodyIn August 2018 Kim Kardashian and Chrissy Teigen caused a social media frenzy when the posted pictures of themselves sporting what appeared to be body-modification "jewellery" implanted in their necks and torsos on their respective social media feeds...By Bronwyn Williams 14 Dec 2018Salzman said the problematic influencers are those who brag about their follower numbers:I have 20,000 followers, yet I can’t even get people in my own house to pick up their dirty dishes.That’s what makes her nervous for marketers. We’re doing something we’ve never done in the past. Before it was all about ‘cost per thousand’, but we seem to be missing standard measurement tools around social marketing. We need to be clearer on why we put our money in a specific platform, and how our money is delivered in order to better understand what we can expect next. Consumers become media, media becomes marketersAnother problem modern marketers face is that media agencies are becoming marketing agencies.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/478525.jpg" alt="#BizTrends2019: Facebook is the dial tone, not the message" width="625" height="417">© Yarruta via 123RFSalzman calls this a super trend of blurring. Every day people are becoming media, and media is becoming more of a marketing platform in a continuum of blurring. This means that as a marketer, you need to take a step back and say, “Here’s my message. Here’s what I need to get out. Here’s who I think is going to be the best transmitter.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477499-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Olesia Bilkei ©" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: Social marketing, and true word (of mouth) powerWhen Marian Salzman, one of the world's top trendspotters, invited me to discuss all things social marketing trend-related over coffee at the end of 2018, I jumped at the chance.

Too many customer segmentation reports are based on over-simplified, outdated data - just ask 'Bargaining Busi' and 'Premium Pam'...By Dali Tembo 15 Jan 2019Editorial content that comes with a byline still has the most credibility, because even if you hate what I say, you can see that I’m a real person, so you have an outlet for that hate. Salzman says, “In the world I grew up in, the journalism and marketing departments at a media outlet were so separate. Then came the advertorial phenomenon, and now advertorial is the new editorial, and editorial is all about amplification.” Amplify, amplify, amplifyMost of us know how to reach 2,000 people, but what if you want to reach 2m people? We need to decide on an amplifier to spread the message across other platforms.Ultimately, we use social media to amplify the message. But you can take that message and further amplify it to give it a lift, through the likes of Outbrain. That’s really the bigger social play. Good editorial these days is being paid to be served, so if the algorithms are strong enough, you’ll see the content.That’s where Salzman predicts the big marketing plays of 2019 will take place.Also read Salzman’s broader trends for SA and the world in 2019: <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/476466-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Global trendspotter, Marian Salzman." width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: Top 12 trends for SA and the worldMarian Salzman, one of the world's top trendspotters, shares 12 of the top trends to expect as we delve into 2019...By Marian Salzman 8 Jan 2019
