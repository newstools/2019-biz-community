This is because they deliver pre-written messages at customisable intervals, triggered by things like subscription events, birthdays, and once-off start dates. Workflows, on the other hand, offer the benefits of drip campaigns, plus so much more. Like drip campaigns, workflows allow you to send messages automatically at specific times and with strategic delays. But, when combined with conditional triggers and smart database management, workflows can also send messages based on conditions like the subscriber’s stage of the journey, their demographics, and their interaction with your mails; adapting and personalising the journey for different audiences.

Since then, Everlytic has made many updates and upgrades. These include: Workflow conditionsConditions are like if statements that decide where your subscribers fit into the campaign journey. Once your subscriber's actions or data meet a condition, they diverge into their respective paths in the Workflow to receive messages relevant to them.At first, workflow conditions were limited to the information available in your database. With the release of Everlytic’s Message Activity condition, however, you can now also adapt your workflow based on how subscribers have interacted with the previous mails in the workflow. For now, this includes whether a contact has opened an email or clicked a link within it.  Dynamic anniversary triggersEverlytic’s Dynamic Anniversary Trigger enables you to start sending your workflow messages before, on, or after a specific date, anniversary, or birthday – not just on the date itself. A nifty feature when you want to send a dedicated series of emails around someone’s birthday. Smart go-to actionsOnce your reader has completed a journey on your workflow, you can send them to another node using a go-to action. This allows you to continue the conversation on a separate, but related topic relevant to their subscription and saves you from having to duplicate content you’ve already created on another branch.  Workflow node reportsEverlytic’s advanced workflow reporting allows you to view detailed information about a contact’s journey through every node in your workflow, enabling you to track things like: The date subscribers entered the workflow Total number of emails and / or SMSes sent and received in the workflow The date subscribers completed the journey (if applicable)This reporting also shows each contact’s email address and mobile number, if they are in the system, and the date and time each message was sent to them.THE BUILDEREverlytic’s drag-and-drop builder is one of Everlytic’s core features.

The .ics attachment opens on most email clients, including those on mobile, and automatically adds the event to the recipients’ calendar when they accept.While there were many more Everlytic features released in 2018, these, Everlytic believes, were the most impactful.
