Nozipho Mbatha, Sasol Group Brand Marketing Manager, commented, “Sasol has been a supporter of women’s football for 10 years. We are immensely passionate about the game.  #Limitless is thus designed to use football as a positive catalyst to change perceptions and behaviours for positive outcomes.  We are humbled by the success of #Limitless and hope that it will continue to inspire South Africans in 2019 – with the FIFA Women’s World Cup on the horizon, the sport’s biggest year to date.” #Limitless is aimed at garnering more support for, and inspiring participation in, women’s football.  The initiative also aims at shining a spotlight on individuals involved in the sport.  It serves as an illustration of the powerful and talented people selflessly giving of themselves to grow the game.  According to the Activative Annual, “Throughout the last 12 months, the Activative team has looked at tens of thousands of campaigns from across the global sports landscape.  Only around 500 of these make it onto our case study platform.  So that gives you an idea of just what it means to be show¬cased in our ‘Activative Annual’ and to make it onto our list of the 10 Most Activative Campaigns Of 2018.  In a year of powerful women’s sports marketing #Limitless is a stand-out, meaningful piece of work.  The local female empowerment factor is strong, the work feels genuine and authentic, while the integration and commitment is impressive.”#Limitless features multiple campaign elements ranging from television and digital/social content, to a theme song performed by local artist Rouge, the creation of blue #Limitless shoelaces (created as a symbol of the campaign, challenging people across the nation to wear them as a symbol of their support for women’s football), plus an influencer campaign and an internship programme.“We are thrilled to be recognised on such a scale for our work on #Limitless but, more importantly, to have created a campaign for our client which is proving to be a real catalyst for positive change in the sport of women’s football.  I would like to thank Activative for this wonderful recognition and Sasol for their trust and support in the creation of this work,” Added Struan Campbell, Levergy Director.For more information on Levergy and for contact details go to Levergy.co.za or follow @levergy_sa on Twitter.
