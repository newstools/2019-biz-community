This entails ongoing dialogue between employees and managers on adding inclusion to their daily work, in small ways through accountability.That accountability is linked to three basic factors:1. Awareness, of the impact of others’ ideas on your own behaviour;2. Curiosity, in encouraging hard questions and open-mindedness; and3. Courage to put your beliefs to action.It may seem a simplistic approach, but McIntyre concludes:By encouraging employees to become engaged advocates for themselves and each other and providing tools like the shared core priority to track their journey, we're committed to ensuring everyone has a stake in owning our culture.That sounds to me like a company culture every business could benefit from in 2019.Disclaimer: Andrews also worked at Microsoft, many moons ago.
