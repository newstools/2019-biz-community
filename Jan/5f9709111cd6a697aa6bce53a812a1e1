Her mother and father were both journalists and political activists, which developed her perspective as an artist.She says her work has always been inspired by the writings of people like Biko and Fanon, Achebe and Nkrumah.My work gave me an opportunity to share my thoughts and have a meaningful conversation with my generation about 'blackness', 'Africaness', about some of the social ills that plague us, and also about freedom and joy. Music gave me an opportunity to feed my revolutionary self.Voice of SA’s conscious youthHer career started in 1998 with Bongo Maffin, called one of "the pioneering bands of kwaito". Following the success of the group, Mazwai became widely recognised as the voice of South Africa’s conscious youth. The Guardian has called her "South Africa's finest female contemporary singer".After five albums with Bongo Maffin, she ventured out on her own in 2004 and her first album, Zabalaza reached double platinum status and won numerous awards, including a Kora Award for Best African Female and four South African Music Awards, including Best Album. After her last studio album, Ibokwe (that went gold within a few weeks of its release in 2009), Mazwai told Marie Claire in an interview in 2016 that she was struggling to produce music. Getting the creative juices flowing"I became afraid of the sound of my own voice. I became afraid of creating. I experienced a spiritual block and went through emotional darkness for a few years." she said. This continued until a friend eventually suggested that she considers working on a jazz album, and when her long-time partner gifted her with pottery classes one Christmas. She says the block started to lift. "Pottery has been an interesting way of getting my creative juices flowing. There’s no pressure making pots. Nobody gets to look at it; only I do and I love it. It’s a calming, meditative practice," she says about the ukhamba (traditional Zulu pot) she made.Thinking about the future, she says on her website:I would like to play all over the world to new audiences and share my music and perspective. I also want to make albums that will merge the sound from my part of the world with the sounds of Mali, Jamaica, the jazz underground in the USA, Brazil, Cuba, and the Congo. I am also interested in exploring electronic music, dub and funk, even punk… I guess I want to do it all.Mazwai has performed across the globe alongside artists like Stevie Wonder, Paul Simon, Hugh Masekela and Skunk Anansie to name a few, and now she'll also feature on the Design Indaba stage next month.Design Indaba 2019 will run from 27 February to 1 March.
