<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477342.jpg" alt="OFM hosting Central SA's biggest charity golf event" width="440" height="330">The 16th edition of the Shoprite Checkers OFM Chip for Charity will take place at the Bloemfontein golf club and promises to be a fun-filled day of golf with clients or friends – all for a good cause.  There are also great prizes up for grabs. All funds raised will be donated to charitable organisations across Central South Africa.  At last year’s event R215,000 was raised, which was donated to Child & Family Welfare and Martie du Plessis School for learners with special scholastic needs. According to OFM General Manager, the Shoprite Checkers OFM Chip for Charity is a much-loved event on the Bloemfontein golfing circuit. “Chip for Charity has become a highly anticipated, well-supported event on the Bloemfontein golfing calendar. It’s a great day out for the golfing community in Bloemfontein and one of the most important fundraising events for OFM.  These funds have changed so many lives over the years and we hope that this year we can raise even more for charity!” Book your four-ball with Bianca de Villiers at bianca@redstaragency.co.zabRev('brev-5a0c7394-a9c0-4745-8201-054082adc19a', '>a/\<az.oc.ycnegaratsder@acnaib>"az.oc.ycnegaratsder;46#&acnaib:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
