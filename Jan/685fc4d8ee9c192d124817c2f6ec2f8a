Hot 91.9’s Breakfast Team, Mansfield in the Morning, were contacted by concerned listeners about this crisis situation urging them to step in immediately to assist the shelter at this critical time. “When we arrived at work this morning, our listeners informed us of what had happened, and even though the shelter is outside our broadcast area, in a crisis situation, we step in and do the right thing, and that is to help.” There is an immediate need for pet food, bedding, bowls and funding to rebuild the shelter. The Team are appealing to all corporates to dig deep to assist Purrpaws and contribute wherever they can. All corporates are asked to email their pledges to hotcares@hot919.co.zabRev('brev-a16aa890-e8f8-4477-8b7e-f79ea7e331a5', '>a/\<az.oc.919toh@seractoh>"az.oc.919toh;46#&seractoh:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<'). For all individuals who would like to contribute in their personal capacity, please go to www.Hot919.co.za for more information. At this time, we would like to thank our friends, The Courier Guy, who are assisting in all transportation of goods for this worthy cause. Our thanks go out to the Hot 91.9FM listeners - thank YOU for caring.
