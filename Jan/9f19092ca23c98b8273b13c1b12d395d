Locally, hip-hop stars such as AKA, Casper, Kwesta and Ricky Rick have discussed the challenges of the music industry, and how they have had to find other means of becoming successful. Now the question then becomes if consumers have changed the way they consume your product i.e. music, shouldn’t you as the artist then try to adapt your revenue model to grow where you are in comparison.Market focus – United States of AmericaTo look at this from a numbers point of view, in the United States of America (biggest consumption destination of the year), the music streaming market is $4bn, revenue is expected to show an annual growth rate (CAGR 2018-2023) of 3.5%, resulting in a market volume of $4,957m by 2023.

Is the cost of data, it has been well documented and investigated, the cost of the service is not the issue, but the associated costs which inhibit ordinary consumers from engaging with the product?
