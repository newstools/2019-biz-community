I would like to congratulate Clint and his team and wish them the best of luck for 2019.” Nedbank follows on from a number of new business wins in the final quarter of 2018 for Levergy.  In addition to existing clients Sasol, New Balance, SuperSport, BBC and The Jag Foundation (pro bono), 2019 will also see Levergy as the lead sponsorship agency for Energade.  The agency’s communications team was also appointed by the Mzansi Super League and Tennis South Africa to execute their PR and social media and by WWE as their PR representatives in South Africa.  The experiential division also executed two events for LaLiga in South Africa at the back end of 2018. Levergy CEO Clint Paterson said, “Levergy’s growth over the past year is something we are immensely proud of and a testament to our team.  We are delighted to welcome Nedbank to the Levergy family.  They have one of the most impressive sponsorship portfolios on the African continent and as such, we are humbled by the confidence they have shown in us in entrusting this portfolio to Levergy.  We are hungry to work alongside them to take their properties to the next level.  I would also like to acknowledge our current clients; their trust in Levergy and continued support is a key factor in the industry-leading work we as an agency continue to produce.” For more information on Levergy and for contact details go to Levergy.co.za or follow @levergy_sa on Twitter.
