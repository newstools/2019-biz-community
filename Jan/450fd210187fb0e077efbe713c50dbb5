The big lesson from China is that this ecosystem is revolutionising online sales by making it as easy as possible for e-commerce to happen.

To sell and to grow.Here are four more trends, which can also be embraced as strategies to ensure that influencer marketing works for your brand.2. Where’s the bottom line?Influencer marketing is currently faced with recessionary market forces. Clients want to see ROI. Metrics used in the past — like reach — will not be attractive unless these are directly linked to better business returns.3. Better metricsTraditionally marketers and advertisers have used reach as the dominant metric, and this may work in traditional media. But digital is a whole different ballgame; new technologies and algorithms provide more sophisticated measures, deeper insights and more targeted analysis. It’s no longer about audiences, but it’s all about how influence happens in networks.4. Focusing on networksInfluencer marketing 1.0 was nothing more than celebrity endorsement. Version 1.1 was the rise of the Youtube stars, whose celebrity status was created by the influence they wielded. Now we’re talking influencer marketing 2.0, where technology allows us to identify tiers of influencers within social networks, in the form of groups of individuals who naturally engage with certain brands. Now brand owners can form personal relationships with those influencers and create tightly focused campaigns using their networks.5. Rise of the new influencersAt a certain level, expect to see influencers become involved in the creation of products, especially as manufacturing becomes more streamlined. With shorter runs of bespoke products, for example, influencers can tout their exclusivity, while brands can grow their social cachet. Specialised, exclusive events that revolve around influencers and their networks serve the same purpose.
