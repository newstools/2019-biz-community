Here's what you missed...By Leigh Andrews 13 Aug 2018We teach people how to treat us through our interactions with them and politics is rife in the business world, so Mannel says you need to continuously be conscious of that.Mannel expanded on this, saying you also need to be able to sell your solution and make people want to work with you. So speak with authority and confidence when selling an idea. The caveat is that if you make a mistake, you need to own it and fix it quickly as that’s how you build integrity. Speaking of speaking to others, Mannel said not to forget the value of networking with peers and the rest of the industry.You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. This is something to seriously consider, as the people we spend the bulk of our waking hours around are often not in line with our own aspirations, which waters them down. Being around people with the same passion is what will help you grow, so be mindful of who you spend time with.Mannel concluded that the relationships that last – whether personal or career-wise – are the ones based on shared values. When to speak up...Customers remember both what you promise them and what you deliver, as well as how the experience measures up to that. So we need to put more emphasis on managing their expectations.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1401/171584-120x120.jpg" alt="Time: How have you spent your 525,600 so far?" width="120" height="120">Time: How have you spent your 525,600 so far?If you subscribe to the old adage, "Time is money," then belated congratulations are in order!

She says if you don’t feel comfortable in the situation, that’s the time to speak up.Ayanda Seboni, group executive of brand, marketing and communications at PPS, adds: When you’re given a seat at a table, own it in full, own your voice and share your perspective. Often, it’s not an angle others have thought about, but if it’s a good idea they will listen to it.Don’t be afraid to make yourself heard, especially if it’s something you feel passionately about. Speak for your work and don’t expect it to always speak for you.An important reminder as we start the 2019 work year.
