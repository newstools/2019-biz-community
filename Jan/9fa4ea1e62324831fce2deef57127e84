But don’t be too quick to put your marketing eggs in that funeral basket. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1501/253328-120x120.jpg" alt="[Trends 2015] Newsflash: TV will not die" width="120" height="120"> Newsflash: TV will not dieEvery year, someone predicts the death of TV ads. They claim the evidence is everywhere, from rising digital media consumption to the increased popularity of the PVR. The only thing is that no one seems to have told TV...By Stu Stobbs 26 Jan 2015Salzman says while Facebook has become something that most of us wish we hadn’t let happen, we’re unlikely to see its death anytime soon.There’s a great debate today around data privacy, but we all effectively surrendered our privacy to Facebook in exchange for the social platform becoming our personal online archivist.So even if you don’t use Facebook regularly, it’s still the digital keeper of the last decade of your life. The founders opened it up to non-university students in 2006, so some people effectively have up to 13 years of personal history stored there. They’re not going to just give that up. Or are they? Only time will tell.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1805/439687-120x120.jpg" alt="#AfricaMonth: The digital life expectancy of Africa's youth" width="120" height="120">#AfricaMonth: The digital life expectancy of Africa's youthAfrica's new digitised youth population, Generation Z, will define Africa's digital future and these are the skills they will need to do it...By Louise Marsland 8 May 2018Take a moment and try to scroll through your own Facebook history – it’s mind-blowing what we’ve posted over the years. And while we smile at some of the Facebook memories that pop up from years ago, some make us cringe and think, “Oh wow, why did I post that?” Power of (Facebook) attorneySpeaking of the death of social media, Salzman says we’re seeing a new fad where family members fight over who will take over the reins of the Facebook pages of the deceased. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1508/305993-120x120.png" alt="[TrendTalk] Death.

She remembers thinking it was a ridiculous concept at the time – surely people wouldn’t want their photos online as a memorial to their bad behaviour and bad choices? <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/479794.jpg" alt="#BizTrends2019: The death of Facebook? Not quite. Meet the social media of the future" width="625" height="613">© via 123RFBut fast-forward to early 2019 and she admits to missing the boat there, as she didn’t envision Facebook, as it was originally created, would become a family-reunion mechanism, and totally cross-border, so we can be in touch with people on every continent, in relative real-time.Salzman says she also should have seen that Facebook Messenger would take off, given the success of AOL Messenger in becoming AIM and instant chat. While there doesn’t seem to be much stickiness to the platform, some have gotten into it. Speaking of lack of stickiness…Snap today, gone tomorrowWhen it comes to ephemeral content platforms like Snapchat, there’s a generation that obviously loves the product and lives on it. That’s why Salzman says:Brands are panicking about it because they don’t know how to use it – they don’t have the know-how or even know where to get in, and it’s where the youth market spends their time. It’s also completely counter to real life because advertising messages must have staying power, yet with ephemeral content, it’s ‘Snap today, gone tomorrow’. The very idea of ephemeral content goes against the definition of marketing.Yet ephemeral content is everywhere, so clients ask for ‘Snapchat strategy’ then complain that it has no stickiness – it’s the chicken or the egg. You just can’t have both, at the moment. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477388-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The story behind social media Stories" width="120" height="120">The story behind social media StoriesStories enable social media users to share short, fun, and cool pictures and videos of them with their social media friends and followers, with the video disappearing automatically after 24 hours.

It’s the likes of Tinder. She explains:As an advertising medium, it works as it’s transactional, so based on the very idea that consumers are already there to swipe what they like. I see that becoming the new media portal, and the bulk of advertisers are not there yet. But to me, dating platforms are incredibly important as media. People go to the app and check it fifteen, twenty times a day. So you can use it to reinforce messaging, especially as something that’s really changing our world is campaigns. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1506/288260-120x120.jpg" alt="Swipe right for success: secrets from the 'rad' Tinder founder" width="120" height="120">Swipe right for success: secrets from the 'rad' Tinder founderLessons on rethinking everything and marrying human connection to technology, right from Sean Rad, president and founder of dating app Tinder, as shared at Cannes this weekend...By Ann Nurock 22 Jun 2015<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1712/421362-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The World’s Most Eligible Bachelor campaign." width="120" height="120">APA results: Kenya's thriving advertising industryThe fastest and most affordable connectivity in sub-Saharan Africa enables Kenya to punch well above its weight in the IT sector generally...4 Dec 2017A campaign used to last a year or two, now the length of a campaign is effectively the amount of time it takes you to find someone on a dating platform.
