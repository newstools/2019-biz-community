McLaughlin’s surprise that Woolworths had apparently copied her design was therefore understandable. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/476897-120x120.jpg?3" alt="Woolworths accused of copying baby carrier design" width="120" height="120">Woolworths accused of copying baby carrier designWoolworths has once again been accused of plagiarising the product design of a smaller business. This time, the item in question is a Woolworths baby carrier, which entrepreneur Shannon McLaughlin claims is a copy...1 day agoLook beyond marketingMcLaughlin also alleges that the retail giant went further than simply lifting her design. The entrepreneur also accuses the retailer of buying Google Adwords keywords related to the names of her baby carriers.

From a completely impartial point of view, Woolies responded very quickly to the social media tsunami surrounding its use of a hummingbird design. Its response was also plausible.By Chris Moerdyk 22 Oct 2013While taking all these steps can seem complex, especially for a small startup simply looking to grow their brand, it’s often a matter of bringing in the right outside expertise from time to time. Get it right and you won’t just stay ahead of the competition, your brand will grow to previously unseen heights.
