MegaVision Media used their spaza shop footprint in Gauteng and Eastern Cape to execute the campaign. We printed and installed the bold Pocket and Bar fixtures on stand-alone poles as well as mounted onto shop walls. The results were astounding - a bright and vibrant campaign that really stood out over the festive season and certainly made a statement.
