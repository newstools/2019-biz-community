I’ll be stepping into a CCO role, and a large part of my role will still involve creative leadership.”Terry will invest most of his time leading our creative department, building a formidable and future-fit creative team, creating meaningful and effective work, and decorating our entrance hall with shiny statuettes.“We’re currently carving out our own niche and DNA in a very competitive industry. Terry brings a fresh perspective and a wealth of experience to help us build our vision for The Odd Number. Ultimately, though, we want to see our work compete at a global level and believe Terry is just the partner to help get us there.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/468770-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Molefi Thulo, Sibusiso (Sbu) Sitole, Peter Khoury, Glenn Jeffery and Jonathan Deeb." width="120" height="120">The One Show 2019 selects five top South African creatives as judgesThe One Club for Creativity announced that five South Africans have been selected to serve as judges for The One Show 2019...13 Nov 2018“He’ll also be a huge support strategically for our business.
