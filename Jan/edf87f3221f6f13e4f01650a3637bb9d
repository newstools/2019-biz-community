Reminding people of these Life Before Uber moments form the basis of Grey’s new campaign for Uber. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477336.jpg" alt="Grey takes us back to a Life before Uber" width="480" height="240">“The proposition is a simple one – we take it for granted that Uber is always there for our convenience but this wasn’t always the case. By contrasting these two worlds – one with Uber and the other without, it was Grey’s primary objective to ensure that we land the client’s brief of reinforcing the trustworthiness and reliability of Uber,” says Fran Luckin, Chief Creative Officer at Grey Johannesburg. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477337.jpg" alt="Grey takes us back to a Life before Uber" width="480" height="241">Through radio, television and a range of nostalgically designed billboards, people are reminded of the cringy, embarrassing situations that simply don’t happen anymore, thanks to the ride that’s always just a tap away.
