The month includes an exciting, diverse line-up of jazz tailored to all ears, from seasoned jazz connoisseurs to those who have not yet engaged with the art form. Collin Kgari, host of Kaya FM’s Sunday Evergreens Soul & Jazz show says, “Jazz originates in Africa and has evolved in different ways across the world. Yet the root of the sound remains African and is intertwined with the history of our diaspora. It’s only fitting that Kaya FM, Home of the Afropolitan, pays homage to jazz in this month.”Kaya FM’s focus on jazz has developed significantly over the last four years. From a simple Sunday show, to dedicated playlists across the station’s line-up.Musically, Jazzuary travels through time and across the world, from jazz’s origins in the African-American communities of New Orleans, to Bebop, Kansas City Jazz, Swing Jazz, Cool Jazz and Free Jazz, to African and South African jazz variations, such as Cape Jazz and Marabi all the way to present day styles such as Latin and Afro-Cuban Jazz. While the playlist is constantly evolving, some of the masters featured in the past include Andile Yenana, Pianist and Educator; Paul Hanmer, Jazz Pianist; Zoe Modiga, Jazz Vocalist; DJ Kenzhero, DJ & Curator and many more. “We recognise jazz as an art form, and something to be engaged with on an intellectual and soul level,” says Greg Maloka, MD of Kaya FM. “For us Jazzuary is a lifestyle and reaches beyond our playlist and extends the whole year. Alongside the music, there will be in-depth intellectual discussions and masterclasses on every facet of jazz, where our presenters will engage in meaningful conversations with experts on art, life and politics will all use jazz as a starting point.”Previous Masterclass hosts include journalist Gwen Ansell, Composer and DJ Nicola Conte, Record Label Executive Dr Sipho Sithole, Art Educator Motsumi Makhene and broadcaster Brenda Sisane.Jazz enthusiasts are delighting at the month’s line-up, which also encourages an introduction for new fans to the music. Maloka says, “Jazz is an evolution. It is about developing the ear. We have prepared months in advance to offer a line-up that engages all ears, and all ages. In the long-term we aim to create more literature on South African jazz artists that can be used as a reference for all those interested in the art form and cultivate a growing contingent of jazz enthusiasts.”Jazzuary 2019 kicked off when several Kaya FM presenters travel to New York to experience the New York Jazz Festival and visit some of the city’s premier jazz venues, including the Blue Note Jazz Club. As part of the visit, the Kaya FM team broadcasted live content from the festival and interview artists, further enriching the experience of Jazzuary. “Jazz resounds with many followers, it stands the test of time, is evergreen and remains beautiful and exciting to listen to. You can have a classic in a brand-new song,” explains Brenda Sisane, host of Kaya FM’s Art of Sunday Show. “From the way it’s composed and arranged, you can tell it will live long.”To get involved in this month-long celebration, or to find out more information on Jazzuary visit www.Jazzuary.fm.
