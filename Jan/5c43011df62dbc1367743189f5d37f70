She is an inspiration to the nation and has achieved so much in her sporting career against all odds. We welcome her and look forward to being a part of her ‘road to greatness’, as she continues to succeed as a sportswoman,” Masilo Masha, Nike marketing manager.

Kgothatso Montjane could not contain herself: “I am so excited to be part of the Nike family and be included amongst Nike athletes. It shows that if you work hard enough, rewards will come.

With a medal at the Tokyo Paralympics in 2020 in her sight, her 2019 will certainly be a year for growth.
