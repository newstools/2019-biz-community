We fill a big geographic gap, we can now talk knowledgeably about Southern Africa, they bring great digital and social skills and they are award winners."Daan du Toit, MD of Mark1 had the following to add: "With our roots in Europe, we have always taken a keen interest in the latest industry trends and top advertising technologies. To stay ahead of the curve, we frequently attend top European events like DMEXCO, Ad:Tech London and ATS, but being connected to 30 global agencies takes this to the next level for us. While we obviously love the fact that we are independent, this naturally has its challenges and one challenge is certainly not having international counterparts to gain some deep learning from. Being part of Tribe Global immediately illuminated that challenge for us and we are gaining invaluable knowledge from other territories almost daily."  On being a first in Africa, Daan had the following to say: "We are immensely proud to be the first African agency accepted into the tribe, especially as they have very strict criteria for being accepted. I am sure having our best year in terms of winning awards has counted massively in our favour. They also limit the number of agencies allowed in every territory and it is a massive compliment to be accepted as their first member on the continent. We are extremely passionate about digital marketing in Africa and growing the local industry, so I feel we are the ideal partner for them here.TRIBE GLOBAL BIOTribe Global is a growing network of successful, independent, owner-run communications agencies.
