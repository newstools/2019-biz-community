Online content marketing and PR is growing in popularity, but companies often miss out on the best feature it offers – trackable links. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/480096-625x420.jpg" alt="The one thing which makes online PR a winning marketing tool" width="625" height="420">Many PR agencies write articles for their clients, and even get them published, but they exclude trackable links which are needed for lead generation and success measurements. Without trackable links to your website you are missing out on the main benefit of online campaigns - the ability of users to immediately visit your website and interact with your brand. Trackable links also make it possible for you to see exactly where your clients come from and which marketing channels are the most successful. The Tech Lab founder Ryan Brunyee said articles with trackable links have proved more effective than any other channel to drive traffic to their clients’ websites and generate leads. These links also boost the client website’s SEO, which result in more organic search traffic through Google. Brunyee explained that The Tech Lab has agreements with all the top IT publications in South Africa to ensure their clients’ articles get published and that their tracking links are included. “If your PR agencies cannot guarantee that your article will be published on the top publications with tracking links, it is time to get a new PR agency,” said Brunyee. Case study - Codehesion  The Tech Lab has been working with mobile app and website development specialists Codehesion on their content marketing with great success. Brunyee said their content marketing campaigns outperformed all other channels, including Google Search. “A recent Codehesion campaign with two articles published on the top IT websites resulted in 1,836 website visits,” said Brunyee. This is significantly higher than the Google Search campaign with a similar budget, which provided only 630 website visits.
