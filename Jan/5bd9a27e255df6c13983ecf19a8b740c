Where do you live, work and play?I work and play in Parktown North.2. What’s your claim to fame?

Describe your career so far. I’ve loved it, warts and all, so far! Thankfully I was ignorant enough in 1998 to think I could start my own agency, so Chillibush was born out of a suburban garage – not sure I would have the courage to do it all again.The 18 years of running the agency were fantastic – we achieved wonderful things and I was very proud of the team and the work we did.I sold it in 2014. I then spent some time with my young children, started a charity and launched Afterburn, a purpose-driven marketing consultancy. In 2017 I purchased the IMC and have very exciting plans, starting with the Nedbank IMC Conference in March 2019.   <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/469863.jpg" alt="20 top industry experts.

According to Forbes Online, “brutal honesty is a current trend that has been gaining steam, and we should all expect it to continue”. It is suggested marketers take advantage by clearly stating what their products and services are good at and where they need improvement. Objective customer reviews could back up the statements – instead of being hidden by social media managers – which translates honesty into brand integrity, then trust, then sales.
