Taking it to the next level of course – with a brand-new partnership with Brand South Africa (no pun intended).Comments Brand South Africa's General Manager: Marketing, Sithe Ntombela, “Promoting a positive image for the country takes a number of committed stakeholders who are passionate about the country and advancing its long-term image and reputation. Brand South Africa is happy to partner with Regency Global in creating and telling a reinvigorated story of South Africa, for South Africans and the world”.If you haven’t heard yet, SA INC. is about changing conversations - from the dinner table to the shebeen, from dusty street corners to gym cafeterias – about what it means to be a business and a citizen in a country waking up to a new decade of hope stimulated by political renewal. It’s about shaking off the doom and gloom and sharing the real news that doesn’t reach the headlines. News on a shifting paradigm that is profit-with-purpose; that places shared value, innovation and inclusivity on the centre stage of our national priorities. From March 2019, join South Africa to unfold a shared vision - through television and social media - and do your part to promote the cause by sharing the conversation.Brand South Africa is of course an organisation that ‘gets it’. For two decades they have been polishing the brand of South Africa (through good and bad times) to make sure that we shine in the eyes of the world. Through multiple well-crafted initiatives, Brand South Africa connects and builds relationships that nurture the status of South Africa and the globally competitive opportunities it presents. As the custodians of our national brand, an alliance with SA INC. was a natural fit to create synergies in making sure the message is received loud and clear. We are proudly South African and we are making a difference. Today.BLSA is the organisation that facilitates an exchange of ideas and effective dialogue between South Africa’s business leaders and key players within civil society, labour and government. With a focus on advancing a modern, inclusive and growing economy; BLSA has teamed up with SA INC. to demonstrate in a tangible way, how, when business succeeds, South Africa succeeds; exploring the central role that business plays in addressing poverty, unemployment, economic injustice and workplace transformation in the lives of real South Africans.SA INC. is the brainchild of Regency Global, an award-winning communications and development agency and creators of the ‘It’s Africa’s Time’ and ‘Time for Global Action’ series’, broadcast across Africa and the world through multiple distribution partners. Given the recent shift in political will, it was a no brainer to ‘bring it home’ and tell the South African story with a style and care that does justice to our diverse and unique country and the transformation and inclusive growth we have already achieved. Yes, of course there is still much to do and many challenges to overcome, but by sharing the inspiring experiences of people whose lives have significantly changed for the good, we can begin to gain a broader understanding of what is happening, what is possible and what our collective future holds.We invite all South Africans to play their part and join us in passing the message on that amazing things are happening in South Africa; that people’s lives are improving; that companies are involved in jaw-dropping innovations and that outside of the bubble of edited negativity is a story that needs to see the light of day. We are proud to be involved and challenge all stakeholders who can make a difference to do so.
