Set yourself a budgetBefore you embark on your Google Ads campaign, decide how much you can afford to spend. Monitor the daily activity and make sure that you get alerted when you reach your daily limit. Otherwise, if you let the campaign carry on unchecked, you run the risk of spending money that you had not budgeted for or - worse still - do not have. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/480016.png" alt="How to maximise your spend on Google Ads" width="594" height="395">Have a keyword strategyGoogle Ads works on keywords and user intent. What this means is that when a user types in a certain search query, Google will display ads on the front page of the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) that are related to the keywords present in the query. Says Lisa Schneider, managing director of the Digital School of Marketing (DSM): “As a digital marketer, it is your job to make sure that your ads tie into the queries that users are making which are related to your company. This means that you need to develop a keyword strategy for your advertisements that ties in with your business objectives. Studying a Digital Marketing Course online at DSM would assist you with understanding Google Ads and a keyword strategy.”Monitor the resultsHave a Google Analytics account that is constantly monitoring your website and seeing what traffic is coming through based on the activity of your Google Ads campaigns. If you can see that your campaign isn’t generating the traffic you need, tweak your ads to get better responses.To get the most out of the money that you spend on Google Ads campaigns, it would be very beneficial to complete a Digital Marketing Course. This would give you a good grounding in terms of how Google Ads works and to see how it fits into the bigger digital marketing picture.
