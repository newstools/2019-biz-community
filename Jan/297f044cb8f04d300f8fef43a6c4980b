Integrated campaigns dominated with 22 entries, including Mortimer Harvey’s "I want to make that" campaign for Absa Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB). The campaign features a little girl whose big dreams colour the way she imagines the world. It culminates in an older version of herself, still having the bravery to imagine, and the will to make her visions a reality – truly defining the meaning of Africanacity, a word specifically created to describe the uniquely African way of getting things done. Andrew Fradd, Group Managing Director of Mortimer Harvey, says the MH family is delighted with the announcement. “The Midas Awards celebrates the world’s best financial advertising and we are looking forward to a successful outcome.”
