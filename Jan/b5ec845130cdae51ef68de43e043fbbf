What is in Cape Town is the front runner.Bloubergstrand — a beach north of the city that affords views of Table Mountain — tops the list. Sabi Sands — a private game reserve located in the Kruger National Park — ranks second. While Pretoria’s “Jacaranda Trees” — not exactly a place — is placed third.Other notable mentions include: Lion’s Head (9th), Graaf Reinet’s Valley of Desolation (12th), Durban’s Natural History Museum (25th), Elands River Falls in Emgwenya, Mpumalanga (36th), and the Umhlanga Lighthouse (49th).The list, while obviously not founded in hard statistics, does at least get one thing absolutely correct: South Africa’s pretty beautiful whichever direction you look.Catch the full list here.
