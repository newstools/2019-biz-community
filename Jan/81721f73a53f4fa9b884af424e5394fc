A clear definition of the target market is the essential basis on which to build winning brand strategy This is where Brand Atlas is useful. Brand Atlas users are able to specify all the segment profiles they are interested in. For example ‘young black women with tertiary education and small children’ or ‘males over the age of 35’, or ‘people who shop at MRP for clothes for kids’ or tens of thousands of others segments they might want to define. Users are able to describe or profile each specified segment against these measures:  Demographics (including life stage)  Psychographics Vices Loyalty programmes  Mediagraphics Online and digital (websites, transactions, shopping, social media) Money (insurance, investment, banking)  Retail store usage  FMCG brand usage Automotive (marques, filling stations, fitment centres) Other miscellaneous topics Please visit our website (alltold.co.za) or contact Megan (megan@alltold.co.zabRev('brev-79012b9a-bc3b-4973-83b4-1567bcf497df', '>a/\<az.oc.dlotlla@nagem>"az.oc.dlotlla;46#&nagem:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<') or 072 060 5241) to find out more about Brand Atlas.
