Good to know is that exhibitor and speaker bookings are already streaming in and visitors are urged to block off their diaries for South Africa’s ultimate marketing, advertising, design and all that good stuff expo, which will be taking place over 5 and 6 June 2019 at Sandton Convention Centre in Johannesburg. Madex 2018 brought thousands of marketers together while providing an opportunity for advertising, marketing, design, PR and social media agencies to speak directly to their target audience from one place over the span of two momentous days. The 2019 show is going to be offering even more opportunities, with an interactive exhibition floor, inspirational seminars hosted within two theatre areas – the Fundamentals and the Marketing Academy, a colour-in wall, a New Product Display area, featuring the year’s hottest promotional goods to name a few, and the all-new Madex Appreciation Stations (stayed tuned for more details on this and more!). For more information and to register to attend, please visit www.madex.co.za. Please note that the entrance cost to Madex 2018 is R50 online, R100 at the door. Markex 2019, Africa’s by-invitation-only premier promotional product exhibition, will be co-located with Madex for the third year, and is aimed strictly at promotional products resellers, agents and distributors. This is Markex’ 32nd year in operation. Please visit www.markex.co.za for more details.
