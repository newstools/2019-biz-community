In advertising, it is often aimed or focused at the client or the project we are working on. We are always looking outward. It is very seldom that we have a clear point of view about ourselves.I remember once being told by a friend the main reason ad agencies make such bad ads about themselves is because an eye finds it very difficult to look at itself. This lack of depth and understanding is never more obvious than at the beginning of the year, when people in the industry are asked what is important for the year ahead.The answers I read were in a trade mag and what struck me was how similar the answers were. Almost everybody answered that creativity was the way forward. Initially that made me happy, but then I got this weird feeling of dread. Really? These people all passionately believe in creativity? Half these people wouldn’t know what creativity was if it kicked them in the nuts. It was like some publicist had told them that creativity was the right answer. It was like they were going through the motions in a glitter-less pantomime. They had made ‘creativity’ just a word. And what’s worse, they had made it sound boring and unimportant.This year, it felt like these people were treading water in a pool of corporate correctness. They were waiting for something. Doing only what was required. There was no danger or audaciousness. It felt like they had no confidence or point of view.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1610/364589-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source © ." width="120" height="120">In defence of the often maligned creativeWhen I got into this business 20 years ago, creatives and creative departments were always called the crazy ones. We were portrayed as necessary yet unpredictable...By Damon Stapleton 19 Oct 2016There have been many that have said advertising needs to get its confidence back. The question is always, how?Before I answer that, let’s look at the industry landscape. In the last six months, some of the greatest advertising agencies that have ever been have disappeared. Poof. Gone forever. Insert Kodak story.Now, did they disappear because of what we all say is the most important thing in advertising –creativity? No. Perhaps the work got worse in the end, but I can promise you it wasn’t because the creatives didn’t try. I know, I spoke to them.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/444655-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Screengrab from the Jordan Peterson 'difficulties of creative people' interview." width="120" height="120">Do you speak creativity?"Doing stand-up in Poland." This is a phrase that we used to say at an agency I use to work at many years ago. It referred to a bad meeting with a client that involved a creative presentation...By Damon Stapleton 13 Jun 2018These agencies disappeared because people cared about the wrong things. These agencies disappeared because they became boring. These agencies disappeared because they stopped having a point of view. And, creativity became just a word. It stopped meaning anything. When that happens, no process, delivery mechanism or structure can save you. The centre cannot hold because you have nothing of value anymore. There is nothing to sell.To answer the original question, confidence in our industry has always come from doing, not talking. That will never change. Turning creativity into a verb. Making sh!t. Astounding the world. Doing what has never been done. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1808/454083-120x120.jpg?2" alt="What do you want creativity to do?" width="120" height="120">What do you want creativity to do?"What can creativity do?"

It is a strange question...By Damon Stapleton 22 Aug 2018Doing what others won’t or can’t. Being brave and trying very hard to create a little magic. Doing will give us our confidence and, in turn, begin to change the way we see ourselves.2019 is not the year where we have the luxury of simply going through the motions. We cannot give the same boring answers. We need to remember what we are capable of. We need to fight. We have to believe in creativity again. It cannot just be a word. We have to make it mean something. There is no other way.As an industry, we need to remember that our confidence has always come from building dangerous cathedrals.“We don’t see things as they are, we see them as we are." – Anais Nin
