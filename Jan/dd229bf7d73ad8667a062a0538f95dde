Digital-first adaptive contentThis type of marketing allows people to engage with the content in some way. We’re in an era where attention is expensive and the information is cheap, and we know that content is only as powerful as the way it reaches its audience.Content needs to be adapted to how the audience consumes it, whether it is the online streaming of a video service or on channels like Instagram and Spotify - all based on audience interest. It is developed around their context, mood and goals. Ultimately, the takeout is ‘more’. More adaptive content, more interactive content, and more personalised content. 2. Three-second vertical video formatsThis is from both a brand love and a performance media perspective.

Brands that act in favour of something and view their audience as citizens, not merely consumers. Two examples of such marketing is Nike’s campaign in support of South Africa’s Olympic gold medalist Caster Semenya, and Absolut Vodka, which has been celebrating gay pride since 1981, having introduced special bottles with LGBTQI messaging, and having been a sponsor of RuPaul’s drag race for a number of years. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/458718-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Screen grabs from the ad." width="120" height="120">#OrchidsandOnions: Nike's Caster Semenya ad just does itGreat marketing is one thing, poor customer service and incompetence is another - and that's why Telkom gets both an Orchid and an Onion this week...By Brendan Seery 18 Sep 2018Corporates and brands need to know what their purpose is, and provide solutions, not advertise to them.4. Voice and digital audioThe rise of voice prompts and digital audio presents a new spectrum of audience engagement opportunities. Digital audio is quickly on the rise through streaming services and digital advertising platforms with opportunities to engage with various contextual audiences with content can be specifically tailored to 5.
