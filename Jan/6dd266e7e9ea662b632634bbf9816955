But there was only one founder behind it — Barbara Proctor, maiden name Gardner.”What’s in a name?That’s why AdAge explains she named her firm Proctor & Gardner Advertising, “to give the impression of a white male behind the curtains,” and says the resemblance to the already-famous-at-the-time ‘Procter & Gamble’ didn't hurt.But it wasn’t all smoke and mirrors. In fact, Proctor’s insistence of ethical advertising would do well in today’s age of truth-telling and purpose-led marketing.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475188.jpg" alt="#BizTrends2019: Year of the social impact brand (again)" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: Year of the social impact brand (again)Amidst two extremes -- audience apathy on one end and backlash against perceived social washing on the other -- the ad industry has emerged fresh-faced and focused: Ready to prove that we're thoughtful, attentive partners who listen when our audience speaks, able to hold a conversation that doesn't always place ourselves and our interests at the very centre of it...By Auryn Hiscock and Mikhaila Hunter 15 Jan 2019For example, Proctor was famously fired from a campaign, after refusing to work on a 1970 TV commercial that intended to sell hair products by mimicking a civil-rights demonstration, with women running down the streets waving hairspray cans, demanding to have their hair ‘foamed’. Typical advertising fodder, but not an idea Proctor wanted to be associated with.This was during the days of the black revolution in the USA, and brought to the fore Proctor’s vow “never to participate in the negative portrayal of women or blacks,” says the Washington Post.The agency was fired as a result of her refusal, but soon garnered a string of brave clients along the lines of Kraft, Ralston-Purina, Illinois Bell, Alberto-Culver and CBS-TV’s Channel 2. Reel Chicago reports that their billings grew to $12m by 1992, but the economic recession hit hard and the agency went on to file for bankruptcy protection in 1995, following two decades of trailblazing success.From double minority to ‘the only’Adding to the agency’s successes, Face2Face Africa calls Proctor a true ad industry pioneer. In the Mad Men era she referred to herself as a ‘double minority’ – black and female, starting her agency by taking out a loan “at a time when chances like these were unavailable.”Luckily, inequalities are finally being acknowledged, but we’re a long way from standing on equal footing. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477197-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Langstrup ©" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Making workplace inclusion everybody's businessMicrosoft has made inclusion every employee's responsibility in much the same manner as one eats the proverbial 'business elephant' - one bite at a time.
