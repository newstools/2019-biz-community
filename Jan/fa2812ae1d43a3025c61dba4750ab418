The campaign has been met with mixed reactions on social media, with the majority labelling the publicity stunt as “distasteful”. This then prompts a question around shock ads, or as marketers say, “shockvertising”. How far is too far? Are shock ads effective in changing consumer behaviour or, is shocking people simply off-putting?      I partnered with @Volkswagen and @DriveDry to make a change in 2019. We don’t want to see another year where thousands of lives are lost on our roads because of drinking & driving.Take the pledge and make the change to #VWDriveDry in 2019. #Nomuzihttps://t.co/HsxMlIBjQr— #MoozlieVictory�� (@NoMoozlie) January 11, 2019Some have shared their outrage. Some have shared their support. But who will share their pledge? 300 000 people saw these posts but only 4 people commented on reckless driving.

Many lives have been lost through texting and driving. #DriveDry Read the article to get the depth of this campaign #VWDriveDry https://t.co/iUCWpM2qtR— Pat Mahlangu (@iam_thokozani1) January 11, 2019In the digital era, we are constantly flooded with marketing messages, as brands fight over a piece of the pie. However, the campaigns that often do catch our eye are the ones that provoke controversy and deliberately violate our expectations. So, in a bid to raise eyebrows, brands use shock tactics to turn heads or call out irresponsible behaviour. However people have become increasingly desensitised to ads that try to vilify them for their behaviour, there are limitations when it comes to implementing the shock factor. Rather than road safety ads showing a gruesome car crash, or anti-smoking campaigns plastered with grotesque images of lung cancer, marketers have adopted a different approach, highlighting the emotional consequences of bad habits on ourselves and our loved ones. This is what #VWDriveDry aimed to achieve with its campaign. The question is, did it work?People just don't want to face the truth that texting or using your phone while driving is dangerous not only for them but also for other innocent people in the road who comply with rules of the road. People will always shun the truth!

Take for example Nike’s 2018 #FairnessFirst campaign with Colin Kaepernick, Serena Williams, and Caster Semenya. These athletes all faced discrimination in their careers. Nike took some of sport’s most celebrated and contested players to showcase the power of the underdog. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/458308-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: How Nike inspires others to 'just do it' with commodity activism" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: How Nike inspires others to 'just do it' with commodity activismWhat do Colin Kaepernick, Serena Williams and Caster Semenya have in common?

Talkability is certainly one of the most important elements of campaigns our agency, BrandTruth Integrated Content Practice, practice every day.One thing is for sure, Volkswagen and its Drive Dry campaign could not have predicted that the narrative would shift from awareness around driving drunk, to a character and career assassination of Nomuzi Mabena. But this is a high-risk factor that comes with using shock tactics. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/478826-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#VWDriveDry: Take home lessons" width="120" height="120">#VWDriveDry: Take home lessonsOn Thursday, 10 January 2019, Twitter went into a frenzy over what appeared to be Nomuzi "Moozlie" Mabena in a car crash captured on InstaLive...By Sheila Afari 22 Jan 2019With the devastating road fatalities in South Africa – many caused by drunk drivers – one cannot deny the importance of such a campaign. However, the outcome became more about the tactics rather than the actual call to action: to stop irresponsible driving.  So why did Nomuzi Mabena and #VWDriveDry garner such public criticism? Firstly, consumers should never feel misled, regardless of how strong and necessary the messaging is. Taking 14 hours to notify the public that the video was, in fact, an awareness campaign, was perhaps too long. Its intentions should have been made clear. Although the use of “shockvertising” in this campaign did achieve traditional PR goals of AVE and social media hits, did it encourage people to reconsider their driving habits? <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477798-120x120.jpg" alt="Screengrab from ." width="120" height="120">Deception is the lowest form of marketingPeople first engage with people and brands for many reasons related to the first-impression they create - but they stay engaged when there is recognition of, and comfort in the VALUES of those people and brands...By Nick Grubb 16 Jan 2019Only time will tell when annual road accident statistics are released. But the fact remains, brands cannot afford to underestimate the intelligence of its audience. This is where “commodity activism” comes in. Notable brands such as Nike, Gillette, Nando’s and Castle Lager, are popularly known for social commentary in their campaigns. The simple difference between these brands and the #VWDriveDry campaign is that the latter’s intentions were not clear. “Shockvertising” does indeed bring the issues that people don’t want to talk about directly into the public domain. However, how brands relay the message is important now more than ever, particularly when consumer behaviour merges with social responsibility. Individual consumers purchase brands that share similar interests and values. Not all activism can be commodified.
