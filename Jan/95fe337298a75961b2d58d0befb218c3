CNN elaborates:Girls are pulled out of school first when the money isn't available to pay fees, and women clock up hours of unpaid work looking after sick relatives when healthcare systems fail… If all the unpaid care work carried out by women across the globe was done by a single company, it would have an annual turnover of $10tn.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/463043-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: How sending girls to school changes the economy" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: How sending girls to school changes the economyEver thought the answer to breaking the country's poverty cycle was as simple as improving basic education for females?

That's how far into 2018 a woman had to work to earn what a man earned in 2017. Here's how to stand up for your rights to equal pay for equal work...By Leigh Andrews 16 Apr 2018That day’s only expected to arrive in the year 2059 – if you’re a white woman, working in the USA. If not, it’ll take even longer…But gender aside, there’s further rich-poor discrepancy across the globe.Cashless society, here we come…Taken at a monetary level only, there’s still deeper inequality, because in addition to spendable cash, what the rich have that the poor do not is credit. Physical cash is becoming more of a hindrance, as it’s a safety risk as well as being bulky and yes, dirty, which is why we’ve seen a rise in contactless and cashless options of late.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1708/406051-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cash is no longer king.

It’s the millennial way to rely on smartphone payment apps rather than hauling a wallet around through your day.So sure, that means your purchase is now just an easy swipe of the ole credit card, but what about those who don’t have bank cards?There’s the argument that the unbanked aren’t making this type of purchase anyway, but even churches are reporting a doubling of donations after trialling contactless ‘donation box’ technology.Marc-Alexander Christ, co-founder of SumUp, adds on the Retail Systems website:In 2019 we are going to see an even greater uptake in contactless payments as we transition towards a truly cashless society – this means that elements of everyday life will need to adapt, and the digital collection plate is an amazing example of tradition meeting technology.Cashless society may well be the future, especially in Africa, but we do need to be aware of the risk of increasing inequality in excluding large portions of the population when adapting new technology.
