Consumers were given a chance to colour in the car the way they want, with that, stand a chance to win the ultimate prize, a Hyundai Kona! The #KONAxAFROPUNK event saw consumers come in numbers to colourful experience which hosted a number of famous faces in the music space, including Mafikizolo, Manthe Rabane and Lerato Kganyago who came to enjoy the silent disco performance by DJ Muzi among other activities. “With the Hyundai Kona, we want to attract the larger-than-life group of audience, who believe in expressing themselves, who don’t deliberately do what is deemed 'odd' but, are just merely being themselves. And we thought that a collaboration with AfroPunk speaks to the consumers for whom the Kona was created for,” says Oscar Makola, Hyundai South Africa’s Marketing Director. Filled with colour and amazing features, the Hyundai Kona is a subcompact five-door crossover SUV, that will definitely turn heads this summer. Available in two-tone colour options, you can be sure to take on the urban jungle. The Kona studio will stage an intimate, money-can’t-buy experience at AfroPunk’s main event at Constitution Hill on 30 and 31 December.
