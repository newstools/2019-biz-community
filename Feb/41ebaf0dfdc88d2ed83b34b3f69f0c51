In a heavy-duty industry like ours, brand and product communications are generally purely functional with minimal aesthetic appeal. It was refreshing to see how Decimal infused slick, modern aesthetics and conceptual depth to our brand. We are excited to break new ground and drive our business forward with them,” says Francois Marais, Director of Sales and Marketing at Pilot Crushtec. Decimal’s proficient team are now tasked with managing all the through-the-line communications for Pilot Crushtec, including their creative strategy, brand development, brand awareness campaigns, OOH and website development. The highly anticipated, revamped Pilot Crushtec website is due to be launched within the next month, and an innovative brand campaign for their Metso machines is underway, so keep an eye out for these exciting new brand developments. “Pilot Crushtec is South Africa’s leading supplier of quarrying and mining equipment, so we are extremely excited to be partnering with such a formidable industry leader, and more so to play a part in amplifying their business growth through impactful brand communication. Watch this space!” says Decimal Agency’s Managing Director, Raffaele McCreadie.
