We were pleasantly surprised by how easily the Heart FM management and on-air talent amplified the Sun Met and the theme. As a result, the value that the event gained on air was more than ever before in the three-year history of the Sun International sponsorship of the Sun Met.” Heart FM is moving rapidly towards becoming a lifestyle brand as the biggest commercial radio station in Cape Town. The station’s Managing Director, Renee Redelinghuys, comments, “It made perfect sense to partner with the Sun Met. The event is about entertaining and creating memories which is what we aim to do on air and in our communities on a daily basis.” Radio remains a resilient and critical part of the marketing mix, and this year’s Sun Met strategy was no exception. Denver Apollus, Head of Radio Innovation at Heart FM, says, “We believe strongly in bringing together the programming and marketing departments in a way that creates exhilarating content for our listeners, whilst delivering on key objectives for clients.” It’s the strength of great partnerships that allow us as a station to consistently redefine broadcast activations and the audience experience. Whilst other media platforms struggle with dwindling audiences and revenues, we are experiencing the contrary, through offering a partnership that sees the use of all our platforms reach the right people, at the right time.” Flusk concludes, “Heart FM synchronised their on-air talent to amplify the event; talent was well briefed, and they did some great interviews with Sun International representatives, but also managed to bring other sponsors into the conversation, which really made the campaign of 'African Luxury: Precious Metals' work really well. On event day, the presenters were superb at hosting the red carpet, as well as for the fashion shows and Best Dressed. Hundreds of Sun Met patrons gathered to see these events – something we’ve never seen before. To end the day the DJs for the After-Party really gave the crowd value for their money. Thanks to Heart FM, the Sun Met is back on the social calendar as one of the biggest social events in Cape Town and South Africa.” Sun International is already in talks with the station about the partnership for 2020.
