The benefit of studying online and part-time, particularly with a world-class institution, means you’re able to stay up-to-date with the most current tools related to your industry, without having to interpret your life as a busy working professional. Since 2013, the University of Cape Town (UCT), together with GetSmarter, a brand of 2U Inc., has provided career growers and starters with access to its innovative portfolio of online short courses. Today, you have the opportunity to improve and increase your skillset by studying one of over 60 online short courses. UCT is the only institution from Africa to make the top 200 list of the Times Higher Education World University Rankings. And this year, the institution moved from its previous position of 171st to 156th in the world.1 UCT is also the only African member of the Global University Leaders Forum (GULF), within the World Economic Forum. GULF is made up of just 27 of the world’s top universities.2With more than 80 specialist research units, and six faculties, UCT describes itself as being dedicated to producing graduates who will influence on both a national and universal level. Just a few of the alumni UCT boasts, are Professor Christiaan Barnard, along with three Nobel Laureates: Sir Aaron Klug, Professor Alan MacLeod Cormack and Professor Emeritus J.M. Coetzee.3Online education providers and digital education company, GetSmarter, a brand of 2U, Inc., have ensured anyone, regardless of age, destination, or qualifications, has access to UCT’s world-class faculty, and a number of industry experts. Through their collaboration, UCT and GetSmarter provide a digital learning experience to enhance the very best elements of the face-to-face learning experience. Students can study subjects like digital marketing, accounting, advanced project management, or user experience design in a matter of weeks, and earn a certificate from UCT on successful completion of their course.  This year, GetSmarter, together with UCT, will be introducing new online short courses covering topics in: disruptive innovation such as Fintech and Energy Efficiency and Sustainability, as well as courses on developing traditional industries such as Agile Project Management and Construction Management. These part-time courses provide working professionals the opportunity to realise, and embrace, the fact that change is coming to every industry, and it’s better to run towards rather than away from it. While online learning is for all, studies have shown millennials learn particularly well in an online and digital environment. According to a study completed by Mayo Clinic, millennials thrive in environments where there is great emphasis on feedback, collaboration, technology, and tutoring or mentorship.4 When studying online with GetSmarter, students have access to a 24/7 technical and support team, a personal Student Success Manager, as well as a Head Tutor who is considered to be an expert in the subject matter of the course. Past students have provided positive testimonials of their experience of learning online with GetSmarter. One such student, Visha Govender, said, “I best enjoyed being able to learn at my own pace. The interactivity of the discussion forums, and reading other students’ thoughts and experiences, really helped my learning.”5At the same time, students with more than 15 years experience and who are well into their careers have had similar learning experiences. Dean Genade, a Business Consultant in Strategic Business Development for a large Financial Services company said, “I wanted to improve my learning with respect to dealing with complex projects or programmes. I found the ‘advanced’ focus of the course appealing and relevant to my job. I am impressed with the standard of the lecture content and I have no doubt that the course will help towards my future growth in my current role.” One of the greatest benefits of studying UCT online short courses with GetSmarter is that students can learn in their own time, at their own pace, and at a fraction of the cost, in comparison to graduate courses at tertiary institutions.
