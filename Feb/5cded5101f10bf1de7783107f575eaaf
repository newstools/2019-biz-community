The Root sets the scene:USC’s Annenberg Inclusion Initiative did some research and found some not-so-surprising results: Between 2007 to 2017, out of the nearly 50,000 characters in the 1,100 most popular films who had speaking roles, just over 70 percent of those characters were white. Conversely, only about 12% were black, while less than 7% were Asian or Latinx.
