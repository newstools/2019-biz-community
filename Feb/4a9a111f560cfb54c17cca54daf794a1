We're just normal people with normal lives at the end of the day and a lot of us have PVRs in our homes. We're either on our phones when an ad comes up, or worse, we leave the room when there's a commercial.Imagine if everyone behaved the same way. Who are we actually marketing to? Who are we communicating to?From the inside outSometimes we just need to look at things from inside out to understand our consumers better. Here we are in the advertising and marketing industry but we're the very same people that are quick to press fast forward when an ad comes on TV.Fomo is a real thing – we're constantly wondering what we're missing when we're not on our phones.

Everywhere. All the time. Not too much to ask is it? My advice is to be present as continually as possible.
