While slightly better than quarter 3’s 4% and quarter 1’s 4.4% - the worst quarterly decline on the prior year for 2018 - it was still more than the best quarter on the prior year, Q2 which had a 2.5% decline. Daily NewspapersThe decline in the previous quarter continued for Daily Newspapers, but Q4’s 1.9% was the second-best quarter for the year. Apart a nearly half a percentage increase in Q1, Q2 and Q3 of 2018 declined by over 4% and over 2% respectively. The quarter saw a 7.6% decline on the prior year. While still a big decline, it is almost half the decline of Q1, Q2 and Q3, all of which had double-digit declines. The Star, which showed an increase in Q3 over the previous quarter and year, declined in Q4 by 0.8%, but continued its upward movement over the prior year, with a 1.7% increase.
