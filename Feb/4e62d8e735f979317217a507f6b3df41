Describe your career so far. My career has been very consistent. It’s been a really good 10 years.I’m currently a presenter on Expresso; radio presenter on my own show, ‘Lunch with Leigh-Anne’; model; actress; and motivational speaker. 4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. I love spending time with my family and friends. It’s good to catch up with people that you love, it’s like they centre you and feed your soul in a good way. However, at the same time I love some quiet moments, just relax and re-energise. 5. What do you love about your industry? The people I get to meet. Travelling and meeting actors, musicians, and writers. Every day, my job inspires me in a different way.

Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. My day starts very early. I wake up at 3:30am and arrive at the studio for hair and makeup at 4:30am. Expresso starts at 6am and ends at 9am. During this time, I’m on set doing my best to cheer up our viewers’ mornings. As soon as the show is wrapped up, I head to my gym session at 10am. At this point my mind is craving a workout – well, sometimes. My radio show starts from noon to 3pm, so that’s where I am for the afternoon. I use my evenings for meetings, voice-overs, MC gigs and events.
