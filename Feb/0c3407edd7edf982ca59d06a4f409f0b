Julian Jordaan, Commercial Director at 365 Digital, explains, "Events where both sides get together (outside of awards ceremonies) is a much needed element in today's fragmented online ad world. If adding value to brands and consumers is the goal, then we owe it to them to engage often, debate topics, ask the hard questions and collaborate more. Just do better work!"The first in the workshop series is taking place on the 19th February and will see some of South Africa's top publishers come together at Google's Johannesburg office in Ballyclare Dr., Bryanston. Topics being addressed among others include:  Adserver Infrastructure & Architecture and How to Build For The Future  A Holistic View on Monetisation  Data and Audience Building, Segmentation and Monetisation  Ad Blockers and The Affects on Consumers and Publishers 365 Digital is also hosting similar events in Lagos, Nigeria, in March 2019, as well as in Nairobi, Kenya, later in the year.
