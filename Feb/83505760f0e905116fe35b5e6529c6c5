That, coupled with the music video tone and pace, I believe gives BMW a unique injection of youth and innovation. It’s that juxtaposition of old school camera techniques meshed with the modern music video pace edit that gives it something stand-out, especially in a traditional advertising market like China,” explained Lewis. Both the scale of the job, and the language barrier, were additional challenges for Lewis but he quickly realised the language of film was a common one. “It was such an incredible experience collaborating with the creatives and crew in China, a country I had never been to. Stephane, too, was a rock, and our creative collaboration was easy and flowed from the beginning. Admittedly, many on the team – creatives and clients – were taken out of their comfort zone but it’s that bravery and the team’s ability to rise to the challenge that makes ‘BMW Jackson Wang Beemer Ride’ a truly special piece,” he said.
