<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/481284-625x409.jpg" alt="HDI welcomes Junior Board of Directors 2019" width="625" height="409">JBoD is comprised of three age groups: kids (8-13 years old), teens (14–18 years old), and young adults (19-24 years old). These groups of young people each offer deep insights into brands, branding and product, and their relevance in-market through various interactions with HDI (e.g. focus groups, interviews, surveys, video diaries, idea/concept generation and testing, etc.). For the first time ever, in 2019, HDI has increased the number of board members per group, from 12 to 20. This decision was made to ensure that HDI continues to deliver the most current and diverse views to the market. “I’m always amazed at just how intelligent these young people are. I’m reminded of an interaction I had with a group of JBoDers recently. A conversation about iPhone vs Samsung quickly became a debate about iOS vs Android – and this conversation was with the kids group,” says HDI CEO, Bongani Chinkanda. JBoDs offer a keen understanding of buying patterns and perceptions for specific products along with consumption motivations. These insights come from young people who are leaders in their peer groups and are therefore predictive rather than reactive. Their positions in their social networks deliver to HDI Youth Consultancy the latest trends in the youth space, and help get our clients’ brands right on the mark.
