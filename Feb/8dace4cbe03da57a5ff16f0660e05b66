She adds that while this request was in conjunction with optimising campaign objectives, the innovation goes beyond this. You will be able to run plans, not only optimise on campaign goals but also based on budget to yield the best bang for your buck.User adversity panelsTo ensure the tool is customised for local users' needs and process, Wilkins explains that they engaged with a host of user adversity panels. “This gave us the ability to understand what users want from such a high-end tech tool. This feedback was aggregated from users who spent hours and hours with the software, in addition to learning from our many training stations.” The result is numerous changes, modifications and enhancements to improve ease and speed leading to a reduction of planning time and a more user-friendly system. Continuous enhancements to Quantum include the addition of new individual demographics variables (mode of transport and home language) that allow for multi mention responses, SEL segmentation added to the demographics and the order of the demographics selection corrected and grouped for ease of selection. All demographic and trip data have been fused and the 2015/16/17 combined data has been modelled to provide the updated Road results. The fusion process combines all demographics and trip data from the face-to-face survey for the three years’ data. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1803/431610-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Road research shows OOH now centre stage in media mix landscape" width="120" height="120">Road research shows OOH now centre stage in media mix landscapeThe new data launched by the OMC has revealed that OOH has evolved and taken centre stage in the media mix landscape...1 Mar 2018Fusion process“Several factors are taken into account in the fusion process that directly affects the audiences when fusing the three datasets,” explains Lauren Shapiro, managing partner at Kuper Research.She emphasised that the most important change is the increase in the rolled sample size. “This has allowed for more robust data and a more diverse number of routes travelled to be used when modelling the data." The process of collecting trip data and modelling routes for each update will create changes as the samples and data become more and more robust. “We are now able to assign more diverse and broader probable routing calculations into the traffic and route modelling process,” she adds. This is important as in OOH, just driving or walking by an advertisement does not constitute an impression. Utilising visibility zones, a list of factors that determine the probability that someone will actually see an advertisement. These include factors such as the size of a piece of inventory and its angle to traffic. Trish Guilford, general manager of the OMC, concluded that marketers require substantiation for investment in the type, quantity and location of media placement. “Our Road research allows the industry to evaluate and better plan OOH and is a currency that allows for OOH to offer the same metrics as all other media types.”
