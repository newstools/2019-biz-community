But the future’s exciting and we want to celebrate 25 years with a future-focussed approach. We’ve had an amazing quarter century. But what’s next?”Our team are the industry’s future leaders, so who better else to ask about the next 25 years? “We invited our employees to make predictions about the future of the industry,” adds MacKenzie. “Our people are our most important asset and we’re invested in them, so we were interested in their opinion.”Products compete against each other via algorithms to gain traction into the market, and AI w reduces the amount of clutter in the market. But stories haven’t lost their allure and when choices are made by individuals for products of desire it's the story that makes or breaks brands. - Anthony HeimCreativeIn 2044 computers are consumers, in the form of robots, home concierge systems and brain-implanted chips. The latter helps consumers concentrate on more creative pursuits instead of deciding which washing powder to purchase. And, most of the decision-making is influenced by the information technology systems that surround us.- Hilton MashongaCreative director2044 is a paperless world, print companies have reinvented themselves. And the working environment has changed, freelancers are the workforce, a team who o quickly adapt to change, and bulk up talent on demand.- Simon BrowneClient servicesPeople are smart but computers are smarter and the world is systematic with computer generated versions of us doing everything. Our every move is influenced by an algorithm, our best friend, and our daily tasks are automated. - Meagan ViljoenCreativeThere’s no digital agencies or advertising agencies, the skills and services required will have evolved to such an extent that a new type of business has emerged. It’s a business that’s an amalgamation and extension of things that we were only at the tipping point of in 2019. We don’t learn from the ‘greats of our industry’ for the way forward, we turn to the Gen Z’s and Gen Alphas. The pace at which the world is changing is too rapid to keep looking too far back… instead innovative thinking, agility and most importantly, a growth mindset keeps us relevant.- Lara-Anne DerbyshireStrategyAs we have seen in the previous 25 years and the changes that technology has had on consumers, the economy and how we interact and engage with one another. “We’re planning our future right now, we’re always planning for tomorrow,” MacKenzie added. “The entire approach, structure and transformation strategy is all about ensuring our survival. And, the best way to predict the future is to create it ourselves.”25 years of possibilityBoomtown was founded in 1994 in the rural Eastern Cape through the sale of two cows to purchase its first computer.
