An example of this is raid rooms – spaces that have popped up all over the world whereby people pay to destroy and smash things they hate. Top of the request list, globally by a long stretch is the traditional printer. “The paper always tears, the pile always jams, you lacerate your fingers when you try and retrieve it, the software is unreliable, virtually impossible to dispose of responsibly and I’m not sure that they’re recyclable – the whole thing’s a nightmare, so all in all a devasting example of bad design.”But, she says, it is possible for design projects that fulfil their functions efficiently, unlike printers, to still be badly designed, and these are what she calls pointless design projects. Her example of this is one of the most expensive, heavily promoted R&D projects of recent years… Google Glass. “The designers and engineers at Google were so enthralled by what they thought was a dazzling new technology, that they assumed the rest of us would be too. But we weren’t because we’re not idiots. Who wants to wear a dodgy pair of specs like that?”This technology didn’t really do anything that the average smartphone wasn’t already doing and it would open its adopters up to lawsuits for invasion of privacy for filming people without their permission. Unsurprisingly, said Rawsthorn, Google Glass was blindly ridiculed so much so that a special name was coined to describe the few people who actually wore it. “It’s rather a rude name… suffice to say that the first word was glass and the second word was hole.” So, Google stopped production of the product and has since tried several times to reinvent it, but never very convincingly, she said.Due to a cut in transmission in the simulcast from Cape Town, that’s where my coverage of this talk ends, sadly, but hopefully, you get the idea...
