The ability to shoot and edit video content easily, using mobile devices and cost-effective software has enabled everyone from Blue Chip organisations to start-up entrepreneurs to produce this type of content format. Video content levels the proverbial playing field. The challenge, however, lies in the fact that marketing giants still have immense resources available to them, and that smaller competitors must think like market leaders, despite limited resources.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1804/437426-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The Soapbox Films team with Stein back-left." width="120" height="120">VR and digital video storytelling as top marketing tools for 2018Creative director and virtual reality expert Brendan Stein of Soapbox Films video production company explains how to make B2B video pop and why you need to get to the 'why' fast in your VR and video marketing, or else...By Leigh Andrews 19 Apr 2018Insourcing marketing functions and consumer trustFor too long, there has been this idea that making video content requires creative agencies and large film crews, of course, supported by wealthy budgets. This is just no longer the case. Anyone can make and post a video. Kids are doing it. Where the balancing act comes, is in between producing a “home video” or a piece of content that succulently translates a brands message onto the screen. More often than not, this is in the planning, and then finishing, of the video.Direct collaboration between brand owner and production house, not only decreases costs thanks to the elimination of the middle man, but also increases the speed of production, and enables more professional content to be produced more often. There is a rising global trend whereby more and more brands are eschewing the traditional agency model, opting instead to insource creative roles and outsource directly to those responsible for execution.In conjunction with the move to insourcing marketing functions, more and more, brand reputation is linked to consumer trust. Consumers want to know more about the brands they purchase. They want to see the inner workings, the vulnerabilities and the day to day life within the brand. This, in turn, has bred a need for more authenticity. No longer are slick, high budget marketing videos the ones that necessarily gain more traction, however, authenticity should not be confused with a lack of professionalism. While live streaming and DIY brand videos serve their purpose, there is still no replacing a polished end-product. The fact is that creating authentic video content still requires a measure of professional support. While gorilla style filming certainly brings a realism to content, aspects like sound design, graphics and clever edit, will continue to elevate any video in the eyes of the audience.Explainer and how-to videosStorytelling has, through the aeons, been the best way of translating a message to an audience. Video is no doubt the best vehicle for storytelling, but thanks to the rise of the easily accessible information on every topic under the sun, brands are also benefitting from the so-called How-to, Explainer and Educational videos. Consumers are no longer only captivated by a great story, they are also wanting useful video content that, for example, shows how a product works or shares useful tools and tips on the subject matter at hand.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1607/353435.jpg" alt="Using video in marketing, HR" width="120" height="120">Using video in marketing, HRVideo has evolved in such a way that business leaders can rely on its power for both external and internal purposes; using it in customer service marketing and for internal training, mentoring and educational purposes...27 Jul 2016Explainer and how-to videos are a great way of showing that a brand cares about the consumer experience. It allows them to educate consumers and become an authoritative voice on their respective product or service. There is little more interesting than watching an explainer video narrated by a CEO, it lends a sense of authority to the product, and often teaches one how to use a product in the way it was in fact intended. Adding animation or editing real life footage together is well within this realm and creates useful content for audiences and brands alike. Video marketing is a tool that no marketer can ignore and pointing to limited resources is no longer a viable argument against the regular producing of such content. For brands wanting to rise above the noise, well-crafted and professionally finished authentic narratives will outperform other types of content in all metrics that matter – from ROI to shares, likes and conversions. As a trend to watch in 2019 – authentic, professional brand video is certainly at the top of the list.
