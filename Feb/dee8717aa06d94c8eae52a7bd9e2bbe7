Last year around October/November the Roderick Jacobs from the Rotary Club of Bloemfontein-Raadzaal contacted OFM News Manager Cathy Dlodlo about the plight of Katamelo Intermediate School in Botshabelo. The school had a library, but needed books. The Rotary Club then challenged OFM to see who can get the most books. OFM then started the campaign #ForTheLoveOFBooks on social media platforms. OFM, Bloemfontein Courant, shoppers at PicknPay Showgrounds, social media followers pitch in - but nothing could top the University of the Free State. So, when Free State Education MEC Tate Makgoe heard about the campaign, he decided to join in too, other stake holders such as Albany Bakeries, Transnet and Immanuel Fellowship Centre joined hands and made this an auspicious occasion to inculcate the culture of reading among primary school learners. Says Cathy Dlodlo OFM News Manager: “I have to tell you that this is the second school where we starting a different kind of project where OFM News is involved... What we did is that we provided the organisers with access to our news and social media platforms so that members of the Bloemfontein community would be able to find out about it and contribute to it. The MEC had the bright idea and we simply made it happen. We are proud to have been a part of something as great as this and hope that you will remember this initiative for years to come and you grow a love for reading and books.”Says Dr Makgoe: “I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone that was a part of this project. I’d like to thank all the stakeholders, from OFM, Transnet, Rotary Club and Albany Bakeries. I hope that we’ll take care of these libraries and consider them as an investment for future generations to come as we produce more leaders form this school.”The school learners received a truck of bread form Albany Bakeries, a box full of fiction and non-fictional books from OFM and other stakeholders, as well as a small treat putting a smile on their face.
