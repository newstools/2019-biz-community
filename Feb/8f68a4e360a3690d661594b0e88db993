In a nutshell, architecture is the piece of the puzzle where I factor my work into strategic branding, communication and digital technology in creating successful design solutions..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What unique skills do you bring to the field?Design creativity in architectural solutions, artistic expression in the three-dimensional realm, coordination of construction industry disciplines to bring a project to full fruition. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What excites you most about HKLM and where it’s going?The dynamism, being surrounded by a plethora of multifaceted creatives who are pushing, pulling and stretching in innovative ideas is great energy to be in..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What did it take to get to where you are today?In my exposure to a comprehensive and multitude of diverse architectural and artwork projects, clients and experiences I’ve always searched to find opportunities to merge architecture and artistic expression, as I firmly believe that the visual and spatial experience is what holds most potential to positively impact us to improve our everyday experiences in the spaces we inhabit.As 2019 began I knew that I wanted to be in a creative space to be able to nurture and maximise that in my career going forward and be challenged to expand on the creative realm that I've known up to now..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you love most about your career?Conceptualising and producing beautiful and long-lasting practical solutions for clients; creating spaces for them to enjoy and find delight in with sensory bouquets of colour, texture and sound; for the public to participate in and delight in these spaces.I enjoy creating good relationships with product suppliers, testing how far one can push the design envelope against engineering constraints, site constraints, economic constraints, including material constraints and then finally realise a plausible solution.When a project is finally complete, nothing brings me more joy than to see the spaces being used and enjoyed as intended..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s at the top of your to-do list (at work)?Make a beautiful impact with what I create..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you currently reading/watching/listening to for work?Wily’s Top 10 Marketing Trends for Engaging Consumers in the Digital Age for some content I’m looking to infuse in the concept design for a project I’m working on.

We used to say it to each other within the Engineering Faculty at Mie University in-between assignments and project deadlines.setTimeout(function(){ checkBizIcons() }, 3000);
