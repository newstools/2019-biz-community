One of its most popular features is WhatsApp location sharing; used to send your current location or the location of a specific place to another user. WhatsApp users are able to share the details and pin placement of a real-world location by looking through ‘nearby places’ or simply searching for where they'd like to go, making it easy for their friends to navigate to the chosen location.With over 1.5 billion daily active users and an exchange of 65 billion messages per day, it's critical that your brand's real-world footprint be listed accurately on this high-profile end-point, as people are increasingly using these to decide on social or business meeting locations. Most of the biggest mapping platforms and end-points are powered by other data sources and understanding where to submit your data can be a confusing exercise. WhatsApp is powered by both Facebook and Foursquare, depending on the device being used. Foursquare only accepts data in high volumes via API and that is just one example of how your data can reaches multiple channels from one source. Having a central place to disseminate your data, a starting point on its journey to multiple end-points, is key to any brand with an offline footprint. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/484198.jpg" alt="Say WhatsApp to sharing your brand locations accurately" width="596" height="339">P.S.
