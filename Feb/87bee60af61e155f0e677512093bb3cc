<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/483928.jpg" alt="Massiv Metro expands its digital footprint" width="250" height="219">The digital hub, headed by journalist Azizzar Mosupi, produces celebrity video content; topical video content based on what is current in society and also showcases Massiv Metro talent and shows. “In light of the growing Fourth Industrial Revolution and with the prevalence of new digital platforms every day, Massiv Metro aspired to have a digital platform that stands a cut above the rest and that’s when Massiv Metro TV came about,” says Mosupi. “Our team conceptualises content on a daily and weekly basis based on what is relevant in society and mainstream news; what is buzzing within Massiv Metro and what our radio listeners have identified as some of their favourite features and curated it into a visual offering for them,” she adds. While keeping true to the authentic, people-driven feel of the station, Massiv Metro TV also brings digital consumers and taxi commuters event coverage and off-air conversations with their favourite faces. “We wanted to go above and beyond what listeners are hearing on radio and give them additional content from some of their favourite celebrities and Massiv Metro DJs." Of the content mix, Mosupi says, “We have off-air conversations with our radio guests on 'Massiv Off Air' and we also make it a point to get out there and engage with taxi drivers and ordinary people on the streets and hear their thoughts on the current issues and more.” Massiv Metro TV content is available on Massiv Metro’s YouTube page; Massiv Metro website and also on screens in Gauteng taxi ranks where Massiv Metro free Wi-Fi is available. These ranks include Tembisa, Diepsloot, Vosloorus, Faraday, Tuxedo Junction, Benoni Taxi Rank, Katlehong and Orange Farm. Commuters can also look forward to the content inside their Massiv Metro taxis as they commute.
