We would like to give our people what they want. That’s why we’ve decided to include our very loyal listeners by allowing them to choose the music that we play on the station. We want everyone to come to the party,” said Zane Derbyshire. The 28-day ECR Music Makeover was launched on the 4th of February 2019 where listeners will be given the chance to dictate the playlist via ecr.co.za or at one of the ECR Music Maker Chill Zones. The ECR Music Maker Chill Zone will pop up at various parts of KZN where listeners will get a chance to vote for their favourite songs at a live voting station. They will also get an opportunity to experience KZN’s No1 Hit Music Station by interacting with popular presenters. The activation feature’s surprise performances and prize giveaways during the month of February. “This is only the beginning for us and we are excited to hear from our listeners. We want to paint KZN yellow by travelling across the province on the ground to ensure that we get everyone voting in our 28-day Music Makeover. For East Coast Radio this is an exciting new campaign and we are eager to see where this takes us,” said East Coast Radio’s station General Manager, Boni Mchunu.
