Soft drink manufacturers are strategically using mass media, billboards, sport stadia and public events to promote their products. In South Africa, Twizza has partnered with Primedia Outdoor to brand a large fleet of taxis and raise  awareness for its "Summer Fo Sho" competition. The campaign commenced in November 2018 and focused on the key commuter routes in four of South Africa’s provinces – the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Free State and North West. Furthermore, with their recent ‘Share-a-Coke’ campaign, Coca-Cola has once again proven that it is one of the most innovative brands around. The campaign features a number of unique South African names on the actual Coke cans and encourages South Africans to learn how to pronounce each other’s names correctly. The South African carbonated soft drinks market experienced value growth of 4.2% and volume growth of 4.7% between 2017 and 2018 - and is expected to continue to show positive growth over the next five years. Although the implementation of the 2018 Sugar Tax will more than likely have some influence on the industry, manufacturers have used various strategies to reduce the number of calories in their products and, thereby, ensure they remain relevant. Some of these strategies will include the reformulation of existing products, revising pack sizes, and introducing low-calorie products. Low-calorie alternatives will probably be one of the most important strategies to ensure that soft drink manufacturers in South Africa remain relevant. Although low-calorie carbonates currently comprise only 12.2% of the South African cola carbonates market, this segment is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.7% between 2019 and 2023. Most manufacturers have introduced some form of a low-calorie alternative to the market. Coca-Cola, for example, offers Coke Zero, Coke Light, as well Coke Life, which is a beverage with 37% less sugar that contains stevia leaf extract. Refreshhh also offers five sugar-free alternatives in a number of flavours, such as apple, ginger beer, cola, orange, and lemon. Although the South Africa carbonated soft drinks industry will continue to face numerous challenges in the future, consumers’ infatuation with fizzy drinks will more than likely continue to drive sales. It will, however, be key for manufacturers to understand changes within the industry, as well as the dynamic needs of consumers, to develop innovative South African products.
