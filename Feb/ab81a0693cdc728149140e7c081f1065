Aimed at acknowledging and recognising excellence in exhibition organisation, the AAXO ROAR Awards were amongst the many awards presented during the evening. Entries were judged on exhibition organisers’ successful exhibition strategy incorporating marketing, public relations, operations and activation. There was much celebration when Specialised Exhibitions Montgomery was announced the winner of three AAXO ROAR Awards: ‘Best Trade Exhibition 6,000m² and under’, for Madex 2018; ‘Best Trade Exhibition 12,000m² and above’ for Electra Mining Africa 2018; and ‘Best Africa-Bound Exhibition’ for CAMINEX 2018. “To be recognised amongst our industry peers is a great honour and we are delighted to have won the three AAXO awards,” says Gary Corin, Managing Director of Specialised Exhibitions Montgomery. “We believe that our continued success as exhibition organisers lies in our ability to adapt to meet changing market needs, the expertise and hard work that our dynamic and experienced team invests into each exhibition, and the continued support of all our stakeholders, whom we thank.” “Our thanks also go to the Exhibition Industry Alliance for this opportunity; not only to receive our awards, but also to celebrate awards presented to our industry colleagues.” Later in the evening Gary Corin was announced as the EXSA Hall of Fame 2018 award winner in recognition of his years of dedication and contribution to the exhibition industry. With over 22 years of exhibition experience, holding the positions of marketing director and chief operating officer prior to his becoming managing director at Specialised Exhibitions Montgomery, Gary is enjoyed by many for his integrity, honesty and zest for life. Speaking after the event, Gary expressed his appreciation to all his industry colleagues and said that “exhibitions are my passion and to be acknowledged in this way is a great privilege.” The next Exhibition Industry Awards will take place in January 2020.
