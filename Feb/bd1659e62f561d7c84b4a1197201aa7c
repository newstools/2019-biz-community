What the (advertising) world needs now…Set to challenge the status quo of the international creative awards circuit, the inaugural Gerety Awards of 2019 have been named for Frances Gerety, the copywriter who coined the slogan: “A diamond is forever," back in 1947 – still seen by some as the greatest ad campaign ever.In this light, the Gerety Awards are set to serve as a global platform for talent and support initiatives that champion diversity in the creative industries and recognise global talent, mentors and allies within the advertising industry.In doing so, they’ll be shining a light on those who “define and refine the standard to which advertising should be held.” Because truth be told, there’s certainly no lack of advertising award shows out there. What is missing, however, is a marked shift in award shows redefining their role, as much of the advertising industry is aiming to redefine itself in these tricky times.You know what I’m talking about.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/479206.jpg" alt="No matter the colour of your collar, #MindYourBusiness" width="120" height="120">No matter the colour of your collar, #MindYourBusinessNearly 30% of South African women have been victims of unwanted sexual advances in the workplace - 57% from peers and 26% from superiors, the very people employees look up to for leadership and inspiration...Issued by G&G Digital 23 Jan 2019<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475115-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The SheSays Cape Town founders are brand strategist Marina Tokar, content strategy director Anelde Greeff and senior copywriter Johannie Van As." width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: The untapped opportunity of female empowermentGlobally, the women's empowerment movement has reached a fever pitch. #Metoo has toppled titans in industries ranging from film to advertising to tech, pushing against the 'boys club' ethos prevalent in senior ranks...By SheSays Cape Town founders 23 Jan 2019So, welcome the Gerety Awards! Launched by Joe Brooks and Lucia Ongay, both most recently of the Epica Awards, the duo has more than 20 years' combined experience working for advertising awards and believe it is time to do something different. The duo comments: When we first started talking to key industry leaders about our ideas for the Gerety Awards, we were surprised by the passion and enthusiasm about this concept. This convinced us that what the industry needs now is a new kind of awards show.They add: “We are very excited about the launching of this award and the support from the industry. We are looking forward to a great first year for the Gerety Awards, with an amazing worldwide jury, set to redefine what is traditionally perceived as ‘normal’ for the advertising industry”.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/480638.jpg" alt="#FairnessFirst: Diversity behind the scenes makes for better reporting" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Diversity behind the scenes makes for better reportingOne of the basic tenets of journalism is to tell the true story.
