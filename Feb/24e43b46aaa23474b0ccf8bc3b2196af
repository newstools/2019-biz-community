Social.Lab will operate in Cape Town and Johannesburg, with a team of 18 media experts combining Social.Lab's paid-social expertise with the creative excellence of Ogilvy South Africa. “Social.Lab will be a 100% integrated offer, benefiting as much as possible from proprietary know-how, methodologies and technologies developed by Social Lab around the world,” said Chantraine. Yves Baudechon, co-founder and President of Social.Lab Worldwide, said that, with 15 agencies in 10 markets, and 400 experts, the company’s network is expanding rapidly, and South Africa is an ideal gateway to the African continent. “Digital is exploding,” he said. “Today, 86% of South Africans have a mobile phone and represent a vast ocean of opportunity for savvy marketers. Social media is not just another digital channel. It is the new mass advertising. We see creative content as the engine of modern marketing, and effective distribution as the fuel. Paid social media is key to this.”
