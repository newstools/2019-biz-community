Our aim is to demystify African inventory and offer it to advertisers, agencies and their trading desks in a way that ensures integrity, performance and transparency throughout the supply chain. Advertisers looking to purchase premium display and video inventory in sub-Saharan Africa have had a tough job in the past due to factors like the shortage of programmatic inventory and brand safety concerns. This has driven advertisers to either running campaigns on RTB exchanges or not making use of SSA publisher inventory at all. Our goal is to change that, starting with a great publisher like Punch Nigeria." Punch is a powerhouse in local digital media, reaching 6.5 million Nigerians a month (Unique Users) with an average of around 60.5 million pageviews. Advertisers can now run display and in-stream video campaigns using across the site, coupled with valuable 1st party audience segments.
