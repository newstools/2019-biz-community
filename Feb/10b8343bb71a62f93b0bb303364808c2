That’s why Viceroy, which has a rich heritage and celebrates over a century of tradition, prides itself in still remaining relevant across the generations.” With this in mind, Adams created a punchy, diamond-infused film that appeals directly to a more youthful, yet still sophisticated and proudly Kenyan market. “Inspired by the diamond-patterned ‘cage’ encasing the bottle, we wanted this ad to celebrate the kaleidoscope of forces – natural, cultural, social – that influence and shape Kenya today,” said Adams. “With so many visual elements at play, it meant the hard work was all in the post production. Buying into our vision, the post-production team of Stephen du Plessis (2+3 Post Productions), Blake Prinsloo (Static Black) and Nic Apostoli (Comfort & Fame) put in an outstanding effort. Each shot had to be meticulously designed and choreographed to work in the diamond template so that, although busy, the uniform structure and sequence holds the viewer’s attention without becoming overwhelming,” he said. “It’s also important to mention the excellent craftsmanship of both Kezia Eales (Art Director) and Fabian Vettiger (Director of Photography), and to thank the team at Singh&Sons... for having us dreaming in diamonds for weeks!” View the ad here: https://player.vimeo.com/video/312087175.
