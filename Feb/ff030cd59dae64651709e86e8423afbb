Set in three different decades, the advert directed by Dean Blumberg of Massif films, shows the beer’s consistent quality and cleverly brings to life how the beer has remained a significant part of South African lives through the years.“Amstel is a legacy brand and we wanted to make sure there was an authenticity in how transitions work between the various ages. We also wanted to make sure that it wasn’t just a matter of people presenting a beer to an audience, but actually living with the brand in the ‘80s; ‘90s; and how we’re still enjoying it today,” says Dean Blumberg of Massif. Senior brand manager for Amstel SA, Dimakatso Napiane had this say about the brand’s new TV commercial: “If you take a look back, you’ll notice how Amstel is about the singular man who’s going on a journey, who’s perhaps evolving or getting better at something but one part we’ve left out is how social our beer is. This is what we want to bring across with this experience.” Be sure to look out for the new TV commercial and enjoy the timeless journey with Amstel Lager.AMSTEL INTRINSIC 45 TVC Video 2019Extras BTS FINAL REVISEDAmstel BTS FINAL REVISED
