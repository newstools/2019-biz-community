Some even said it looked more like a commercial for Lux beauty soap than a plug for a political party.There’s no denying (colour me sexist) that the person in the ad – Rethabile Lethoko, a model and entrepreneur – is stunning. But, I do agree that her sultry poses were certainly more on the side of soft porn than hard politics.The ANC reacted to a lot of the fuss by releasing a longer (just over 90 seconds) version, in which Rethabile speaks articulately about what the ANC has done for the country, but also about the challenges facing our young people (ironically, some of them caused by the ruling party itself, but that is a debate for another day …) The shorter version doesn’t have that much nuance and does ooze sexuality a bit more.Having said all that, though, I must look at it from a marketing point of view. The ANC’s aim was to show a young, vibrant and sexy image. Something that its old frumpy leadership (male and female) are unable to do.The video is also unashamedly projecting an image of success and wealth. Logic might dictate that is not such a great strategy to use with your potential voters, many of whom are poor or struggling financially.But the reality of life in South Africa is that voters seem to like their leaders flouting their wealth – perhaps that’s why supercars, Range Rovers and Harley Davidsons are becoming the must-have political accessories for the party gatherings.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/481071-120x120.jpg?2" alt="7 ways for political parties to win on social media before SA's national government elections" width="120" height="120">7 ways for political parties to win on social media before SA's national government electionsFrom Donald Trump's tweets that make the news, to Helen Zille's jaw-dropping updates, and Jacob Zuma's videos on Twitter, politics have become a staple across social media timelines.

That’s why you take out your money. This ANC image is saying to voters: you, too, can be like this: sexy and successful. All you have to do is put your cross next to ANC on the ballot paper.So, the ad achieves its purpose. And marketing communication that achieves its purpose gets an Orchid, so step up and collect yours, comrades from Luthuli House.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/481014.jpg" alt="The image from MSC Cruises’ island getaway offer." width="625" height="361">The image from MSC Cruises’ island getaway offer.I had a reminder this week that a still image – even in our video-overloaded world – has the power to make you stop and stare.That’s what I did at a simple photograph in a print ad. It was Valentine’s-themed, with a heart scribed on the sand of a deserted beach. It says so many things without words. It says romance, it says freedom, it says beauty.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477420-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image Supplied." width="120" height="120">MSC Cruises' 3rd Meraviglia generation ship to set sail in November 2019MSC Cruises have celebrated the float out of MSC Grandiosa at the shipyard in Saint-Nazaire, France, where the ship is being built.15 Jan 2019And it tops a special Valentine’s offer, running in February, for MSC Cruises’ island getaway cruises. If I were looking to impress someone with my romantic side, this would get me going.And that’s what the best ads do: they hook you (via the great imagery) and then reel you in (with the good offers).I know I’m biased, but it’s good to see print advertising is far from dead. Lively enough to get an Orchid from me, in fact.And no, I haven’t been captured.
