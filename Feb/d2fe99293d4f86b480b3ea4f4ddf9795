As part of the line-up changes Damon Beard, an East Coast Radio legend, will move from his weekday 9am-12pm slot to host weekday evenings from 6pm-9pm. KZN’s favourite mom Jane-Linley Thomas, will trade her current 12pm-3pm slot to host the family-focused Weekend Breakfast show.East Coast Radio’s General Manager Boni Mchunu says, “Both Damon and Jane are long standing ECR presenters and have made substantial contributions to the station, each in their own unique way. While they will now have new slots, we are thrilled that they will remain a very important part of the fabric of our on-air family. Damon with his laidback and approachable nature will be the perfect fit for the evening time slot and we’re looking forward to the energy and love for KZN that Jane will bring to the weekend.”Of the changes Damon Beard says, “Loyalty means the world to me – so I’m truly grateful to those loyal listeners who’ve stuck by me, no matter which show I’ve done. 6 to 9pm will be all about amazing music and exciting conversations. Working early evenings will give me the opportunity to focus on my own business ventures too like my Bed and Breakfast in Ballito – ’23 Elizabeth’ and my social media company - ‘What, when and where...SA’.”Jane Linley-Thomas says, “I have been with ECR since 2004 and have loved every single second on air. The weekend show will be high energy, joy-seeking and a whole lot of heart! The people of KZN are very dear to me and their stories over the years have compelled me to start the KindnessCan movement. I will be opening The Kind Studio in March.”As part of the new line-up, Thandolwethu who currently hosts East Coast Urban will take over weekdays 9am-12pm. Weekend Breakfast host Stacey Norman will move to the 12pm-3pm weekday slot. East Coast Radio’s two flagship shows East Coast Breakfast with Darren Maule, Keri Miller and Sky Tshabalala and East Coast Drive with Bongani Mtolo, Mags and Gareth will remain unchanged. The station’s complete line-up will be revealed on 5 March.For more information or enquiries contact lisanne@ecr.co.zabRev('brev-be9443dc-c1b3-4295-aa14-8aed59a81ded', '>a/\<az.oc.rce@ennasil>"az.oc.rce;46#&ennasil:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<')
