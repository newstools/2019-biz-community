The supersized Reasons section is a combination of people who have supported VISI and who VISI has recognised right from the start, as well as some exciting new creatives who are shaping the future of design both in Africa and the world. VISI 100 is currently on shelves for R75 incl VAT. The brand is available online here:Web: https://www.visi.co.zaInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/visi_mag/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/VISImagTwitter: https://twitter.com/VISI_MagPinterest: https://za.pinterest.com/visimag/
