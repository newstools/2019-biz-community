Voo C Media Group has taken videography to the next level by employing artificial intelligence tools to maximise its videography services to its clients. This is particularly how we have remained the preferred service provider for Kaizer Chiefs, one of the best and most iconic sports brands in the world.Every moment is important in sports, from the recent tragic accident of the brilliant Wiseman Meyiwa, whose salutations are given duly, to diplomatic visits from international sports stars and bodies. For this reason, we’re always readily available for a shoot. After years of experience we’ve mastered the skill of a paced response to any clients’ needs. It comes as no surprise, in this regard, that we’re ahead of our competition in production and film.
