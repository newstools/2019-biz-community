In fact, all we need is love. OK, OK. Enough of the cheesy love song lyrics. But let’s admit, if it were that easy to confess one’s undying love in modern times, we wouldn’t have to resort to cryptic poetry embedded in melody. And as if that isn’t complicated enough, South Africans have 11 official languages to consider!? Cadbury P.S. has answered our prayers. This year, our favourite chocolate has made it super easy to say, “I Love You” – in each one of our official languages. The wrappers are beautifully decorated with South African iconography, and the P.S. logo displays a temporary modification: swapping out the Wi-Fi symbol for a bold heart. And for those millenials who feel the need to share their declaration publically on social media – the QR code is still there to allow you to work your magic. Chocolate. Tick. Beautiful wrapping. Tick. Valentine’s message in your language. Tick. Valentine’s Day - perfectly sorted in a uniquely South African way! Want to read about insights, trends and other cool stuff?
