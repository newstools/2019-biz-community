Their style is personal, they opt for intrinsically exciting, classic and unique possessions not to attract attention, but because they are a natural expression of who they are. And it’s something they are passionate about. The effortless styling of the new Corolla Hatch is definitely something that will ignite their passions. And, they may even become a little obsessive. That’s why we went with the pay-off line ‘Drive Your Obsession’,” Van den Heever said.The TVC features plenty of exterior and interior shots to show off the new styling. There’s a stylish guy and what we think is his glamorous girlfriend cruising the streets in the Corolla Hatch… all is good with the world until he starts dialling up the volume. Then, his eyes meet the eyes of a guy standing at a bus stop with a look of horror on his face. Just as Bus Stop Guy’s about to scream, he wakes up in his bed in a cold sweat. His beautiful wife – who we now recognise as the ‘girlfriend’ in the dream – comes into frame and tries to calm him. She asks: “What’s wrong? Bad dream?” Bus Stop Guy responds horrified: “Someone was driving my Corolla again...”The ad broke in February. You can view the ad here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gv1v0aKwfh8&feature=youtu.be.
