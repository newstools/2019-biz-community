Tapping into the millennial marketThe millennial market is a significant demographic to be taken very seriously. This group comprises technology adopters with high levels of buying frequency, power and influence. Millennials gravitate to brands with purpose; therefore, a big focus for 2019 is marketing products that stand for something and solutions that give back to society. Organisations should spend less money on traditional marketing and advertising and, instead, focus on the social proof of brand impact and value. Testimonials and word-of-mouth marketing are credible and authentic sources that speak volumes for brand development, longevity and trust. 2. AI and data-driven insightsData is everywhere, and sales and marketing are honing into the endless possibilities provided through data mining to deeply understand customers, their emotions and buying patterns. CRM technologies that make use of artificial intelligence to build rich 360-degree views of customer lifecycles across multiple business disciplines unlock further customer possibilities. An example is consumer banking where home loan divisions are aware of every client's financial history, portfolio and potential and can target them accordingly, rendering every brand touch point unique and personal. Banking Institutions can, therefore, meet years of loyalty and good credits scores with competitive interest rates, and ensure that customers are not required to repeatedly provide their details to every division as the information already exists on their banking profile.  Another benefit of AI is that it caters to the instant-gratification of the Buyer 3.0 persona through next-generation technologies, such as intelligent chatbots, which enhance customer experiences and simplify complex interactions. A big wave of AI integration with mainstream social channels, such as WhatsApp, is also trending, rendering communication across multiple platforms seamless and continuous.3. Social engagementSales and marketing professionals need to monitor and understand customer sentiment, from product sales to service engagements, and need to remain close to their customers every hour of every day.Most CRM systems enable sentiment-analysis monitoring through social engagement, which empowers sales and marketing professionals to be proactive in gauging and influencing customer sentiment to change perception and increase customer retention rates.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/476100-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Godfrey Parkin, CEO of Britefire and of Angaza." width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: Brand building must become more about customer experienceCX is everything.

Mobile/voice search and voice assistantsVoice search and digital assistants are the new trends that are fast becoming the primary mode of search. The Cortana's, Bixley’s, and Siri's of the world, coupled with machine learning capabilities, are becoming more popular as their capacity for recognising human speech has improved significantly. By 2020 more than half of all searches will take place via voice search.Therefore, organisations should enhance their campaigns to cater to user search intent which is either informational, navigational or transactional. Gartner research predicts that by 2021, early adopter brands that redesign their websites to support visual and voice search will increase digital commerce revenue by as much as 30%.5.
