The month of March marks the advent of the first school holidays and also the second biggest consumer spend period of the year. A time when families with school-going children will take to the national roads as soon as the schools break up on Friday, 15 March.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/481434-625x312.jpg" alt="Why not crack an in-car activation with AutoReach this Easter" width="625" height="312">EASTER SCHOOL HOLIDAYS15 March – 2 April 2019Your second option is an AutoReach package designed to cover the Easter Weekend (19-22 April) through to Freedom Day (27 April) and Workers’ Day (1 May). Easter eggs are already appearing in supermarkets now that the New Year is in full swing. This will be a period where travellers are likely to maximise their holidays as they take full advantage of their leave. By taking six working days of leave one can reward oneself with an awesome 13 days away from the office. And again, the N1 north towards Polokwane will be marked by church-goers travelling to Moria for the Easter pilgrimage, as pilgrims do year after year.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/481428.jpg" alt="Why not crack an in-car activation with AutoReach this Easter" width="400" height="350" rel="">click to enlarge<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/481425.jpg" alt="Why not crack an in-car activation with AutoReach this Easter" width="400" height="350" rel="">click to enlargeEASTER WEEKEND & FREEDOM TO WORKER’S DAY18 April – 2 May 2019Plan you Easter promotions NOW, as we offer category exclusivity to advertisers and our bookings are managed on a first come first served basis.
