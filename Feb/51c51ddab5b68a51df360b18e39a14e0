The funny thing is that I'm not a morning person (so ‘5am club’… eye roll!) and ‘connect the dots’ is a compilation of stories from 20 amazing individuals without an MBA who started their own businesses... and I have an MBA. So, the message is clear; that my MBA does not matter and that I must wake up earlier ;) Thanks Rah. I’m also re-reading The Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, as one always needs a gentle reminder.I'm a podcast junkie on every subject and all things that intrigue me and I'm intrigued by a lot. I'm that 'why' girl. Constantly in search of different answers, new stuff, new thinking. I’m also on a ‘Childish Gambino’ tip. He’s doing nice things for me. Always on a Gregory Porter level. He sets my head right! Tell us something about yourself not generally known?I'll let you figure this one out.
