Each category of TOWER works towards the same goal: providing self-adhesive products that make your life easier in the workplace, at home and at school. The brand evolution of TOWER will also spur on the release of a series of exciting online campaigns â€“ including videos and photography that will be shared on social media - presenting the new look and showing off the product ranges for each of the TOWER categories. TOWER remains dedicated to making the lives of consumers easier from childhood to adulthood. For more information or to view the range of products call 0800 220 488 or visit www.towerworld.com.
