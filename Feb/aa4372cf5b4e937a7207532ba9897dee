It is a community builder and our brand has to reflect that. We pride ourselves in mentoring aspiring chefs by providing them with a platform at the restaurant to further expand their skills”. He added, “Having media powerhouses like Primedia Outdoor to support our mandate helps us to enrich our brand presence and connect with people outside Soweto”. Since its inception in 2001, Sakhumzi Restaurant’s popularity has grown over the years to become a natural pitstop for tourists and locals looking to experience authentic South African food and entertainment. Situated in the most visitor-friendly township locale, Vilakazi Street, the venue can cater for up to 2000 guests, for functions such as corporate events, birthday parties, team building, launches and year-end events, to name a few. To date, the famous restaurant has created over 700 jobs in Soweto and continues to provide mentorship to neighbouring businesses. The long-term objective of Mr Maqubela and his team is to change the perception that Soweto is a high crime area and he is well on his way to achieving this by continuing the positive work done at Sakhumzi’s. Jorja Wilkins, Marketing Executive of Primedia Outdoor said, “Primedia Outdoor is committed to accelerating community upliftment in our society. It is of importance that community initiatives and campaigns are exposed to the public with the intention of building awareness and visibility.” Sakhumzi Restaurant continues to bring ‘Kasi’ flavour to the people and create an environment that opens doors for memorable experiences. The well-respected owner of the establishment, Mr Maqubela, invites everyone to come and experience the elegance of township lifestyle – that is safe and fun.About Primedia Outdoor Primedia Outdoor is the premier provider of out of home media solutions within Sub Saharan Africa.
