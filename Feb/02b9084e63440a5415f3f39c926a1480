Online retail, in general, has seen some phenomenal growth rates and so has Zando. Over the past 7 years we have more than doubled our revenue and hence the business each year. This growth requires a lot of  'behind the scenes' work – as the brand and company grows so does the technology to run a company like Zando and hence innovation has been a constant key pillar of our business. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How has the Zando brand and offering transformed since inception?Zando started as an online shoe retailer; over the last 7 years the brand offering has grown to now include women, men, kids, home and over 700 brands across the board. The offering is not just limited to the brands on Zando alone, but also a diverse marketplace and e-commerce platform for a host of other external retailers. The 'non-visible' part of the customer experience includes heavy investments into your supply chain and operations – today we are operating our own customer service call centre and 3 different logistics centres across South Africa. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/482600.jpg" alt="Zando's coming of age" width="620" height="365">.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}As a South African fashion retailer in the online space, what do you see as your biggest challenges and opportunities at present?Challenges include: Lack of education around how to shop online.Internet penetration in South Africa is still a huge gap in the market.Distrust regarding payment and using credit cards with online retailers.Some consumers still want to touch and feel garments before purchasing.Opportunities lie in the challenges.

Another target is to continue extending our product offering to match the needs of all South Africans – we are aiming to have more than 1,000 brands online by end of 2019.
