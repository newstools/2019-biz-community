I’m busy working on a video about juxtapositions and this shot sums it up perfectly. I have a running joke with my mate @pauldanielvideo, who also took these magical images, about me being named ‘Sea-man’ because I have had a trifecta of incredible ocean experiences in the last week. First a whale blew its blowhole spray right into my face while shooting. Secondly, an otter climbed onto my surfboard with me while surfing and thirdly a seal kissed me on the arm while diving - these are all true stories as crazy as it sounds. Therefore I am like Spider-Man, but the ocean version. Long story short i couldn’t be happier.

He added that film is what he does, not what he is, yet what he does influences his films, so the two coexist. So his work life overflows into his personal life, with its surge of creativityTalking the surreal and creative surgesIn his 20 minute talk, Mace echoed the sentiment of ‘fibre artist' Danielle Clough, the March 2018 Creative Mornings Cape Town speaker, who said it's important to step away from the safety net and have the courage to try new things.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1804/435309-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#CreativeMornings: &amp;quot;Creative success from courage&amp;quot; - Danielle Clough" width="120" height="120">#CreativeMornings: "Creative success from courage" - Danielle CloughIn your own creative career, you often find yourself stuck in a comfort zone. At the latest Creative Mornings Cape Town talk, 'fibre artist' Danielle Clough shared that you don't have to be good at just one thing, as well as why it's important to step away from the safety net and have the courage to try new things...By Leigh Andrews 3 Apr 2018Mace added that embracing your otherness and vulnerabilities is the way you get ahead in life, no matter the platform you use to express that.For Mace, this took the form of creative short films. He looks at a situation through a new lens to gain a lighter sense of what some call dark, deep or uncomfortable emotions – that’s what fuels his filmmaking.

It’s been a long time coming! Yes I am going back to NYC, but this will always be my studio in SA. Thank you for all the help @luke_vey and @janettedevilliers.

Mace has met many like-minded people over the course of his short-yet-impressive career, and says collaboration is a huge part of his success. Through ‘feeling different’ and like ‘the other’ at school, the context has completely changed as people now approach him, not just because of his success but also because he has showcased his own vulnerability upfront. Collaborate and embrace your othernessThe power of otherness and collaboration is another common Creative Mornings Cape Town theme, as artist Chris Auret led attendees of the September 2018 Creative Mornings Cape Town session through an interactive process of seeing the effects of working together to make order of chaos in creativity.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/460709-120x120.jpg?2" alt="An example of Auret's collaborative work, from his ." width="120" height="120">The beautiful yin-yang chaos of collaboration in creativityArtist, maker and activator Chris Auret led attendees of the September Creative Mornings Cape Town session through a "collaborative art experiment"...By Leigh Andrews 2 Oct 2018<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1808/451750-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Ming-Cheau Lin.

It’s about going back to who you were before the world told you what to be. That’s how you make ‘the surreal’ real.
