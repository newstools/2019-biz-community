How did this idea come about? It started with a simple insight, which according to Nicole Glickman, Head of Copy at Brave Group, is that most South Africans during the Budget Speech are thinking about their own budgets, how the results will affect their back pockets and how they will reach their financial potential in the current economic climate. By harnessing the power and reach of electronic technology, “We wanted to shed light on the budget outcome by advising South Africans that Momentum's range of products, team of Advisors and services are designed to help South Africans respond to any challenges presented by the Budget Speech,” says Glickman. The execution This proactive opportunity was presented to client on Friday, 15 February, and it was all systems go. A set of creatives went to MMI Holdings, to engage with their economist and product houses as the Budget Speech was being delivered. Another creative team was on-site at the digital billboard, situated in Sandton's financial hub to capture the moments live and upload them onto social media.
