These three-hour sessions will be equipped with the latest insights and practical understanding that will provide specialised skills in some of the most competitive industries.The first Masterclass will be based on the theme 'Strategy Series: Strategising for Africa, think global act local'. The focus is on understanding the complexities of Africa within the global economic context and to explore some competitive strategies for success. "We are authentically African, as we believe there are huge opportunities in both South Africa and Africa at large, but we are also looking at the global landscape. We have an incredible opportunity to educate and mentor the future generation of Africa's leaders and managers by providing them with the tools they need to be true innovators and disruptors," says Professor Lyal White, Senior Director of the JBS at the University of Johannesburg."Day-to-day business in Africa requires leaders to focus on and deliver development with a direct impact on communities. The challenges we face present an opportunity. The fourth industrial revolution requires soft skills and humanism in leading and mentoring for competitive and progressive business performance. This is particularly relevant in Africa."JBS, established in 2017 as one of Africa's largest business schools, forms part of the College of Business and Economics at the University of Johannesburg. JBS offers a range of innovative programmes expertly designed to develop effective, ethical and enterprising African leaders. With an emphasis on contextual intelligence, leaders are equipped to successfully navigate and overcome the complexities of today's world, while advancing the evolution of the business environment for the benefit of their organisations and society at large.The school provides a platform to stimulate and inform purpose-driven business practices toward a collective impact. All programmes designed and delivered by JBS are grounded in the African context, with a strong global connection, for disruptors, entrepreneurs and managers alike. Development with an impact on the community, increasingly part of day-to-day business in Africa, underpins what JBS represents and does.
