In a statement, the company said “Bizcommunity.africa domain name sends a clear message to the world that the media brand is open for African business opportunities.” Bizcommunity has spent some two decades building a reputation as the daily go-to media portal for the curation and distribution of African company news, jobs and events across 18 industries. Bizcommunity says the launch of its dotAfrica gTLD presence will “enable the knowledge and resource sharing and intra-African networking required right now.”“African business news belong to the front pages and we are thrilled that homegrown organisations like Bizcommunity are showcasing the African agenda to the world. Incredible strides are taking place on the continent and it is up to likeminded Africans to come together and tell this positive story,” said Lucky Masilela, CEO of Registry Africa administrator of dotAfrica.Africa’s new home on the worldwide web is steadily making its way into the digital landscape of leading brands like Bizcommunity, Adams & Adams, ABSA, and many others as they realise the benefits of associating themselves with the Bright Continent and its one billion consumers.The rising dotAfrica domain name is increasingly being inscribed on traditional and new media platforms across the continent. “Economies today run on creativity and original thinking just as economies yesterday ran on coal and steam. The availability of a new online space is clearly proving valuable to brands, agencies and their respective marketing campaigns, as this latest dotAfrica launch by Bizcommunity demonstrates,” says Mr Masilela.“Africa is open for business and dotAfrica is our storefront. DotAfrica is the perfect platform to promote the one place on earth that still boasts the widest selection of natural wonders, coupled with the best promise of future growth,” concluded Mr Masilela.
