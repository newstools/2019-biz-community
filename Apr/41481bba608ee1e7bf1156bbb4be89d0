In a slick sleight of hand, President Ramaphosa, has acted with admirable haste to set up the various commissions, based on judicial recommendations.  However, with this said the president has largely remained almost agnostic on the salacious disclosures that directly implicate the ruling party, mostly claiming ignorance. Clever politicking or a strategic public relations campaign that seeks to sway the groundswell of public opinion conveniently on the eve of the 8 May elections? At the very least, President Ramaphosa’s actions are a distinct improvement on Mr Zuma’s fractious tenure.Ah, the Zuma years… a national disaster of gargantuan proportions and which effects will be felt for generations to come.  What has become obvious since Mr Zuma’s enforced resignation, is how he and his cronies sought to capture and destroy almost all crucial arms of the State – and unapologetically so, if Mr Zuma’s recent almost Damascene-type conversion to Twitter is anything to go by.One of the most divisive spin-doctoring ploys visited on the South African populace by the then-president must be the veritable calamity which characterised the Bell-Pottinger fracas. In their ham-fisted attempts to whitewash Jacob Zuma’s numerous infractions, and with scant regard for the very real racial wounds that exist within the South African lexicon, Bell-Pottinger unleashed what can only be described as ill-advised: the by now infamous “White Monopoly Capital” campaign.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1709/409288-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Original photo of the Gupta brothers by Gallo Images, republished with permission from Daily Maverick." width="120" height="120">Take that, Bell Pottinger: Guptas' PR firm given UK's harshest industry smackdownMonday's reveal of the results of an independent review commissioned by Bell Pottinger into its work on the Gupta account was quickly overshadowed by the announcement that the PR industry regulator has handed down the harshest possible sanction to the firm...By Rebecca Davis 5 Sep 2017This nefarious campaign, countenanced by Mr Zuma himself, was underpinned by Twitter bots, racially tinged websites and vitriol filled speeches. All in an attempt to divert attention away from JZ and his close associates, the Guptas. The direct fall-out of these actions does not bear repeating, given its still painful presence in our all-too-recent collective memories. In a clear case of Public Relations 101 gone wrong, we witnessed first-hand the unceremonious fall from grace experienced by the Bell-Pottinger coterie. Ostensibly hoisted by their own petard and deservedly so one might, uncharitably, say.And so, onto the Democratic Alliance. Where do I begin to unpack the many, many public relations misadventures that have befallen the opposition of recent months? The utter ineptitude displayed by the DA leadership in dealing with Helen Zille and her apparent appreciation for colonialism in all its incantations? The unmitigated clumsiness with which it dealt with Patricia De Lille and how this is very likely to cost them at the polls? Or its most recent bumbling of the fall-out associated with their election campaign that has divided our already fractured nation? It is my contention that the DA is in dire need of a new public relations advisor. Any takers?Which leads me to my point: does public relations have a role to play in politics? If one recalls the incredibly strong public relations machinery that kicked in around Barack Obama’s election campaign, one must, albeit grudgingly, admit there is most certainly a case to be made for it. Obama quickly realised that in order to engage with a young, largely uninterested electorate that would help win him the election, social media was most certainly one of the most powerful tools in his public relations arsenal. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1505/280195-120x120.jpg" alt="Tweeter-in-chief Obama gets own account" width="120" height="120">Tweeter-in-chief Obama gets own accountWASHINGTON, USA: "Hello, Twitter!

Six years in, they're finally giving me my own account..."19 May 2015Coupled with his penchant for actively engaging with his constituents via public walkabouts and door-to-door campaigning, Obama was a PR dream and the results were self-evident. Our own esteemed president seems to have taken a leaf out of Obama’s book which is evidenced by his, “Fraternising with the Masses”, constitutional along the Mother City beachfront. In the first few months of his presidency, this was a small touch, but one which absolutely resonated with the proletariat and established the prez as a man of the people.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/481071-120x120.jpg?2" alt="7 ways for political parties to win on social media before SA's national government elections" width="120" height="120">7 ways for political parties to win on social media before SA's national government electionsElection time is the perfect opportunity for political parties, and their leaders, to create a digital and social media strategy that resonates with their constituencies and keeps people engaged...By Mongezi Mtati 5 Feb 2019With the above in mind, any successful political public relations campaign needs to first and foremost understand the climate in which it is operating. Something which Bell-Pottinger did not comprehend nor appreciate, pushing its invective-laced agenda as it did and which the DA also seems to have misread entirely. Secondly, public relations needs to unquestionably steer clear of spin-doctoring in all its forms. Crucially, public relations, must also understand who their audience is, how to engage with them and establish the best platforms to do so – let the medium support the message.
