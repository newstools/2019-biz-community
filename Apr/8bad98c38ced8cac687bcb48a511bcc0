Most recently, her name shone as one of the most recent Standard Bank Sikuvile Journalism Award winners for her contribution to the country's society and democracy through the Gupta Leaks articles. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/458121-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The Citizen photographer, Jacques Nelles, named Upcoming/Rising Star. © Danette Breitenbach." width="120" height="120">#SBSJA18: A celebration of verified journalismThis year's Standard Bank Sikuvile Journalism Awards celebrated journalism and its contribution to the country's society and democracy with the Gupta Leaks articles awarded the prestigious South African Story of the Year...By Danette Breitenbach 14 Sep 2018As these were based on over a hundred thousand emails, they required sophisticated database analysis skills to explore them fully – that’s a prime example of a recent collaboration between several newsrooms, with the Daily Maverick, Amabhungane and News24 journalists working together. Thamm contrasted that to when she worked in the art department of the local media before the South Africa we now know. It appealed to her because what wasn’t being said by the media was being said on stage, as art became the place to challenge authority. It’s not easy work, but it’s necessaryShifting focus back to the current context, Thamm says while it’s not easy work, it’s necessary, as it’s all about exposing the truth in an era where there’s more ‘fake news’ than ever before.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1804/437763-120x120.jpg?2" alt="(c) Ventsislav Bratovanov -" width="120" height="120">The line between news and advertising is blurring, according to studyAccording to the Global Communications Report, 64% of public relations professionals surveyed predict that in five years the average consumer will not be able to distinguish between news stories (earned media) and promotional content (paid media)...20 Apr 2018Thamm shared the importance of corruption-stories through the years – just think of the impact of the Watergate scandal, largely confined to the US in the 1970s. Thamm calls this proof that “Fake news and bulls#it has been around forever.” Luckily, we’re now in a more liberal, connected space than ever before and there’s a concerted effort to bring those responsible for mocking the basis of Freedom Charter to account. Bell Pottinger was a case in point in this regard. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1709/412253-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Pay back the money Bell Pottinger" width="120" height="120">Pay back the money Bell PottingerAs the Bell Pottinger scandal dies down, the public relations industry in South Africa is reeling to pick up the pieces...By Regine le Roux 27 Sep 2017Unfortunately, Thamm says this was just one example of the constant attempt to manipulate the world’s emotions while corruption continues behind the scenes, often at the top level. From Bosasa to Steinhoff to the Guptas, there’s so much corruption and such big numbers are bandied about that most of us simply don’t understand what’s going on.Fighting the good fightThe good news is that we have a free press and dedicated journalists working on exposing the truth. Their strength is to sniff out the right people to speak to and access the documents that reveal the reality. Thamm says nothing she has written has ever not been published, and as TV viewers, we can watch anything we like. In addition, the whole tone and tenure of parliament has changed, where we can stand up and chant “Pay back the money”. We are often at each other’s throats but civil society rallies for a good cause. Don’t take these extraordinary freedoms for granted.That said, Thamm explains that she stepped away from the traditional news model in 2007 as she describes herself as feral, finding it hard to work in a corporate space. That’s why she enjoys the Daily Maverick’s ‘dark basement’ feel, with its dedicated team determined to fight the good fight.Without a free media, fake news would not be exposed and the Daily Maverick is a huge proponent of that. Thamm says it’s an organic, light-on-its-feet its organisation that’s beholden to nobody but its readers – it’s a funding model that stands out because its 1.8m unique users keep the publication alive. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475192-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Styli Charalambous, publisher and CEO at Daily Maverick." width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: The pivot to reality for news mediaAfter a decade of doom, and silver bullets that mostly fired blanks, the news media seems to be adjusting to its pivot to reality and acknowledging the death of the primarily ad-supported funding model for hard news...By Styli Charalambous 18 Jan 2019Those patriotic readers are part of a larger society based on civic nationalism, with the will to lead towards positive change together. Thamm concluded that there’s nothing wrong with individualism unless that means you don’t also see yourself as part of a greater community. She acknowledges that we’re at a dangerous point in our young democratic history, but she’s optimistic and says what happens after the elections on 8 May will be the beginning of something new. Thamm says to celebrate the freedoms we now enjoy, the systems that work and the whistle-blowers who have exposed corruption, often at vast personal expense.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1708/405014-120x120.jpg" alt="Luke McKend.
