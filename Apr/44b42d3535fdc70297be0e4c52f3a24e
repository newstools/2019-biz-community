<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/493301.jpg" alt="Wunderman SSA appointed by global healthcare company, GSK" width="625" height="466">The agency has been entrusted with four powerful brands including Grandpa headache powder, Calpol paediatric syrup, Voltaren anti-inflammatory and Otrivin nasal decongestant.Haydn Townsend, Wunderman SSA’s group chief executive officer shared, “This is the first big win for the year for our agency, and we’re thrilled to have the opportunity to work through-the-line with this prominent international company on these recognised local and global brands.Considered a heritage brand in South Africa that’s just over 100 years-old, Grandpa is so well shaped in people’s minds, and we have a great responsibility as its agency to maintain the essence of this foundation brand.”Calpol is the number one brand in its category. Voltaren is a growing brand that requires support to boost its growth trajectory, and while seasonal, Otrivin already holds competitive market share, but has the potential for further growth. Townsend added, “By using creativity, content and technology we aim to transform these brands where it matters the most.”Karel Viviers, GSK’s Africa Media Manager commented, “We have full confidence in Wunderman to connect with our target audiences in a way that is effective and relevant. They have demonstrated that even though they are part of a global agency network, they clearly understand, and are in touch with the local market; a critical criterion for the likes of Grandpa.”“The timing of this significant win is propitious in the context of the news about Wunderman and J. Walter Thompson’s partnership. It’s a superb start to 2019 and a prized client to bring into the new, joint agency,” concluded Townsend.
