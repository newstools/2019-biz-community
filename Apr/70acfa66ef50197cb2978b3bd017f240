The second one was podcasts and audio streaming; this was for a podcast that was titled ‘Poisonous Bullets’, which was around the political killings in KZN and the death of Sindiso Magaqa. Both stories have historical importance.On the Zimbabwe elections, it was the first time the country didn’t have Robert Mugabe present. In the compilation of the work that reporters do, it vividly illustrates the risk of what they go through in their everyday lives.Sindiso Magaqa’s story was brought to the attention of South Africans, the political killings that are happening in KZN.

It takes a lot of hard work. Newsrooms are becoming smaller and smaller and to be able to do in-depth podcasts that speak to the families and political players. For the reporters, it is a lot of hard work and if you listen to that podcast of ‘Poisonous Bullets’ there is a lot of heart and hard work that went into it, which comes through in the final product.

With the Zimbabwean story, the evidence is there with the video to tell, the live ammunition fired in the presence of our reporters, but they continued to do the work risking all.

We saw that with Sindiso Magaqa, the killers have since been arrested and are going to trial. We are also learning that people are finding more time to listen. Podcasts allow us to showcase the depth of our reporters in terms of reporting but also their creativity. It also gives our reporters time to do special broadcasts because in all our platforms it’s only bulletins but now we have additional content that can be converted into podcasts and this gives the listener a deeper sense of the story.  In conclusion, Mahlase said consumption of news is changing. "People don’t necessarily listen to the news at the top of the hour like they used to. They are looking for context, why things matter and they are always looking for more in-depth stories."For EWN podcasts are that great opportunity to be able to tell the story in detail and to allow for radio to be the theatre of the mind."Video is one of our big projects at EWN, that people always like to see."She said their online platform availed these opportunities. "We don’t only do day-to-day news; we do a lot of features to tell South African stories. We are more than a radio news platform. We are more than that."Follow Mahlatse Mahlase on Twitter @hlatseentle, as well as EWN @ewnreporter/@ewnupdates.
