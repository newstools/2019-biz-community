The synergy between Brave Group and the client has manifested through unique, creative above-the-line solutions, most recently being a proactive effort to bring about a more direct and impactful delivery of #BudgetSpeech2019 to the man in the street, and a TVC reflecting the journey that every person embarks on to achieve their life aspirations.Such work could never be possible without collaborative partnership, efficient account management, outstanding creative, and a strategic team, consisting of: Rob Van Rooyen, Chief Insights Officer  Thandi Mphahlele, Group Account Director Nicholas Bastiaanse-Burger, Senior Account Director Thibedi Meso, Executive Creative Director Partner, Brave Group Tumi Rabanye, Strategic Director  Sinethemba Sikonde, Account Executive“It is key to remember that our main aim is to create meaningful connections between brands, people and their communities through brave work. The brave ideas and work must find the right context, culture, product, organisation, but most importantly, the right kind of client who is willing to acknowledge that we both don’t know the answers but need to explore in order to thrive. Nontokozo Madonsela, MMI Chief Marketing Officer and the Momentum team are that group – and that makes magic!”– Karabo Songo, Group CEO at Brave GroupDoing brave work is in our DNA as an agency, and the key ingredient for achieving this is understanding our client, their target markets' needs as well as the fluctuating market conditions they operate in. By scrapping the traditional agency model thinking and building a brave team to create the next evolution in independent thinkers, we are well on our way to realising the infinite possibilities our partnership with Momentum can bring.
