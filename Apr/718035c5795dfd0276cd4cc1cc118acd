Where do you live, work and play? I live, work and play in Sandton – I’m quite fond of the north side of Johannesburg at the moment. Oh, and I do quite a lot of Cape Town, here and there.2. What’s your claim to fame? Not sure I’m famous just yet, but I used to walk down fashion week runways and pose for cameras as a professional male model while still in varsity – I can still pull the Zoolander Blue Steel look, FYI –before entering into the world of advertising.

Describe your career so far. A five-year rollercoaster ride – something similar to the Anaconda ride at Gold Reef City, but a bit longer, I guess…After studying marketing communications in varsity, got hired as a content marketer at a small startup owned by a lovely woman named Victoria Williams. I guess she saw a bit of potential in me at the time and took a gamble on me, but I guarantee you that I knew nothing about advertising at the time.

Let’s shoot some great content”⁣ ���� -⁣ ��: @worthathovsandwords A post shared by  Teboho Rasoaisi (@tebohorasoaisi) on Jan 23, 2019 at 10:51pm PST Right after that stint, I decided to study further and specialise in digital marketing a bit more through UCT, and get certified through Google. I then moved on to a lead generation and affiliate marketing agency, where I sharpened my paid media and account management skills. Shortly after that, I found myself in the influencer marketing space, pairing influencers/celebrities with brands for campaigns as a form of paid media at Arc South Africa.And now, here I am as a digital media strategist and campaign manager at Mortimer Harvey (MH) agency, preparing for an MIT digital analytics course with MIT, through GetSmarter.4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. Analytics tools (Ads Manager, Google Analytics, Tableau), raw data, my iPhone and a good pair of white shoes/sneakers.

What do you love about your industry? I love to see creative ideas take shape, implemented for campaigns and being rolled out on digital. Beyond that, I appreciate the digital space at the moment – lots of cool ideas are being rolled out brilliantly on digital. Oh, and the awesome finger food at award shows, of course – can’t forget that!6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. Pop out my laptop, open up Ads Manager, Google Analytics, Google Adwords or MS Excel – analyse and optimise campaigns.When I’m not doing that, I’m either preparing a media plan or doing research for an upcoming campaign.7. What are the tools of your trade? HP Probook, iPhone, analytics tools, MS Excel, interpersonal skills and a purple notepad (colour of notepad not by choice).8. Who is getting it right in your industry? Tricky question – the industry is so broad and diverse, quite a few agencies are doing well in different ways, and that’s the beauty of the game, I guess.        View this post on Instagram           The best way to optimise ad recall is through a holistic campaign, and nobody knows this better than our very own Digital Campaign Manager, @tebohorasoaisi. A post shared by  Mortimer Harvey (@mortimer_harvey) on Mar 27, 2019 at 8:04am PDT 9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. Diversity and transformation in the industry.Understanding the customer, especially in the online environment. So much data to analyse, which can provide valuable audience insights to inform content or campaigns.Invest in digital. It’s effective, measurable and has quite a high ROI relative to spend.Strategic and tactical thinking when it comes to launching campaigns.10. What are you working on right now? I’m working on two social responsibility campaigns, for two different clients. Unfortunately I cannot mention the clients/brands just yet!<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490530.jpg" alt="The IAB SA's #Bookmarks2019 Pixel for Purpose-winning #AlwaysRemember, by Mortimer Harvey for the Road Accident Fund." width="548" height="203">The IAB SA's #Bookmarks2019 Pixel for Purpose-winning #AlwaysRemember, by Mortimer Harvey for the Road Accident Fund.11.

Where and when do you have your best ideas? During my evening jogs and early in the morning, during my shower before work.13. What’s your secret talent/party trick? Chatting to everyone and working a room sharing funny stuff I read online, or innovative ideas.
