An industry I have a great love, respect and passion for. Three years ago I started lecturing at AFDA Cape Town campus and discovered another passion - I realised that I am a student at heart, that I adore being a mentor and so bridging young, dedicated practitioners into the industry. I am honoured to be appointed as Dean of Cape Town campus and hope to share my experiences as an actor, producer, director and scriptwriter with our future industry leaders," says Diaan Lawrenson. Diaan may be better known in South African households as "Paula", for her role in the role in the TV soapie, 7de Laan, but she has also very successfully mined her multiple skillset in the entertainment industry, working across all genres as an actor, producer, director and scriptwriter on a host of television shows, short films, feature films, theatre productions and music videos. Diaan also co-owns an award-winning production company called Jester Productions. Over the last 11 years her production company has been responsible for productions crossing all genres: theatre, corporate and industrial theatre and DVD production, film and television. Jester has been nominated for various awards including the prestigious Fleur du Cap, Naledi and Fiesta awards and management of Jester Productions have won various awards including SAFTAS, ATKV Veertjie, YOU Spectacular, Tempo, Fleur du Cap and Naledi Awards.
