Qurated introduces international travellers to the numerous authentic experiences the country has to offer through a series of photographs taken by renowned photographer, Erik Almas. By targeting specific tourism markets, the campaign aims to position Qatar amongst the top five travel and tourism destinations globally.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490223-625x387.jpg" alt="Disrupting advertising conventions: Grid launches global tourism destination campaign" width="625" height="387" rel="">click to enlarge“What this campaign has done is disrupt conventional tourism destination drivers through a rigorous strategic process to identify key proof points that will attract visitors to the country,” explains Grid co-founder and chief creative officer, Nathan Reddy. These proof points, he adds, have been overlaid with iconic attractions found only in the country to bring the essence of the Qatar experience into the spotlight. The campaign’s first television commercial, launched in late 2018, showcased a handful of Qatar’s most iconic tourism attractions. Its second campaign, grounded in the same positioning, launched in February on Qatar’s National Sports Day and features leading soccer team, French-based Paris Saint-Germaine, with whom Qatar Tourism Council has a strategic partnership. Focusing on their annual winter training session in Doha, the commercial, titled "Where the best get better", sees the players training in Qatar’s extreme desert conditions, in its state-of-the-art training and rehabilitation facilities and at the coast, highlighting some of the many iconic attractions found in the country. “The challenge with this campaign was to ensure that what is essentially a tourism brand plays a role in popular culture, breaks through the clutter and disrupts the tourism destination marketing space,” explains Reddy. “Driven by extensive insights we have created work that resonates with the target audience and successfully places culture before communication, in the process creating a brand that has both purpose and meaning, and that creates significant value for clients.”
