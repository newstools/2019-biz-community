PoPI Act (Protection of Personal Information Act)Although the PoPI Act has been signed into law, it’s not yet in force. Preparations are underway, however, and it’s advisable for marketers and agencies alike to be aware of the final regulations which were published at the end of 2018. There are already five staff members employed by the Information Regulator (South Africa) to manage this — so it’s just a matter of time. It, therefore, makes sense for us to start implementing the provisions in readiness.Key pointsHere are some key points that were mentioned by Danie Strachan, partner at Adams & Adams Attorneys:<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1711/418010-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The #monkeyselfie - who owns it?" width="120" height="120">Adams & Adams #Crammer17: insights into intellectual propertyThe Adams & Adams 'Crammer' session, recently held in Cape Town and Sandton, was aptly named as they crammed as much content as possible into the morning session in intense, 20-minute increments on the balancing act of copyright and freedom of speech as well as who really owns that IP...By Leigh Andrews 10 Nov 2017One of the most famous cases that led to a lot of the modern-day thinking about privacy was the case in the 1960s of a Mrs O’Keefe who was photographed shooting a gun. Because of the unusual occurrence of a lady shooting a gun — in those days, at least — the photograph found its way into a newspaper. Mrs O’Keefe successfully sued The Argus for publishing without her permission and the judge said that the publication hadn’t observed her rights to privacy.The PoPI Act was signed into law in 2014 and final regulations were published at the end of 2018.We need the legislation so that unscrupulous people may not access or sell our information.Some of the information is sold onto what is known as the “dark web”, where very unpleasant things are sold eg porn, drugs, guns etcPoPI covers:Processing of personal informationInformation entered into a record by or for a responsible partyInformation obtained through automated or non-automated means — which must then be in a filing systemWhat is personal information — how do we define it? Apart from the obvious things such as addresses, birthdays, identity numbers etc, it also covers facial recognition and biometric information. How does this affect CCTV footage, for example? How do the owners of any CCTV security footage prove consent? Or are they protected by a disclaimer?A lot still needs to be defined as we go along and as legislation is put in place and enforcedThe big change for marketers will be the “opting in” aspect which means that they will have to ask consumers if they want to share information as opposed to the current situation where consumers have to ask to “opt out”2. Self-regulation for influencersGail Schimmel, CEO of the newly constituted ARB, has been tabling a number of items to add to the advertising code of practice — the self-regulatory code for agencies and marketers alike — which will assist in the management of the communication around influencers.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/483235-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Schimmel says, “This turned out to be much harder than expected...”" width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with...

In that case, what needs to happen so that we know that a piece of communication by an influencer has been paid for?Consumers deserve to knowThat an influencer on social media is being paidThat there also has to be some sort of self-regulation to ensure that the content is trueAnd that, if something looks like an editorial, is that really the case or is it “advertorial”, which is made obvious in print media for exampleThat influencers might have been paid via a barter arrangement ie use of the product with some sort of testimonial in returnAs a resultEthical influencers will need to add an #AD or #Advertisement or #sponsored hashtag to their tweetsBloggers will have to declare their gifts from brands (ethical blogging)Parody accounts must be clearly declaredThe brand is responsible ultimately for any misleading content, and it’s the agency’s job to ensure that all content is signed off as approved by the clientAgencies and marketers must take everything they know about self-regulation in advertising and apply it to social media and influencer marketing — the same rules apply.If in doubt, contact ARB.
