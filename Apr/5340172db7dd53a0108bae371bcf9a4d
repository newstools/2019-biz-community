The wow factor of the campaign was in communicating a simplified direct claims process where the perception had always been that it was difficult to claim. The bronze award was for The Blue Train’s Surrender to The Luxury of Slow, a brand repositioning campaign that reimagined The Blue Train experience for high net worth leisure travellers and corporate entities. Speaking about the awards, Havas CEO, Lynn Madeley, said, “We are very pleased with the recognition, and really proud of the teams that worked on these campaigns. They speak to our elevated integrated offering as the Havas Village in South Africa, with PR working very closely with strategy and creative to create meaningful difference in the businesses of our clients.” Head of Havas PR, Larry Khumalo, said of the win, “Both campaigns bring to life the craft of PR and its continued evolution, and that to be recognised at this level is something we are proud of. From navigating a complex stakeholder matrix on the Road Accident Fund campaign, to establishing a direct and clear link of campaign success with sales on The Blue Train, these campaigns really led with the smarts to positively impact the businesses of our clients.” A team member from Havas’ media team, junior strategist Julia Ridderhof, also walked away with a gold award for Project RE, a campaign she did for the University of Johannesburg. Project RE is a sustainability project that challenges single-use plastic for a cleaner environment by way of community engagement through social media, and outreach activities. The PRISM Awards are hosted by the Public Relations Institute of South Africa (PRISA) and are the only marketing industry accolades dedicated to public relations in South Africa.
