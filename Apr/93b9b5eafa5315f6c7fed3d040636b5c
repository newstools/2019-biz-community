The Vuma Cam, Hot 91.9FM and Future City Fourways partnership is the next phase of this anti-crime initiative, with the installation of fibre-linked CCTV cameras, covering 25 intersections within the Fourways area as phase 1. It will also support and significantly widen the “boots on the ground” protection screen for Hot 91.9FM’s Johannesburg motoring community. Hot 91.9FM Managing Director, Lloyd Madurai, adds, “We believe the new Vuma Cam CCTV cameras will substantially improve safety and security within our community, provide real-time traffic monitoring as well as license plate recognition, feeding into law enforcement and POPIA-compliant security companies. The combination of the Vuma Cams and Hot Squad at intersections will provide one of the most effective suburban community protection capabilities in South Africa.” The first phase of this initiative is expected to be complete by the end of 2019.
