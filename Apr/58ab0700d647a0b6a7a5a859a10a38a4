Ciclope Africa is the regional edition of the international flagship festival held annually in Berlin. Ciclope recognises and rewards exceptional craft in moving image, providing a platform for directors, creatives, artists, producers and brands to celebrate brilliant work, share knowledge and be inspired. Ciclope has been hosted in major cities including New York, Los Angeles, Sao Paulo, Sydney and more, and is considered the world’s leading craft festival. 99c was integral in bringing the first African edition of the festival to life in Cape Town in 2018, where it successfully debuted at Zeitz MOCCA Museum of Contemporary Art. “We truly believe in the importance of acknowledging and celebrating the craft that goes into creating great work. A great idea is nothing without excellent execution, and this is what Ciclope serves to recognise, says Hylton Heather, Production Director at 99c.While there are many other local and international awards ceremonies, Ciclope is unique in that it celebrates the technique and skill required to achieve production excellence – which aligns with our own ethos as an agency.” Beyond being an opportunity to be recognised locally, the winning entries in each category automatically qualify as finalists in the international flagship Ciclope, which will be held in Berlin later this year. “Considering the calibre of talent in the country, we believe that it is important to facilitate and support initiatives which highlight our local talent, and help it establish its place on the global stage.” Additionally, 99c is proud to have been shortlisted in the Sound Design category for its acclaimed Spur Flagbearer commercial, ‘The story of Inam and Khwezi’. “In this instance the recognition is especially poignant as it was a collaboration with the brilliant director, the late Siphiwe ‘SJ’ Myeza, and one of his final projects before his untimely passing earlier this year,” says Heather.
