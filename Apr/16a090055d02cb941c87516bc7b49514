This win is testament to the agency’s ability to develop sound brand strategies with compelling creative ideas. Nedbank’s strategy is responding to the rising societal demand for purpose-led work, something that Riverbed has always been committed to as a guiding philosophy. While Riverbed has established itself as a through-the-line creative agency, and although there’s an ever-growing convergence of disciplines, PR is attracting more prominence, particularly when driving social impact. Riverbed is determined to play more in this space.
