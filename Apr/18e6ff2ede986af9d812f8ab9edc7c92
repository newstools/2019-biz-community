I failed to prep for it and went into the tutorial intending on "winging it" by talking about what I thought Silicon Valley was: The rise of plastic surgery and the pursuit of perfection due to media influence. Yup. I was thinking silicone as in breast implants and valley as in Hollywood. I was pretty much ready to get some value from all of those Dr 90210 episodes I had watched. Luckily the first person to start with their presentation had actually understood the topic and I had to hurriedly reassess my intended performance on the rise in breast augmentations and lip fillers.Now that I have bared my own soul and admitted to one of my spectacular failings - please enjoy some clients slight misunderstandings that have made our day!#1 GIGGLE-WORTHY:P+H: I'm just going to call the printer to find out about bleed and trim and then we will get right on the design for it.CLIENT: We are not anticipating anyone to cut themselves on it, so there is no need to worry about blood getting on them.
