It is the one symbolic and iconic constant that acts as both the first and last brand touchpoint for consumers. And yet, packaging is often the last item to tick in the marketing mix: frequently briefed in as an afterthought, off the back of an ATL TVC concept. Cadbury Fluffies is a wonderful example of how a carefully considered packaging concept can inform the above- and below-the-line executions - thus creating a full 360° campaign - the right way around.
