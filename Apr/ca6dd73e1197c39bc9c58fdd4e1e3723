The result The result was a highly successful two-week WhatsApp campaign that generated close to 8,000 video entries over two weeks. A number of the video entries were combined by Weatherman & Co, to create a video showcasing the “Beat of Namibia” that creatively captured the heart and soul of Namibia and the inclusiveness of the country’s Independence Day. Techsys MD Andrew Walmsley added, “Having a consumer campaign run on WhatsApp allows Tafel Lager to build relationships, provide valuable content, showcase specials and personalise messaging.”
