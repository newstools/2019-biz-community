Millennials do not want to invest with a company that has no “face”; they work hard for their money and are very cautious of who they give it to.Our responseTo listen to what the millennial audience was saying, and as a result, create youth appeal and provide consumer-centric information and messaging that would position ICEA LION as the “go- to” brand for wealth creation and protection.ApproachIn our mission to give the ICEA LION brand a relatable identity, we connected Kenyan millennials with some of the most influential and successful Kenyans via the #BackYourFuture campaign. No bots, just real people having real conversations around growing and protecting wealth.MessageThe key message we wanted the millennial audience to take away through the campaign was: “ICEA LION understands me, my dynamic life and diverse needs.” Getting leadership buy-inLeadership buy-in from ICEA LION was key – through it, we managed to convince the Asset Management CEO, Einstein Kihanda, to be part of our campaign. He was the face of an expert advice video series where no financial question was taboo. To pull this off, we worked very closely with our client and various teams within our agency, from client services to the development department. We adopted this approach from strategy to execution, having several intense brainstorms along the way. Better work comes out of collaboration and surrounding yourself with interesting, diverse people. People that challenge you. People that might have opposing tastes or opinions. Continuously questioning the idea behind #BackYourFuture is what made it a success.Results More than one million Back Your Future website impressions 200,000 website views 100,000 engagements
