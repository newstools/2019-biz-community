The end.” But there’s a lot more to it than that.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1403/181697-120x120.jpg" alt="[Design Indaba 2014] What's in the box Lauren Beukes?" width="120" height="120"> What's in the box Lauren Beukes?How does one define a designer these days? Designers are so much more than building constructors, typography poets and chair and vase crafters. Designers are creators, activists, humanitarians, revolutionaries, risk takers, visionaries.By Ruth Cooper 3 Mar 2014Having covered everything from HIV+ beauty pageants to gangland cops and great white shark tourism, Lauren Beukes has had a wealth of journalistic experience.And with novels along the lines of the genre-bending The Shining Girls, Broken Monsters and Zoo City, which have been published in over 20 languages and are now being developed for film and TV, and Game of Thrones author GRRM or George RR Martin himself describing her as “a major, major talent”, she’s definitely a shining light in the local publishing industry.But while she dreamed of being a novelist as early as the age of five, Beukes’ talk highlighted that it took a long time to get her writing career off the ground – it’s been a winding path with many bends, coloured by the stories of those she’s met along the way.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1707/404069-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Session attendees on the Nasdak.

She explained exactly why at the equality-themed talk at the latest Creative Mornings Cape Town...By Leigh Andrews 31 Jul 2017Who better to highlight the Creative Mornings Cape Town theme of being inclusive, as Beukes is living proof that when different people come into our lives, they bring gifts that enhance our own.She mentioned that the ideas don’t always flow and that creating is definitely hard. That said, by aiming for inclusivity through the following five steps, you can ease the process…1: Eat the worldBe curious, be engaged and connect with the world to ensure you’re writing stories that resonate with people.Creativity can definitely serve as a form of activism.2: Do something interestingBeukes said her experiences as a journalist have served as a backstage pass to the world. Use those experiences, but show something different – Beukes said she loved koeksusters, which are essentially ‘twisted doughnuts’, as that’s essentially what she does with the stories she tells.3: Get out thereReal life is often more surprising and inventive than you’d imagine. Do your research and remember to listen to people’s stories. Look for the pullquote in their dialogue and learn their myths.Beukes wouldn’t know about white cockroaches, which exist below ground as they never see light, if she hadn’t taken an underground tunnel tour beneath the city. 4: Give a damnBeukes' version used a more powerful swear word, but you get the point: People who include with intention, raise their hand to do the work of embracing what is unfamiliar.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1804/435309-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#CreativeMornings: &amp;quot;Creative success from courage&amp;quot; - Danielle Clough" width="120" height="120">#CreativeMornings: "Creative success from courage" - Danielle CloughIn your own creative career, you often find yourself stuck in a comfort zone. At the latest Creative Mornings Cape Town talk, 'fibre artist' Danielle Clough shared that you don't have to be good at just one thing, as well as why it's important to step away from the safety net and have the courage to try new things...By Leigh Andrews 3 Apr 2018Beukes says it’s incredibly difficult to separate the art from the artist. Understand that your work is an expression of who you are and your passions then follow them. That way you’re more likely to be telling the stories of real people – include their insights in your work, and work against the stereotype.5: CollaborateBeukes said: Others’ words are magic.Your truth is not the only truth, so weave them into your work (with their permission, of course), as we can blend the best of our wisdom with the best of theirs and can teach and learn from each other to produce closer circles that foster community and commit to diversity.Working with others helps overcome those moments where you doubt your own creativity.Overall, the Creative Mornings session brought home the message that inclusion is an attitude to consciously be open to ideas that come from outside of our settled ways of thinking or feeling. It’s about making a decision that comes from a place of love, of caring for others, of listening to their stories and telling them along with your own.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/480638.jpg" alt="#FairnessFirst: Diversity behind the scenes makes for better reporting" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Diversity behind the scenes makes for better reportingOne of the basic tenets of journalism is to tell the true story. But everyone's version of the story is shaded by personal background - and what if your background doesn't match that of the subject? It shouldn't make a difference, but it does. Here's why UK publishers are now hiring diversity executives...By Leigh Andrews 4 Feb 2019Because when you place inclusivity at the centre of how you live, it has great power to heal, elevate new voices, and change the narrative of who belongs. As diversity advocate Vernā Myers once said, “Diversity is being invited to the party. Inclusion is being asked to dance.”Let’s all strive to broaden our views and listen to others, in the hope that inclusion powers our own creativity.
