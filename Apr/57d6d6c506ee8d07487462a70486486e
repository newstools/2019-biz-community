This includes adspend during the crucial Christmas period and marked the 22nd consecutive quarter of market growth.  Advertising spend is forecast to grow 4.8% this year, with a further rise of 5.5% projected for 2020. This would push investment to over £26bn, completing more than a decade of continuous expansion for the UK advertising industry. These figures follow a report released by the Advertising Association last month showing export of UK advertising services had hit a record high of £6.9bn in the latest annual figures for 2017. The potential for growth was celebrated in the first-ever Export Month with trade missions in partnership with the Department for International Trade to China, Japan and the USA.Resilience amid uncertaintyStephen Woodford, chief executive at the Advertising Association commented: "These figures demonstrate, once again, the strength and resilience of the UK advertising industry during a time of political and economic uncertainty in the UK. They are a testament to the world-class capabilities of the third of a million people working in advertising and marketing services across the UK. With every pound spent on advertising generating six pounds of GDP, a strong advertising industry is a key pillar of a strong economy.   "With further growth predicted for both 2019 and 2020, UK advertising looks set to deliver over a decade of continuous growth. Like all UK industries, we hope to see a positive resolution of the Brexit situation, with business-friendly data, immigration and trade outcomes that could further boost this forecast growth". Overall market growth is being driven by increasing spend on search (up 14.3%) and online display advertising (up 21.4%), with further, but milder, growth predicted for 2019 and 2020.
