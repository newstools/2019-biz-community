Following the magnitude 7.0 Mw earthquake in Haiti in 2010, which devastated the area and killed thousands of people, the song was recorded in less than 15 hours by over 80 artists on 1 February 2010. It was produced by Quincy Jones, and executively produced by Lionel Richie, and Haitian-American musician Wyclef Jean. Artists rallied together, forgoing royalties, in order to raise money for aid in Haiti. International relations and co-operation minister Lindiwe Sisulu has appealed to South African NGOs, companies and individuals to make donations towards humanitarian aid for the people of Malawi, Zimbabwe and Mozambique affected by Tropical Cyclone Idai. Would it not make sense to have celebrities across Africa, especially South Africa, get together and create their own song with the purpose of raising awareness as well money for Mozambique?AKA and Bonang shared a romantic rendezvous in Mozambique a few years ago but all I have seen from them is a prayer hashtag.Music has the potential to make us feel connected to all of humanity.

It is believed there is a strong correlation between what the media reports and what the public recognises as relevant.Celebrities play an in important part in shedding light on an important social issue or cause and prompting people to act. People learn not only about a given issue, but also how much importance to attach to that issue from the amount of information and support a cause gets.
