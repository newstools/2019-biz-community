Knowing that this is an entrepreneurial generation driven by creating, owning and sharing moments and stories, the HALLS #OwnTheMoment campaign was born. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/494145-625x201.jpg" alt="Owning the moment: Techsys gives HALLS millennial momentum" width="625" height="201">The audience was invited to share their moments with HALLS: from the last-minute exam cram to the afternoon traffic carpool karaoke. Moments were shared through geo-targeting and curated online at a dedicated microsite.  A social share equalled the chance to win R250,000 in a Grand Prize Draw and select submissions were brought to life as billboard installations in the exact spot where they happened.The campaign microsite pulled in a whopping 32,680 visitors over a ten-week period. A total of 7,732 moments were created, 3,487 of which were shared on social media. HALLS was delighted with the results and believes the success of the campaign is due to its relevance with the target audience. Tyrone Beck, Creative Director at Saatchi & Saatchi SA, said, “If it’s not relevant they’ll switch off. This was a bold campaign that ticked all the boxes and moved us into an exciting new territory.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/494146-625x151.jpg" alt="Owning the moment: Techsys gives HALLS millennial momentum" width="625" height="151">Techsys Digital MD Andrew Walmsley says that the key with millennials is participation: “We needed to create an experience that millennials could be part of, sharing their unique perspective and integrating into the brand story. And of course, we needed to connect with them in their language – digital - which is what we do best.”Moment owned!Want to partner with Techsys on a project?
