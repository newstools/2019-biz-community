Surrender to The Luxury of Slow has helped catapult The Blue Train brand beyond the heights we projected, and the positioning continues to steer the business successfully.”He concluded, “This award is a validation of the excellence of the entire team at The Blue Train: from the sales consultants, the on-board personnel, engineers, and the team at Transnet who are custodians of this national treasure. It is also a feather in the cap for the PR team at our agency partner, Havas. We are absolutely proud of this achievement.”Lynn Madeley, Havas CEO, echoed Monyake’s sentiments, “We are very pleased with the recognition, and are really proud of the teams that worked on this campaign. The campaign speaks to our elevated integrated offering as the Havas Village in South Africa, with PR working very closely with strategy and creative to create a meaningful difference in the business of this national treasure.” The repositioning of The Blue Train reimagined and contemporised the brand to achieve an increase in market share both locally and internationally, and also to invite corporates to use The Blue Train as a preferred space for meetings, events and gatherings. Being the first in over two decades, this positioning has resulted in some great positive strides for The Blue Train, including increased occupancy and a sustained interest from various corporates in South Africa and beyond. The Prism Awards are the only public relations industry awards in South Africa, and this recognition is the highest form of validation within the PR sector.
