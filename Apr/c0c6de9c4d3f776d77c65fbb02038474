Tswalu currently comprises two entities: Tswalu Kalahari, an award-winning private game reserve in the Southern Kalahari and the core of its eco-tourism operation, and the Tswalu Foundation, a research, conservation and outreach organisation dedicated to understanding the Kalahari’s unique and under-examined flora and fauna. The rebrand will better unite these two areas, prioritising the latter as the main brand focus. “Tswalu is renowned for its work in the Kalahari, from both the research-based conservation and broader community perspectives. But now the brand is looking to expand and extend this reach beyond just the Kalahari. The vision is to export this incredible conservation thinking and experience to other at-risk environments in Africa, and help preserve these delicate African ecosystems,” says Gary Harwood, HKLM director.In shifting perception of Tswalu as simply an eco-tourism operation in the Kalahari to a significant African conservation organisation with an eco-tourism component, HKLM will develop a new brand platform to clarify Tswalu’s positioning for internal and external stakeholders; new brand architecture to create synergy between the conservation and eco-tourism businesses; a new brand identity; and a new website. A new visual language will also be developed and translated into various elements throughout the business. Harwood says HKLM’s extensive experience working with African conservation brands stood it in good stead to win the business. “HKLM has a commendable track record for working with Africa’s leading eco-tourism and conservation organisations,” Harwood explains. “We also have many years of experience working in Africa, and understand the continent better than most branding agencies. I believe these are among the core reasons we secured this project, which represents an exciting time for this renowned brand. We are honoured to be part of this great new beginning for Tswalu.”
