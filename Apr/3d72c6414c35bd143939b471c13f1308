If that seems impossible, aim for one really strong visual and your logo that speaks a thousand words.Contrast is keyWhen working with fonts, backgrounds, images, or colours, maintain a level of contrast that keeps your OOH design legible and engaging from a distance.One message onlyMake sure your audience knows the one thing that will get them to react the way you want them to. Too many messages or objectives will confuse and distract your audience from your desired goal.Make it a campaignAvoid using one design. Always enhance your message and campaign with multiple designs. There's nothing worse than being bored to death by the same design that covers an entire city. Keep consumers interested by showing all your brand has to offer.One point of contactTry to stick to one or less. It's hard to write a phone number down, so we recommend a just using your company website details. Keep in mind that people will just Google the company name.Short dwell timeKeep in mind that the average dwell time for a road time static billboard is approx. 7 to 10 seconds and for digital it is even less at 3 to 5 seconds. Keep your design short sweet and impactful.Some examples of effective OOH campaigns:<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490452.jpg" alt="Creative design work for effective OOH advertising 101" width="400" height="252"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490453.jpg" alt="DSTV OOH Campaign 2018" width="400" height="267">DSTV OOH Campaign 2018<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490454.jpg" alt="Uber OOH Campaign 2018" width="400" height="400">Uber OOH Campaign 2018<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490455.jpg" alt="Coca Cola OOH Campaign 2018" width="400" height="226">Coca Cola OOH Campaign 2018Get help with your OOH campaign by getting in touch with support@billboardfinder.co.zabRev('brev-f2e152f5-5d33-481b-aa99-a9fa8952df0f', '>a/\<az.oc.rednifdraobllib@troppus>"az.oc.rednifdraobllib;46#&troppus:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<') or contact 012 665 5933 and speak to Nolo to assist you with your design work at a small fee.
