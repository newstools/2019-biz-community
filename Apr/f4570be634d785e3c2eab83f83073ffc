Consumers make snap decisions using ‘mental shortcuts’ that are available to them – but memories are stored in a way that isn’t easily accessible. The challenge for brands is to create ways to create mental availability when a consumer is in the market for their specific product or service.Stay one step aheadThe lesson here is that brands need to realise that their customers are not constantly thinking about them and that to stay one step ahead of competitors they have to focus on making it easy to be thought of.With the assistance of evidence-based marketing, brands can make sure that they’re part of the consideration set when consumers consider buying specific products or services.Evidence-based marketing has the very real ability, through easy to implement strategies, to turn a brand’s growth trajectory around.
