Not only did iLobola Nge Bhubesi scoop the biggest award of all, but the digital series also walkedbv away with two other awards on the night. “iLobola Nge Bhubesi is a campaign that we pride ourselves in. It tells a story that celebrates the resilient spirit of South Africa. It is a story about love, pride, life, overcoming challenges and resilient spirit of a young South African man,” say Head of Digital at DNA Brand Architects, Ndumiso Ndlela. Lion Lager launched this campaign as an ice breaker after many years of silence. “Lion Lager had been quiet for a while and we wanted to relaunch the brand in a cool manner that resonates with consumers. So, a digital series made sense for this type of consumer,” says Sphe Vundla, Integrated Media Manager – Consumer Connections, Africa at ABinBev. “Being a part of this one-of-a-kind and groundbreaking production was really exciting for me. I could relate very much to the character I played because, like him, I’ve been exposed to the custom of iLobola and have seen some of my peers go through a similar journey. This therefore makes the wins even sweeter because this was a labour of love for the entire team,” says Bafana Mthembu, lead actor: Sipho. iLobola Nge Bhubesi also won:  Silver – Social Media as a primary method to lead campaign – Lion Lager iLobola Nge Bhubesi  Gold – Launch of a new product – Lion Lager About the campaign: iLobola Nge Bhubesi The pride of South Africa, Lion Lager took the second screen by storm with the launch of the groundbreaking digital series called "iLobola NgeBhubesi” as part of the relaunch of the brand and their “Lion is back at R10” campaign.
