A shining light in this regard, Digify Africa has won a Black Pixel for Best Contribution to Transformation in the Digital Industry twice at the IAB Bookmark Awards. Where the opportunities don’t yet exist, create themNomacala Mpeta, head of learning at Digify Africa, recently explained that they do so by creating programmes that help young black people create valuable and meaningful careers in an industry that is still largely untransformed. Mpeta explains:Young people have been born into a digital world and have a lot to teach the older generation. They also understand the consumer on the ground. In order to close the digital divide, we need to equip young people and professionals with digital marketing and content marketing skills… They have the talent but may lack the means or opportunity. They rarely disappoint.  Only in having a truly diverse workforce can we hope to truly connect with consumers, by making every effort to ensure our work reflects their reality.
