Do you offer them some sort of loyalty programme tracking their donations? Do you give them free biscuits and juice every time they donate? Do you lean into current affairs and launch a manifesto, and actually do everything you promise? Do you create an edgy character, bordering on being bad, who says it like it is? All of the above. Meet the Western Cape Blood Service’s (WCBS) ‘Blood Buddy’. He’s more than just a drop of blood hanging out with other clots, watching the footie on a plasma screen over the weekends. He’s mischievous, competitive and sometimes a little provocative. The Jupiter Drawing Room Cape Town took the WCBS’s character and gave him a new look and a new off-key personality. Lucas van Vuuren, ECD at Jupiter, explains, “Blood Buddy is ready to be a bit bad to get people to do good. He pushes buttons to get reactions and gets away with doing and saying the things the WCBS can’t say themselves. His behaviour and actions are always for the greater good though, to get people to donate blood. And his bold attitude and edge are what will make WCBS stand out and give donating blood the cool factor. He’s urging you to #BeBadToDoGood.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/494166.jpg" alt="WCBS's Blood Buddy would like to expropriate your blood" width="520" height="347">Jupiter leaned into the upcoming political elections, bringing him to life with a manifesto. Much like our politicians, he’s an unconventional spokesperson - the only difference is that he’s honest which makes him likable. At a recent 'press conference', Blood Buddy was recorded saying he wants to expropriate your blood and give you a cookie as compensation. Follow him on Twitter - @WC_BloodBuddy - and Facebook to see him reach out to politicians and various wards in the Western Cape to donate blood.
