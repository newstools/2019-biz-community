In 2015, Yandisa Langa was working as a security guard at Noordhoek Village when he noticed a shortage of fresh vegetable at restaurants in the area. He saw the gap to produce tomatoes locally and supply them to those eateries such as Food Lovers, The Food Barn, Easy Big, and Café Roux. That’s how Langa’s Mountain Tomatoes was born. In 2017, he was selected to participate in the International Entrepreneurship Dialogue and students assisted him in creating a bookkeeping system that it is still in use. “When you work with students and you are open about your difficulties, they will find a gap and help you”, tells Yandisa, who in the same year was awarded the first prize at YouthStartCT.The project is not only designed to offer students a great business experience but also an inspiring life lessons on entrepreneurship. Third Year of the Bachelor of Business Administration Justin Alexander says “By working with our Entrepreneur, I learned that problems notwithstanding, you can still succeed and make it to the top. Upon unpacking problem segments our Entrepreneur was facing, I realised how hard he had to work just to stay afloat financially, and the determination you need to have to go into self-employment and become successful. It takes sheer hard work and perseverance to do what an entrepreneur does, I felt inspired by it and acknowledged the contribution they make to the economy.”Are you eligible to apply?Eligibility requirements for this programme are as follows: A small business with a turnover of less than R2m annum The business must be owned and managed full-time by the entrepreneur The business must be based in the Cape Town area Commitment to 6 collaboration sessions Entrepreneurs must be prepared to share all relevant information about their business to assist the working groups to make informed suggestionsIf you are based in Cape Town and eligible  to participate, apply online now!Closing date for applications is 15 April 2019.
