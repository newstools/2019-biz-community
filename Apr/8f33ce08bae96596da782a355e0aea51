Each year over 1,700 college and university film students from all over the world compete for awards and cash grants, with films being judged in seven categories, four domestic school categories (Animation, Documentary, Narrative and Alternative) and three international school categories (Animation, Documentary and Narrative). The presentation ceremony is annually attended by a capacity audience in the Academy's Samuel Goldwyn Theater.AFDA has submitted films in three categories. AFDA Port Elizabeth's genesis group of postgraduate students' film, Isikhalo (The Outcry), directed by Loren Buchner and Sisanda Dyantyi, represents AFDA in the narrative film category. The animation category slot is taken by third-year AFDA Johannesburg film, Escape from Planet Zoid, directed by Bailey Spencer and Tanyaradzwa Musasiwa, and AFDA Johannesburg postgraduate film, Zomile Inyembezi, directed by Vutlhari Wisdom Mhangwane, is selected in the documentary category. "My team and I are honoured to be recognised for the hard work which we put into this documentary and we are forever grateful to AFDA for giving us the platform to express ourselves and create stories that we care about," says director of Zomile Inyembezi, Vutlhari Wisdom Mhangwane. She passionately continues, "This nomination is a huge deal and receiving it is confirmation that we are heading in the right direction towards helping more people in our communities facing different societal issues. It is an honour and it feels surreal. I'm so grateful to have had this opportunity to tell a narrative, highlighting the unfair policing of women's bodies in South Africa. I hope that Zomile Inyembezi reaches as many teenagers and youth members in society as possible. We will never stop sharing our stories and encouraging women to make their own choices regarding their bodies." AFDA Port Elizabeth campus Dean Michael Ivy has this to say, "I am so incredibly proud of my first-ever BA Honours in Motion Picture Medium students.  I am extremely excited and also humbled that such an amazing group of Eastern Cape individuals can together portray such a strong statement about consent within marriage through a film named Isikhalo: The Outcry.  Port Elizabeth and the rest of South Africa celebrates with our campus for being selected as the official entry from AFDA into the Student Academy Awards/Oscars." In 2006 AFDA won the Best Foreign Student Film award at the Student Academy Awards with the honours film, Elalini, directed by Tristan Holmes. A huge congratulations to all the cast and crew! Zomile Inyembezi (documentary, 24 min)Synopsis: Zomile Inyembezi is a 24-minute long documentary, centred on creating recommendations to break down the stigma surrounding abortions - so that South African women can stop self-inducing them or having illegal backstreet terminations. The documentary is divided into three segments. The first theme is "Stigma - The cause", the second is "Stigma - The effect" and the last one is "Stigma - The deconstruction". Physical theatre will be employed to show poetic translations of the themes linking to the narrative of the protagonist. Additional interviewees include: a public hospital nurse, vox pops of people commenting on how they feel about unsafe abortions and giving advice on potential recommendations pertaining to deconstructing the stigma surrounding them.
