Big Walk participants can also donate a pair or two when they collect their race packs, and they and their supporters are encouraged to bring along any shoes they can do without on race day, to drop off at collection bins at the finish line. The much-anticipated Discovery East Coast Radio Big Walk offers three walking routes (5km, 10km and 20km), as well as a 9km fun run. Participants will start at uShaka Marine World and make their way along Durban’s scenic promenade to the finish line at the Moses Mabhida Stadium. En route they can enjoy ECR DJs and live entertainment (with special attractions just for kids), take plenty of #HealthySelfies and get the chance to bump into their favourite presenters. “We’re making things even more fun and personal this year,” says East Coast Radio’s General Manager Boni Mchunu. “As KZN’s number one hit music station, we’re handing the mic to the people of KZN by playing music voted for by our listeners. “Leading up the race, listeners will be asked to submit their song requests via SMS. Then on race day, they can literally #WalkToTheBeat of their favourite tracks as our presenters read out their personal shout-outs. So, whether you’re a super-fit fan or someone who just enjoys good music and a day outdoors, the Discovery East Coast Radio Big Walk has a beat for everyone to walk to.”Maclean adds, “We’re also excited to combine so many important elements in this race: physical activity – which is essential for good health, good music, quality time with friends and family, being outdoors in a beautiful setting, and of course a very worthy cause. With place for 30,000 participants, we look forward to securing thousands of shoes to help those in need – and giving locals the opportunity to feel good and get moving – be it walking, running or dancing!” Entries for the Discovery East Coast Radio Big Walk are now open.
