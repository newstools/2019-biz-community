Created by FCB Joburg’s Creative Director Greg Cameron, Art Director Kabelo Mabaso and Copywriters Matthew Shafto and Kabelo Mabaso, the campaign highlights how – with Debonairs Pizza’s free delivery – South Africans can, well, have their pizza and eat it! <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/492138-625x178.jpg" alt="Debonairs Pizza reminds fans to take advantage of its free delivery service with new TVC campaign" width="625" height="178">“We don’t need reminding that times are tough. We’re all working hard, but it seems we’re earning less. And, we’re all looking for ways to save,” said Cameron. “One way is to think smart, and cut out those often hidden costs like delivery. So, we think twice before ordering a home delivery. Or we raid the rainy-day reserves to pay for it. Or, we add to our busy schedule by collecting it ourselves. “Skaba dom – ‘Don’t be Silly’ – reminds people that they don’t have to factor delivery into the transaction. Skaba dom means no scratching around for a delivery fee that they don’t have. It means no waiting in collection queues to avoid paying for delivery. It means delivery is no longer a service you have to pay for.. because Debonairs Pizza delivers for free.” See the first in the series here: https://youtu.be/MzR_rO9Ji_8.
