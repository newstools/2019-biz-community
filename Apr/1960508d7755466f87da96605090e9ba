We arrived at our apartment home, equipped with state-of-the-art tech features, which I must admit was very impressive. The resort is designed to provide a frictionless experience with no reception, no human intervention apart from arrival at the boom gate and the guests of course. One of the features to access the apartment building and all its facilities required biometric security. Here was the challenge, the biometric security system crashed for 2 days, and for most of our stay we had no access to facilities and had to participate in a scavenger hunt for a security guard to give us access to the resort where we resided.Here is the strange thing, I was more comfortable to endure the inconvenience of the system not working than providing the holiday resort with my fingerprints. This is why?My data: DNA sovereignty vs digital sovereigntyI don’t trust the majority of businesses with my intimate data as my entire life and livelihood is connected to my fingerprints. What guarantee do I have that my DNA sovereignty is protected and managed securely if my digital sovereignty and personal information is not protected in the current day and age? Many of us have been exposed by data breaches in the past by financial institutions, tech giants and even realty companies? The current state of affairs is that technology is evolving so quickly and the laws to protect our data is so far behind, it’s alarming. We’ve lost control of our personal data. Sir Tim Burners-Lee says As our data is then held in proprietary silos, out of sight to us, we lose out on the benefits we could realise if we had direct control over this data and chose when and with whom to share it.Building and maintaining trustThe Connected Marketer is a marketing approach we offer to our clients, specifically aimed to encourage businesses to be more authentic and transparent in their business practices.

Ironically, as systems grow and become more complex, it becomes easier to lose sight of those first principles.
