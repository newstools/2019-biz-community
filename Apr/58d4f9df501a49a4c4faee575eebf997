We commend the client and its agency for a tremendous execution as it speaks so brilliantly to the "Keep Walking South Africa" slogan. We specifically enlarged and reformatted the site to elevate it to create a new elevated notable point of difference. We trust client will enjoy an excellent ROI starting with the Cape Town Jazz Festival taking place in Cape Town this weekend with a large number of visitors expected to fly in to attend.
