A combined Grid and Openco team creates a formidable offer in the marketplace,” says TBWA\South Africa Group CEO Sean Donovan.The new entity, which came into effect 1 April, will operate under the Grid Worldwide brand and sees the 60-person strong team fall under the operational management of current Grid joint CEOs Adam Byars and David Cohen and Managing Director Masego Motsogi.According to Grid Chief Creative Officer Nathan Reddy, “the acquisition allows us to build on Grid’s successful approach of viewing creative as an investment vehicle for client brands as opposed to a cost centre”. “We are all about Investment Creative™️, which means value sits at the heart of everything we do. We have specialist creatives from all fields working seamlessly to deliver powerful and impactful solutions across all platforms. The Openco acquisition strengthens our ability to meet and exceed client expectations in a competitive marketplace,” says Reddy.Openco Managing Director, Melissa Daniels, will assume a TBWA\SA group role driving key innovation initiatives across the group operating companies.“As a group, we believe in the ability of powerful creative to move brands forward. With this move, we are now extremely well placed to bring businesses and creativity closer than ever before,” concludes Donovan.
