It is time for us all to vote for a better South Africa, a country where our leaders seek to foster social cohesion, inclusion and govern responsibly. As an active member of the South African business community we believe that in order to create a better future for every South African, we have to ensure that we all vote for it. As the #makeitmeansomething company, Grid Worldwide would like to urge any South African who was considering not to vote, to go to their polling station and make their mark in the upcoming general election on the 8th of May. It is the only way to ensure your voice is heard and counted for in the future direction of our country. #makeitmeansomething www.facebook.com/Vote4aBetterSA
