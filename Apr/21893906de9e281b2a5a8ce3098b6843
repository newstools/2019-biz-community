The takeover will include a change to the paper’s iconic masthead, from Business Day to THE Business Day - something that has never been done before, in the history of the newspaper. The takeover is being engineered by THE Glenlivet’s brand communications agency, Publicis Machine, which has been instrumental in developing the brand’s ‘THE’ campaign over the past year.Business Day is a natural choice, given that it is THE definitive business read, THE leader in its field, THE first choice for business leaders around the country. THE Glenlivet is THE definitive single malt scotch whisky, with credentials that include - being THE first licensed distillery in Scotland, THE creator of the term "Single Malt", and THE first brand to put the term “Single Malt” on its label. It’s also THE first and only single malt that inspired a whole region, today called Speyside - which produces the world's favourite style of single malt whisky.
