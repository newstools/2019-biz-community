Tractor, who own the exclusive media rights to the largest public bus network in South Africa are now able to provide clients with accurate data relating to the transit campaigns booked in the Cape Town region. The tracking is independently verified by Routemaster.co.za, a company appointed by the City of Cape Town to track the movements on the buses.“Selling bus advertising has traditionally been challenging as we could only work on averages when clients asked for intricate details on their campaigns,” says Remi du Preez, Sales Director at Tractor. He continues, “The City of Cape Town has recently installed tracking devices in the entire Golden Arrow fleet which is where we get the data sets from. We can now accurately tell the client where their adverts travelled, how many kilometres they travelled, how many hours they were active and even what periods of the day their campaigns reached peak activity.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490432.jpg" alt="Tractor Transit: We are now able to track your bus campaigns" width="500" height="289" rel="">click to enlargeLlewellyn Terblanche, who heads up Tractor Transit says, “The data has given us new insights into the medium; which we will offer, campaign specific, at no extra charge to any client that runs a marketing campaign on the fleet on an ongoing basis. This is the first line of offerings under the Tractor Transit division. The plan is to provide more innovations around the transit sphere and across all Tractor channels that deliver accurate, real-time and relevant insights on marketing campaigns to clients.”For more information about TractorTransit Tracking™ or their latest bus advertising packages visit www.tractortransit.com or alternatively email info@tractoroutdoor.combRev('brev-1003c33b-9b2b-44ae-885f-4ec45a2821ac', '>a/\<moc.roodtuorotcart@ofni>"moc.roodtuorotcart;46#&ofni:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<')
