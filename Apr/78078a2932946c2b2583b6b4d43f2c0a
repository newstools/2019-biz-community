His agency journey really took off after 2007 during his term as the Chief Operations Officer at full-service digital agency, Amorphous New Media, where he worked on developing strategic direction and online products for large corporate brands like Nedbank, ABSA, Cell C, Hollard and Steers. In 2013 Andre turned his attention to performance marketing as Chief Executive Officer for leading online media agency 25AM (previously Acceleration Media). Here he developed a diversified media offering that focussed on measurement and continuous optimisation across search, programmatic and social media. “Key to this was creating a unified view of the customer by breaking down the silos between media channels and ensuring insights from social media listening informed paid campaigns,” recalls Steenekamp. Major clients included Direct Axis, WesBank, Allan Gray, Sanlam, South African Tourism, TransUnion, Brand South Africa, MTN, KIA and Renault. Steenekamp says, “We have moved from the Customer Age, where consumers defined the brand, to the Expectation Age, where they demand more from brands and companies. This requires a data-driven approach and Mark1 are center stage with their deep experience in all forms of digital media combined with the creative offering of Mark1 Labs.”
