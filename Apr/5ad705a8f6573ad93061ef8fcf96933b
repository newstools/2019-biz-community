Produced by Joe Public, this cheeky campaign was warmly received by creatives who enjoyed the humour in an image and visual resources provider using no imagery whatsoever in its communications – only carefully crafted copy, delightfully packaged in a book of poetry. The campaign struck a chord with those all too familiar with the daily struggle of stock image searches – knowing that to find the right image, you need the right words. All poetry in the anthology was written using real image descriptions from the Greatstock image library at greatstock.co.za.  The beautifully printed poetry book was delivered directly to key creatives in ad agencies, design and production houses, locally and abroad. The same campaign won two Gold Loeries in 2018 for Out of Home and Print Communication. “We pride ourselves on being in tune with creatives in the industries we supply images services to – and these creative awards are a wonderful affirmation of that,” says Greatstock MD, Margi Sheard. Greatstock has become known over time for its bold and innovative marketing. This campaign continues their contrarian style. “The team at Joe Public gauged the essence of our company and translated it into striking work that is not only powerful and unexpected, but also raises the bar among our peers,” adds Sheard. “We’re deeply grateful to Joe Public, CD Natalie Walker, and writer Marjolein Rossouw. They’re formidable creative thinkers, and we just love working with them.” For more information, contact margi@greatstock.co.zabRev('brev-92864c69-a26b-4a9d-9fa8-21a974c579c0', '>a/\<az.oc.kcotstaerg@igram>"az.oc.kcotstaerg;46#&igram:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<') or call Greatstock on 011 880 2037.
