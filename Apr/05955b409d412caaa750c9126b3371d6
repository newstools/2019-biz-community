That's really how we're starting to identify just what is happening behind the brand and what is happening with the people behind the brand. And does that align with who I am personally and what I stand for with the future that I believe in?” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1710/414214-120x120.jpg?3" alt="Simelane and Cooper." width="120" height="120">#BODCT: Surprise!

So, when they're developing strategy for businesses, specifically South African businesses, there are three Rs that they like to keep into account.They are: recognition, representation and redistribution and Cooper says these are really important facets to the South African consumer.Recognition - an awareness of who the consumer is as a citizen. “I think we're only starting to find our new identities in South Africa, post-apartheid and we have to take that into account that each citizen is just finding out who they are now.”Representation - that all levels of the business are represented in core groups and that there's active and meaningful representation. “This is really specific when we speak about women and when I speak about women, I speak about 'womxn' with an 'x' in the word. It's not women in general, it's people who identify as a woman.”Redistribution - how is this going to impact our economy? “How is it going to make a difference to our community? Is it something that has longevity or is it going to harm the way in which we live?”Women empowermentCooper says it's also really about how far women empowerment has come. Over the past couple of years, we've seen the fourth wave, neo-feminism rise. She says it's evident if we look at the #MeToo movement, Harvey Weinstein and what's happening in the world and the profound ripple effect that it's having on our community here in South Africa and specifically for women or 'womxn'. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1710/414809-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image source: ©" width="120" height="120">#MeToo trends in SA as women share stories of sexual harassmentOver the weekend, actress Alyssa Milano encouraged women to tweet the hashtag #MeToo if they had ever been sexually harassed, assaulted, or abused - and by Tuesday morning it was trending in the top spot in South Africa...By Julia Breakey 17 Oct 2017“One of the things I really believe in is the idea of brands really taking a stand. This is something that consumers are demanding more of. If I'm going to align with the brand's personality, I want to know what it stands for. You saw that with the Colin Kaepernick Nike campaign where people wanted to boycott it as a result but we also saw a lot of people in support of that, wearing Nike on the red carpet. But I also think what they did with Caster Semenya was incredible.”When we look at popular culture, we're starting to see what's happening especially on Twitter where we're able to have conversations with other women, asking them, 'Are you feeling the same way as me?'“I can see how the standard of beauty has been altered because of technology because we're taking pictures of their stretch marks and other women were going, ‘Actually, I have those too and maybe it's not such a bad thing.’ So, technology has really changed things for women because now we are a community and not just in our own geographical boundaries but to reach out and really communicate with women. Social media has had this profound effect on people that didn't have a voice in the past.” Cooper mentioned the recent issue with Woolworths and their Valentine's campaign, which got a lot of public criticism and then, as a result, the campaign was pulled. She says the amount of money that could have been saved on an entire campaign would have been substantial if they just had the diversity in that workspace; if they just had people that weren't heterosexual; people that weren't female stereotypes; people that weren't male stereotypes. In this case, social media rose up and demanded that it was pulled down. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/481043-120x120.jpg?1" alt="Woolworths pulls &amp;quot;gender stereotyping&amp;quot; Valentine's Day campaign" width="120" height="120">Woolworths pulls "gender stereotyping" Valentine's Day campaign#NEWSWATCH: Woolworths has pulled its in-store #LoveAlwaysWins Valentine's Day campaign following social media outrage, this just a few weeks after the retailer's Ubuntu Baba scandal...5 Feb 2019She also mentioned documentaries such as Surviving R Kelly, Leaving Neverland and Fyre Festival. “Really what is happening is that people are taking charge and realising that if something is not happening then we're going to speak about it and then something is going to happen. So, because we have these platforms to engage with women and because we're able to communicate directly with women, it's a really important conversation.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/487895-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Louis Vuitton pulls Michael Jackson-inspired clothing in the wake of Leaving Neverland" width="120" height="120">Louis Vuitton pulls Michael Jackson-inspired clothing in the wake of Leaving NeverlandLouis Vuitton is pulling Michael Jackson-inspired items from its autumn/winter 2019 menswear collection, as controversy mounts following the release of the HBO documentary Leaving Neverland...18 Mar 2019<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/479945-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image © Nextvoyage on" width="120" height="120">Anybody want tickets to Fyre Festival?There is an adage in advertising that says nothing kills a bad product faster than good advertising. Of course, that is assuming the product actually exists...By Damon Stapleton 30 Jan 2019Communicate with your consumersIt's quite ironic because Cooper works with a number of South African retailers and one of the retailers that she works with, one of their platforms had 70,000 followers on Facebook. But they hadn't spoken to their consumers. “That 70,000 people wanting to speak to them and they were ignoring them.” She said that the first thing they usually ask brands is, 'Have you spoken to your consumers? Have you tweeted them, have you spoke to them on Facebook? Have you engaged with them?' And a lot of them are just petrified of taking that first step and opening that communication. The irony is that communication happens anyway so you may as well be a part of that conversation and it's really important to lead that conversation.Cooper said one of the biggest trends is personalisation, customisation and creolisation or identifying your consumer as a real person: as a woman, as a man and as an African.It's really about how do you customise information; how do you customise branding and advertising to actually start speaking to active consumers.Cooper ended off and said that a lot of the time while working with beauty brands, she sees them using a copy-and-paste approach of a European, white female with pale skin and blue eyes and then they wonder why the consumer is not responding. “Well because they don't see themselves in it,” she says. "So, a lot of the times we fight with global brands to give them the information to take to their global marketing space to say, 'Actually, we need to generate new content that represents the people on this continent, the people of South Africa and woman specifically.'"Some essential truths that brands should really consider if they want to effectively communicate with their consumers.
