Direct brands connect and commercially engage with their customers directly – digital platforms are at the core of both their operations and their communications. They typically create value through low-barrier, capital flexible, leased or rented supply chains, with value extraction accomplished primarily through these direct relationships.The operating and financial models demand a new way of working that is here (now!) and it is exponentially changing the business process to do good business. It is also fundamentally changing the skills we need to be relevant and the education required to do so, as automation and machine learning take their place in our daily lives. UCook in South Africa is a great example and founder David Torr will be addressing 10 key learnings, as part of our 10x10 DBE format..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How does it work? To create an energised and interactive format that delivers insights to empower the media and marketing industry to thrive in the digital economy, the 10x10 format creates a space for a selection of our Summit speakers to share short bursts of insights from their experience leading in the direct brand and digital economy. They will share 10 values, principles or lessons they have learned with 10 slides in 10 minutes. Our Summit audience will walk away with 30 new insights in 30 minutes in this segment of the Summit. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What's happening on the IAB Summit fringe? Outside of the auditorium where the speakers share their insights – we also have a few interactive experiences to deliver on our Summit objectives. ‘Interactive Pods’ to engage directly with the digital medium and learn more from our Summit partners takes place in our networking breaks, including the 10xbeta stand and Google’s virtual paintbrush. Bizcommunity’s BizTrends panel is also part of our interactive live content lineup to better understand and learn from additional experts attending the Summit..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why is it important that the event is interactive? As the Interactive Advertising Bureau, it is important to us that our Summit is not just a lineup of one-way communication but that we are also learning through interactions throughout the course of the day. This includes our ‘Interactive Up!’ segments, including YouTube specialist Special Effects Media, who will teach us to shoot and edit video on our phones, as well as Associated Media Publisher’s Cosmo deputy editor, Noxolo Mafu, engaging on ‘Ready to Shop’ and the role of interactive media in driving commerce between print and digital. Plus a few great prizes to be won. Of course, the networking over lunch and after the event has always been a big part of the reason we have such strong attendance at our Summit events.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/470722-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Szabo and Acquisto." width="120" height="120">The state of SA's social influencers with Special Effects MediaI spoke to the global and SA CEOs of Special Effects Media about the 'YouTube boom' and how digital content creators take entrepreneurship to a whole new level...By Leigh Andrews 27 Nov 2018.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are you hoping will be the key takeaways for event attendees and other stakeholders?
