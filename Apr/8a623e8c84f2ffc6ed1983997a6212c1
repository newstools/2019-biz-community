In addition, event organiser, Specialised Exhibitions Montgomery has introduced live podcasts of the seminar sessions, so visitors won’t miss a thing. “The best way to build on knowledge, industry trends and skill set is to open your mind to constant learning and to not be complacent. Our aim at Madex is to instigate learning and discussion amongst both seasoned marketing specialists and those new to the industry, so that the fast changes happening in business can be used advantageously,” says Nick Sarnadas, portfolio director at Specialised Exhibitions Montgomery. “The Madex 2019 speakers have been hand-picked for their ability to inform and inspire the marketing, advertising and design industry.” Discussions take place within the two Madex seminar theatres - The Fundamentals and The Marketing Academy - and the full programme can be viewed at www.madex.co.za, or by downloading the Madex app from App Store or Google Play.
