Within the group of 30 delegates from across Gauteng, these ‘artrepreneurs’ (artists who are entrepreneurs) represented their ventures from areas such as Devon, Soweto, Krugersdorp and Braamfontein. Delegates are introduced to unique creative methods for learning and content delivery which included music, visual arts and movement-based techniques for learning integration. Entrepreneurial venture or business expansion is, however, not the only type of development that takes place as the short course also focuses on enhancing the delegates’ personal development through confidence-building, persistent problem-solving, leadership and professionalism. “It is imperative that the delegates understand the importance of their roles in the South African creative landscape and how this has an economic effect on South Africa,” explains course facilitator Dr Dawie Bornman – a senior lecturer from the Department of Business Management at the University of Pretoria. Bornman has more than 14 years’ experience in the local and international creative sector. Furthermore he adds, “Gone are the days were creative entrepreneurs work in isolation without reaching the correct target market or market segment. Along with the artrepreneurs we use creative ways to encourage engagement or collaboration between different creative industries to ensure success not just nationally, but also identifying international opportunities for collaboration, exporting and showcases.” Various creative industries were represented through the delegates such as sculpturing, beading and crafts, musicians, actors, design and fashion. The course is developed in such a way that it assists the delegates from the early conceptualisation stage, to then register and start their ventures, develop or grow their networks and to sustain their various undertakings. Due to the popularity of the course, more intakes are scheduled in Gauteng for 2019, with the possibility of expanding the course to artrepreneurs nationally in other provinces. .kInstance-Body .kInstance-SubHeading{font-size:18px;padding:0px;margin:0px} .kBodyTableT table td {padding:5px;} .kBodyTableT strong{border:1px solid red; font-size:12px;}Click here for more information on Enterprises UP’s upcoming business management and entrepreneurship short courses and entrepreneurship and SMMEs research and advisory services.
