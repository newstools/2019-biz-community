Techsys Digital MD Andrew Walmsley noted that, “Extensive research was conducted to identify the best practice in the categories of functionality, design, sophistication and interactivity. These categories allowed Ceres and Techsys to closely align on the direction for the site.” Due to the regional and linguistic variations of the site a path was set for a phased approach. In the first phase, the global, South African and Trade sites (the distributors’ portal) were built. Next, the sites for the key SADC countries were produced and finally the roll-out plan extends to additional individual country websites.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/494725-625x151.png" alt="Ceres gets a new highly interactive website from Techsys Digital" width="625" height="151">The first three sites have been exceptionally well-received by Ceres and parent company Pioneer Group. The source of delight for the client is that all requirements were met and often exceeded, as the agility and flexibility of the Techsys team meant that many new unique features that were proposed throughout the course of the project could be incorporated.Want to partner with Techsys on a project?
