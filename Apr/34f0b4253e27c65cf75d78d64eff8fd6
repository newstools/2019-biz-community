ABM is not algorithmic software. It is also not list-based marketing. Nor is it remarketing and the clever use of cookies. While a successful ABM campaign might comprise these components, it is considerably more than the sum of its parts. ABM is the structured and strategic treatment of key accounts as markets in their own right. It is the traditional sales and marketing funnel flipped. And while it may feel counterintuitive to put a lot of one’s eggs (budget) in one strategic basket, according to a survey from the Information Technology Services Marketing Association, 84% of businesses using Account-Based Marketing (ABM) report that this strategy delivers higher ROI than other marketing campaigns.Give us your opinion here.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/492306-625x328.jpg" alt="The Africa Accounts-Based Marketing (ABM) Review 2019 - Powered by Digital Kungfu" width="625" height="328">Why it worksABM is the almost inevitable answer to a digital landscape that increasingly presents greater opportunity for insights and greater demand for personalised, precise messaging on relevant channels. ABM is to traditional marketing what spearfishing is to trawling. While the traditional marketing mindset aims to net as many fish as possible with the hopes of landing a few keepers, ABM is a much more strategic way to do outbound and requires planning, patience and precision. With ABM, instead of ending your campaign with a jumbled assortment of prospects in your net, you dive deep to get to your best catch first. Sometimes (and perhaps more accurately) termed “account-centric marketing”, ABM takes its cues from its target audience. The first step in any successful ABM campaign is the careful selection of target accounts based on a number of factors: buyer propensity, likelihood and estimated value of conversion and ability to reach stakeholders with personalised content. Buyer personas (and in the case of systematic ABM, actual individuals) are identified at critical phases of the buyer process and diverse stakeholder pain points are mapped. Personalised content is then generated and channelled to stakeholders, guiding each along a unique buyer narrative culminating in a common destination - conversion (and/or retention, and/or expansion!).The current state of Africa ABMMatt Brown, founder and CEO of Digital Kungfu, a purpose-built storytelling production company specialising in building sales and marketing pipelines for technology businesses, first encountered ABM in the boardrooms of South Africa’s leading ICT businesses. “While ABM was clearly on the minds and agendas of a lot of sales and marketing execs, a lack of executional expertise seemed the primary obstacle to implementation of an ABM programme,” says Brown. To explore this and other assumptions around the state of lead generation in South Africa further, Digital Kungfu has prepared this important market research initiative.“We hope to gain a deeper insight into what is and isn’t working when it comes to lead generation and ABM in the ICT sector, and as pioneers in the space, to explore the potential of incorporating ABM into our clients' marketing strategies to further improve ROI,” says Brown.
