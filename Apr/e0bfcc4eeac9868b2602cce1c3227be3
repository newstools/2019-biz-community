From the onset I knew my passion was within the marketing and communications industry, however, the question remained, 'How do I integrate passion and purpose?'.My purpose is to make a difference in society through being a servant leader in the development sector. As a result, I have been privileged to lead the marketing and communications of various NGOs.Prior to joining the development sector, I worked in an agency and I was responsible for various brands. I gained vast experience in branding, social media, brand reputation and stakeholder relations amongst others. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the judging process.What an incredible experience!
