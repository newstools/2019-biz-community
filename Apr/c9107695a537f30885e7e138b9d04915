As editor of Cosmopolitan South Africa, it’s important to me to leverage the brand’s media platforms to engage with our millennial and Gen Z audiences in conversations that matter. Our win was predominantly pitched around our February 2018 edition featuring Laverne Cox as the brand’s first ever transgender cover star. My team and I flew to New York to shoot the Emmy-nominated actress. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/489723-120x120.jpg?3" alt="#Bookmarks2019: ALL THE WINNERS!" width="120" height="120">#Bookmarks2019: ALL THE WINNERS!The 11th annual Bookmark Awards, hosted at The Forum in Bryanston last night, 28 March 2019, culminated in 142 winners, all truly representative of the South African digital landscape...29 Mar 2019On social media, the campaign hashtags #COSMOxLaverne and #SayYesToLove reached 17-million within 72 hours and the story went global with coverage on E!

The objective of the February issue was to disrupt hetero-normative ideas around Valentine’s Day and look at love in 2018 – including acceptance of self, others and non-binary relationships. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1802/427796-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cox of the February 2018 cover of Cosmo SA - now trending everywhere!" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: #SayYesToLove with Cosmo SA's Laverne Cox cover exclusive!Social media netizens celebrated Cosmopolitan South Africa's decision to place Laverne Cox on the cover, with their logo suitably rainbow-hued to show support of the LGBTQI+ community...By Leigh Andrews 5 Feb 2018The goal was to play a small part in providing visibility for the LGBTQ+ community, of which Laverne has become a revolutionary icon. The edition included an investigative feature on the 'corrective' rape crisis, a rainbow list of activists and allies who have spearheaded change in South Africa, debates about coming out at work and a fashion spread featuring important LGBTQ+ voices. Since then we like to think we’ve spearheaded many important conversations around topics such as why we need to end tampon tax, body diversity in media and ending millennial apathy when it comes to voting in our general elections<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/444406-120x120.gif?2" alt="#NewCampaign: Cosmopolitan SA petitions to end tampon tax" width="120" height="120">#NewCampaign: Cosmopolitan SA petitions to end tampon taxCosmopolitan South Africa has launched a petition to end tampon tax, calling all women to campaign against period poverty in South Africa...By Jessica Tennant 12 Jun 2018.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Elaborate on the importance of celebrating digital creative work in 2019. Why do you think award shows like these are important?It’s important for the industry to set a benchmark for excellence that we can all celebrate and strive toward. I am also a big believer in connecting with media creatives and sharing insights and knowledge, The Bookmarks is a fantastic platform to do exactly that..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Comment on the overall standard of digital work in SA. Is there anything you think the industry can improve on?The standard here in South Africa is high, we have incredible talent and exceptional creative work coming out of this country. It’s important we recognise that. If there’s anything to improve on I’d say it would be more collaborative conferences for sharing best practices and successful case studies..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Who do you look up to and admire in the industry?Gosh! A lot of people. Internationally I really admire the work the team at Cosmopolitan US has done around the importance of sex education in schools.
