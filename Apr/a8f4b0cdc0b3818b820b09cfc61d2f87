Station MD, Greg Maloka, who was inducted into the Hall of Fame at the ceremony held on 13 April, says that the awards stand as a tribute to the efforts of the Kaya FM team and showcase the depth of their commitment to empowering the market.“Ten years ago, Kaya FM embarked on a journey of cultural change,” explains Maloka. “All of these achievements indicate how we continue to shift the cultural needle. We are essentially connecting a hybrid generation – those that experienced two countries living in South Africa pre- and post the 1994 democratic elections. We are raising the voice of the Afropolitan market, and in turn have taken it upon ourselves as a business to educate about how to authentically communicate with this market but also highlight that the market was always present and has not just recently emerged.”Kaya FM walked away with the following awards: Best Afternoon Drive Show – Commercial Station: Uncaptured Best Business & Finance Show: Kaya Bizz Best Field News Reporter: Nompumelelo Ngubeni Best News & Actuality – Commercial Station: Today with John Perlman Commercial Station of the Year Bright Star Inductee: DJ Ke Hall of Fame Inductee: Greg Maloka“Our position as the leading commercial radio station in South Africa allows us to tell the story of the Afropolitan,” explains Maloka. “The Afropolitan has always been all-embracing and all-encompassing – it’s not a racial position, it’s about how red is your heart?
