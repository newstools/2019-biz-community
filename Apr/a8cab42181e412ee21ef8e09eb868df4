We all follow that one person hey? The setting depicts a ridiculous gallery opening with equally ostentatious eats which make for an uncomfortable evening out, especially when you are hungry which is the situation our main character finds herself in. Directed by Arcade Content’s Zandi Tisani, it’s a lighthearted piece that somehow manages to be both completely over-the-top and incredibly true to life. Although Zandi’s reel is loaded with dramatic music videos and brand films, a bold and distinctive sense of humour shines in her first foray into more comedic and performance-driven work.The ad was conceptualised by M&C Saatchi Abel creative duo Lubabalo Mtati and Bella Evans, under the stewardship of Chief Creative Officer Neo Mashigo. Edited by Evi Katz at Left Post Production, final mix by Audio militia and cinematography by Rory O’Grady, with art department and wardrobe styling overseen by Mica McKechnie and Koketso Mbuli respectively. About Zandi TisaniZandi Tisani marries a strong understanding of narrative with a commitment to powerful imagery.After specializing in screenwriting at UCT, she went on to be part of teams that won SAFTAs for TV scriptwriting in both Comedy (Those Who Can’t) and Drama (Umlilo).
