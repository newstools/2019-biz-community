Not only was it one of the most awarded ads of that year, when Millward Brown celebrated 25 years of AdTrack in 2010, it was named the Best Consumer Liked Advert for the Past 25 Years. It was followed by a series of ads then referred to as the ‘Ama-Glug-Glug’ TVCs.The new TVC was created under the guidance of FCB Joburg Chief Creative Officer Ahmed Tilly off a strategic brief from Strategic Director Kabelo Lehlongwane by FCB Joburg’s team of Creative Director Bonginkosi Luvuno, Copywriters Yenani Madikwa and Nhlanhla Ngcobo and Art Director Fezi Mpembe. It was shot in Johannesburg over three days by Tebogo Malope of Star Films and post-production was by Left and Geppetto’s.According to Lehlongwane, the South African fuel retail trading climate has evolved at a swift rate over the last 10 years so that retail fuel forecourts and convenience channels are operating in an extremely competitive landscape. Additionally, consumers have a very low loyalty threshold for fuel brands, and simply stop at the closest filling-station to fill up. “The challenge put to the agency was to ensure that the Sasol Retail Network regains a widespread marketing presence, reflective of its strong heritage brand,” he said.  “In a nutshell, we needed to distinguish the brand’s positioning and provide a compelling reason to attract customers to Sasol sites.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/491819.jpg" alt="Sasol invokes iconic SA ad in latest campaign from FCB Joburg" width="600" height="300" rel="/c/1904/491820.jpg?0" data-height="300" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="340" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/491821.jpg" alt="Sasol invokes iconic SA ad in latest campaign from FCB Joburg" width="600" height="300" rel="/c/1904/491822.jpg?0" data-height="300" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="338" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/491823.jpg" alt="Sasol invokes iconic SA ad in latest campaign from FCB Joburg" width="600" height="300" rel="/c/1904/491824.jpg?0" data-height="300" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="338" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/491825.jpg" alt="Sasol invokes iconic SA ad in latest campaign from FCB Joburg" width="600" height="300" rel="/c/1904/491826.jpg?0" data-height="300" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="338" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/491827.jpg" alt="Sasol invokes iconic SA ad in latest campaign from FCB Joburg" width="600" height="300" rel="/c/1904/491828.jpg?0" data-height="300" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="339" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/491829.jpg" alt="Sasol invokes iconic SA ad in latest campaign from FCB Joburg" width="600" height="300" rel="/c/1904/491830.jpg?0" data-height="300" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="339" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/491831.jpg" alt="Sasol invokes iconic SA ad in latest campaign from FCB Joburg" width="600" height="300" rel="/c/1904/491832.jpg?0" data-height="300" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="339" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/491833.jpg" alt="Sasol invokes iconic SA ad in latest campaign from FCB Joburg" width="600" height="300" rel="/c/1904/491834.jpg?0" data-height="300" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="339" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/491835.jpg" alt="Sasol invokes iconic SA ad in latest campaign from FCB Joburg" width="600" height="300" rel="/c/1904/491836.jpg?0" data-height="300" data-lwidth="800" data-lheight="343" class="gflipper-image" align="center">The agency’s strategy dictated Sasol’s re-entry into the marketing space had to disrupt the market by creating talk-ability without losing the core brand essence. Understanding the customer mind-set, emotions, buying decision, media consumption and patterns are paramount to the campaign’s effectiveness.The new TVC, ‘Sasol – The Ritual’, began flighting on April 3. It makes reference to Sasol’s previous successful ads - ‘Super 100 Glug-Glug’ and ‘Ama-Glug-Glug’. These ads highlighted the superior fuel performance while ensuring a humanised emotional element that connects with customers by being distinctive, memorable and lovable. ‘Sasol – The Ritual’ brings these elements to life while resonating with the modern age and staying true to the ‘Sasol Today, Sasol Forever’ tag-lines. It provides many good reasons – intellectual and emotional – for consumers to choose Sasol, even if it means driving a little further.Tilly explained the creative rationale: “Sasol’s technical attributes make it a superior fuel. Today we remind people who know us about the magic of Glug-Glug and we introduce Glug-Glug to a new generation of South Africans. It is hugely exciting and a massive privilege to be part of this story.”Credits:Client: Sasol Brand: EnergySasol Retail Marketing Executives: Mohamed Carrim – VP – Energy Retail  Audrey Jones – Marketing and Sales Services Manager   Tracy Roberts – Marketing & Communication Specialist Sasol Retail Leonilda Koster – Communication & Stakeholder SpecialistCreative agency: FCB Joburg                 Business Unit Director: Struan de Bellelay-BourquinAccount Director: Leandra Rajcoomar     Chief Creative Officer: Ahmed Tilly          Associate Creative Director:  Bonginkosi Luvuno                        Copywriter: Yenani Madikwa & Nhlanhla Ngcobo                                                             Art Director: Fezi Mpembe                                                         Strategic Planner: Kabelo Lehlongwane              TV Producer: Iolanthe Grobler                Production house: Star Films Director: Tebogo Malope Post-production: Left and Geppetto’s
