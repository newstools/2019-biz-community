List a few pain points the industry can improve on. Gender equality. There have been numerous reports around the gender equality topic, but to me, the most interesting one was the McKinsey&Company annual report ‘Power of Parity’ in 2015, on how advancing women parity can drive and contribute towards global growth.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/486538-120x120.jpg?2" alt="79% of global organisations still not prioritising advancement of women - new study" width="120" height="120">79% of global organisations still not prioritising advancement of women - new studyAccording to a new study by IBM, the leadership gender gap in the global workplace continues to persist because organisations have yet to make advancing women a formal business priority...11 Mar 2019Yet, in 2019, women are still under-represented. I feel that gender equality needs to be a priority, so we need to change the way we do things: The way we hire, as well as how we identify female talent, train, support, mentor and promote it.10.

Where and when do you have your best ideas? To be honest, it’s mostly at night, when I’m working at home – and when everyone in the house is asleep.13. What’s your secret talent/party trick? I love to sing. I used to sing when I was younger, but it’s still a hidden talent of mine…14. Are you a technophobe or a technophile? I’m no technology expert, but I’m very ‘for’ it.
