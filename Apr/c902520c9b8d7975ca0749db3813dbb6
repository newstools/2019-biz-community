He asked the church to pray for the country's leadership and said he was here to listen to and submit himself to the church's message. Bishop Marcelo Pires, leader of the Universal Church's evangelical outreach in South Africa, said he had challenged Minister Mantashe to receive a blessing today, experience the God of the Universal Church, and leave after the service having been changed. This was Bishop Marcelo's prayer for everyone: that the presence of God would touch and change lives today and they would not be the same ever again.Bishop Marcelo entered the stadium carrying a large container for hazardous waste with a danger warning sign on it. He explained: "This container is used for poisonous substances. If we drink poison, it will kill us. Perhaps your life is troubled because of the poison in it. If you doubt, are afraid, resent the success of others, do not communicate with family members, have anger, the desire for revenge, or have jealousy or hatred in your heart, you have poison inside you. If we judge others by the colour of their skin or their nationality, we are drinking poison. Before God, there is no colour, no nationality, no men or women - we are all the same. You need to remove all poison from your life and ask yourself: â€˜Who do I want to be at the end of this service - the same or different?' If you want to be different, you need to stop judging people. Today you have the opportunity to start a new life, but it depends on you. If you do your part, God will do His."Having made a decision to be free, the crowd prayed to remove poison from their lives, not to be angry, afraid or have doubts and hatred. They committed themselves not to judge others and to respect and love their neighbours. The stadium resounded with the South African national anthem which was sung as a symbol of national unity.A solemn and holy highlight of the Good Friday service was the arrival of the Ark of the Covenant which in Biblical times was a symbol of God's presence with His people. The Ark was carried into the stadium on a red carpet lined by members of the Youth Power Group holding South African flags. It was received with a trumpet voluntary and a silent crowd who stretched out their arms to receive their blessing. Bishop Marcelo prayed that the presence of God with His people would reverse all curses and remove all obstacles in the people's lives and that they would be blessed. He said: "The Ark went ahead of the Israelites and nothing could stop them. It is here today to awaken your faith and remind you that God wants to live in you. When His Spirit lives in you, you become the Ark and are invincible. But to become the Ark, sacrifice is required."The gathering sang the famous hymn Great is Thy faithfulness with Bishop Marcelo explaining that this is a hymn about faith: God provides everything we need, and renews us each morning. He said: "God does not fail. If you believe, you will lack nothing. Your life will be complete. Learn to trust God no matter what. Adversities will come, but they make us strong."The Good Friday teaching was the story of the crucifixion read from Matthew 27:45-54. Verse 54 reads: So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they feared greatly, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God!" Bishop Marcelo explained that the greatest humiliation Jesus endured was not His suffering and death, but that He left heaven and became a man who felt pain, hunger and tiredness. He made this supreme sacrifice for us. After His death, the soldiers recognised that something important had changed in their lives and they acknowledged who He was. Bishop Marcelo said: "The power of the resurrection is that Jesus came to give us life. If we surrender our lives to God, He will transform it. How? He will lead and guide you, He will give you ideas that will succeed and He will direct your ways. You will see His power in your life. I pray that none of you will leave here today without having been touched by His presence. If you listen to the voice of God and obey Him, you will be blessed like Abraham was and will overcome challenges. You will be like David who was made great through his confrontation with Goliath. Problems will make you great and famous. Do not doubt. When problems come, know you have a great God."Before the spiritual part of the programme began, the crowd was entertained by the Youth Power Group and the Universal Choir. After the spiritual message, many people shared testimonies of how their lives have been transformed since they came to the Universal Church and allowed the power of the Holy Spirit to work in their lives. Many have overcome substance abuse and long term addiction, while others have left their lives of organised crime where they were violent criminals and armed hijackers. All are now successful people who rely on God. Bishop Marcelo said: "They are free. You can be too!"The service closed with Bishop Marcelo praying for South Africa and all her leaders, regardless of their political affiliation, asking for wisdom, guidance and peace for everyone.For further information, please contact the church's public relations department on 011 224 3400 or pr@uckg.org.zabRev('brev-da6559dd-2386-4007-9d4c-1b5f1cfe496d', '>a/\<az.gro.gkcu@rp>"az.gro.gkcu;46#&rp:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<')
