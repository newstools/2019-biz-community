The #fortheloveofbooks project was initiated by OFM News and Rotary Club and aims to collect as many books as possible for children in Central South Africa. The Rotary Club received a consignment of books from the International Rotary Club and the books will be stored until a suitable date for handover. The most recent development in the campaign, is that OFM became involved as a media partner in the project, which involves implementing President Cyril Ramaphosa’s vision to take tablets to schools in an effort to give learners digital access to textbooks. Says OFM's Marketing Manager, Lindiwe Mtwentula, "We have met with the Closed Loop Learner Network - Omang and the Department of Education who has thus far rolled out the process of giving the tablets and thus far the following schools from Grade 10-12 have received the tablets: Vulamasango Secondary school in Bloemfontein, Olien Secondary School in Fauresmith and Phehellang High school in Parys; and many more schools around the Free State are yet to receive tablets." The president will be visiting the Free State on 6th of April to do launch the campaign at the Charles Mopeli Stadium in Qwaqwa. “Gone are the days of heavy backpacks. Thanks to the tablets, on which the textbooks will be pre-loaded, the long walk for many learners to school will become much easier. OFM is proud to be a part of this worthy cause and will contribute where and how we can,” says Mtwentula.
