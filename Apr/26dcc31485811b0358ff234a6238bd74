Content, once only available to consumers via traditional media platforms such as print, radio or broadcast television, is now accessed by consumers through a personal network of connected devices. Nielsenâ€™s proactive commitment to mapping out existing and predicting future world trends lead the group to conduct a Digital Consumer Survey across several countries internationally, including Indonesia, Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, Brazil, Mexico, Greece, Belgium, Netherlands, Ukraine, Italy, Spain, Turkey, UK, Bulgaria and now for the first time in South Africa. The online survey was conducted in South Africa from September to November 2018 and a sample of 1104 frequent online users aged 15-years and above was captured. Join us to unpack the findings and debate the implications to the industry and mingle over snacks and drinks.
