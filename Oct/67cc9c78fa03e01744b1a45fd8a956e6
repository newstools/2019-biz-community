The data show a dramatic shift to digital over the last five years; the internet's share of sector spend has grown 22.0 percentage points (pp) since 2013, to 45.5% last year.This is just above the internet's share of global adspend (44.1%). As a share of sales revenue, the sector spends 3.6% on advertising, rising to 6.7% among banks.Almost two-thirds of the $25.3bn in ad investment within the food category last year was spent on TV, nearly double TV's global share of 33.3%. TV spend in the sector rose 1.0% year-on-year to $16.5bn in 2018 but has dipped by 3.7% each year since 2013 on a compound basis.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/512908-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Erik Witsoe on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Global cinema advertising is second-fastest growing ad medium of 2019Early forecasts by marketing intelligence service Warc places global cinema advertising behind the internet as the second-largest growing ad medium in 2019...22 Aug 2019Print also accounts for a greater share of food adspend than is the case globally, with newspapers' (-2.6pp) and magazines' (-2.1pp) share dipping mildly over the last five years.Global advertising spend in the retail sector was flat in 2018 at $62.3bn. The $1.8bn in extra internet spend (up 9.1% from 2017) was offset by a decline in spend for all other media bar out of home (+12.7%) and cinema (+4.9%).Ad investment among the retail sector has tracked downwards in recent years, recording a compound annual growth rate of -1.8% since 2013. However, online advertising has become far more valuable to the sector during this time.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/488630-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Warc predicts that Google and Facebook will make $176bn from advertising this year" width="120" height="120">Warc predicts that Google and Facebook will make $176bn from advertising this yearWarc has found that of the $590.4bn spent on advertising worldwide last year, $144.6bn (24.5%) went to the Google and Facebook 'Duopoly', which equates to almost one in four dollars...22 Mar 2019Ad investment (soft) drinks to thatAt 70.0%, TV's share of soft drinks brands' adspend is higher than all other categories studied for the report. The $10.5bn spent on TV ads in 2018 was up 1.1% from 2017 and has grown at a compound rate of 2.0% each year since 2013 – bucking the global trend.However, investment in other media – chiefly internet – has eroded TV's share of sector spend by 4.4pp over the five years to 2018. Internet formats still draw a relatively small amount of investment, at 12.8%; this is almost three times less than the global level and is likely a reflection of how little e-commerce has disrupted the sector.At a top-line level, ad investment within the toiletries and cosmetics sector has dipped 4.1% each year since 2013 on a compound basis, to a total of $25.7bn last year. This is largely due to how this spend has been allocated historically: in 2013, TV accounted for two-thirds of adspend while print drew a further fifth.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/486548-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Gillette deodorant campaign '' by MediaCom Connections Tel Aviv is the most awarded campaign of 2018." width="120" height="120">Results of Warc Media 100 announcedWarc has announced the results of the Warc Media 100, an independent annual ranking of the world's most awarded campaigns and companies for creativity and innovation in media...11 Mar 2019Both of these media have recorded declining spend over the period, with internet (+10.7pp) and out of home (+4.7pp) gaining most in share but from a low base – depressing total investment growth in recent years.
