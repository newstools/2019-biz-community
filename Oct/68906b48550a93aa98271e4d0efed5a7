As more marketers see the value in a well-integrated campaign, they expect their creative ideas to transcend mediums such as out-of-home, TV and radio to social media, websites and streaming services.How can your brand make this crossover?While digital is instant, measurable and relatively cost effective, it is important to note that audiences have their channels of choice. To create effective campaigns that transcend digital and traditional, follow these insights.1.

Utilising a combination of traditional and digital platforms allows you to reach more potential customers through immediate digital communication, (which is active) and create brand awareness through traditional channels (more passive). But you must bridge the gap with a single-defining-idea central to all channels.2. Multiple channels of communicationInstead of placing all your communication eggs in one basket and hoping for the best, it’s vital to split your communication through different channels. This allows for different media formats such as video, static and print, but also reaches a larger audience through their preferred platforms. For instance, digital platforms will attract a new market as consumers prefer to do their own research on your brand, whereas traditional platforms cement the legacy of your brand through smart and effective creative.3.
