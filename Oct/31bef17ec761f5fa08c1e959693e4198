Where do you live, work and play? Gailey: Originally from the Eastern Cape, I’ve just recently left my larger-than-life balcony in Long Street, to move to the quiet suburban life of Vredehoek. I’m a true festival fairy, so you can find me frolicking in and around the city. I stay away from the burbs. No shade.Newman: I live and work in Cape Town and play anywhere that guarantees a cheesy hit to sing along to!

What’s your claim to fame? Gailey: I’m a ‘little human with a lottle sass’.  An aspiring artist and filmmaker since 11-years-old, I was an ‘influencer/YouTuber’ before South Africa even knew what that was. Some of my videos racked up over a million views, but I’ve packed up my selfie stick and ‘retired’ from that now. Newman: I’m secretly a Disney Princess. No really, I’m constantly breaking into song like my plotline depends on it – the OFYT team secretly loves it. Armed with a flawless Aussie accent on demand, I apologise in advance for getting that song stuck in your head. Ironically, I do have a background in musical theatre, so I also write and perform musical comedies. 3. Describe your career so far. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/518909.jpg" alt="Lift life!" width="625" height="326">Lift life!Gailey: I started at OFYT as a creative intern on their graduate programme when I was fresh out of high school, at the ripe age of 18 – I had no clue how to use the Adobe Suite. I count my lucky stars every day!Newman: Unconventional. Having graduated with a BA Live Performance from AFDA in 2016, I discovered my love for song- and script-writing. Fast-forward a few years and an original script later, I danced my way (literally) into OFYT to join the digital team as a copywriter. 4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. Gailey: My iPad and Apple Pencil. GAMECHANGER. Newman: Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens. But also breakfast food and show tunes.
