It tells the other side of the story: the trumped up charges and efforts by the highest authorities in Brazil to discredit and close the church, one of the fastest growing Pentecostal Churches internationally. The film reveals the truth and exposes the facts that the media did not cover correctly. Petronio Gontijo, who plays Edir Macedo, said: “This is a story about adversity, faith and courage.” He has been an acclaimed international actor for 30 years but said: “Nothing I have ever done has impacted my life like Nothing to Lose 1 and 2 have done. The filming was done in different locations, but the most meaningful time was that spent in Soweto filming Nothing to Lose 2. The whole community welcomed and embraced us. This was something we have never experienced and it touched and changed me and the whole team. We were eager to return for the launch to be part of this extraordinary community. God bless Soweto.”A poignant scene in the first film, Nothing to Lose, shows Edir as a child falling out of a tree because his deformed hand could not grip the branch. His mother comforted him saying: “You are not meant to climb trees, you will climb mountains.” This film shows Edir Macedo and his wife Estelle, climbing mountains, literally and figuratively. In 1999, in the midst of hostile and unjustified persecution, he climbed Mount Sinai for the first time, saying: “This was where God chose to meet Moses when he was seeking justice. At a time when I am enduring injustice and defamation, I too am seeking justice, I will cry out to the Lord for justice. I trust He will meet me there too.” And indeed He did. Following this spiritual campaign of faith, the highest authorities and most powerful people in Brazil dropped all legal cases against him and the church because they were groundless. Bishop Macedo said: “This is proof that when the authorities mess with one of God’s own, they mess with God Almighty.”The film documents controversial incidents which were misrepresented and sensationalised in the media. These unjust allegations resulted in members of the Universal Church being targeted, attacked in the streets and persecuted. Many of the allegations were trumped up charges used in an attempt to discredit and damage the reputation of the church and its members.Facing this onslaught of negative media attention, Bishop Macedo said: “You only know how strong you are, when being strong is your only option.” He repeatedly quoted from the Bible, saying even the Lord Jesus was persecuted unjustly, so this is to be expected. One of the most memorable scenes was on Mount Sinai when Bishop Macedo saw the star-studded sky and said: “It is impossible to count the stars. This is the same sky Abraham saw. God was with Abraham, Isaac and Moses and He is with us.” The overriding message of the movie is Edir Macedo’s unwavering faith, his selfless desire to evangelise the whole world and his quiet dignity and humility. The film launch in Johannesburg was attended by three Maasai warriors from Kenya, indunas from George Goch Hostel and representatives from different faith based organisations. The event opened singing the South African national anthem and making a human flag in the packed church in Soweto. Scenes from the premiere were broadcast on Brazil TV.Everyone who attended the launch events received a copy of Psalm 91 to read during times of affliction with a personal message from Bishop Macedo inviting them to send prayer requests to him.For further information, please contact the church’s public relations department on  011 224 3400 or pr@uckg.org.zabRev('brev-8681edf0-0c2c-4042-9621-afc07a4f7983', '>a/\<az.gro.gkcu@rp>"az.gro.gkcu;46#&rp:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
