Struan Campbell, Levergy co-founder, said, “We are proud of the work we continue to do for our clients and would like to thank the New Generation Awards for their recognition.  Our mission is to always bring to life simple, creative ideas that deliver maximum impact for our clients.  It is thus rewarding to have four different Levergy clients recognised across categories.  We appreciate them for the continued support and the belief they have in our work.”  The New Generation Social & Digital Media Awards are one of the most celebrated digital media awards in South Africa, honouring members of the industry for their innovative use of social and digital media, and cutting-edge use of online media and tools. “We are immensely proud of the digital competency and approach we have developed and the growth we have seen in this sector at Levergy in recent years.   We have what I believe to be leading methodologies and have recruited some of the industry’s best talent, not only in the sport and entertainment sector but in South Africa as a whole.  To be recognised at the New Generation Awards alongside South Africa’s leading digital agencies is immensely rewarding,” concluded Campbell.
