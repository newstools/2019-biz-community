<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/520802-625x358.jpg" alt="The GAPP Magazine takes West Africa over" width="625" height="358">One of the things that set The GAPP apart from other publications in the same sector is the fact that they focus on all aspects of the printing, packaging and signage industry because they believe that they are all interconnected. “The GAPP sees this as a united and inter-connected industry. This falls in line with the approach taken by many of the world’s leading trade exhibitions and companies in the sector. Many of the challenges and opportunities are the same in all sectors. In addition, the process of placing an image on a substrate is common or similar. This means that there is a lot of cross-over in terms of capabilities and skills,” says Vikesh Roopchand, publisher of The GAPP, when elaborating on The GAPP’s reasons for covering different sectors of the industry at large in one publication. The GAPP West Africa will be no different, it will give our West African readers information specific to their market and will help them make more informed decisions about which direction to take their businesses in. Since its establishment, The GAPP has endeavoured to be the industry’s go-to publication and has done so in Southern and Eastern Africa. Vikesh feels that this is the perfect time to expand. “Initially we will focus on Nigeria and Ghana, with the aim of spreading into other neighbouring English-speaking countries in due course. These markets are technologically mature but still have the potential to grow and develop. "We believe that through the magazine we can assist printers, packaging and signage manufacturers and suppliers to develop their businesses to the point where they can be on par with the very best service providers in this sector around the world,” Vikesh elaborates. The GAPP West Africa will be published biannually initially and will be available for global electronic access on www.thegapp.co.za, where readers will also have the opportunity to access The GAPP West Africa’s sister publications. The magazine is designed for West African markets using a careful mix of local and international content and it is compiled in South Africa by The GAPP’s expert editorial and production teams. Research conducted by The World Bank, Africa’s Pulse, shows that Nigeria’s economy grew faster in 2018 than 2017. Countries in West Africa such as Benin and Côte d’Ivoire also recorded solid economic growth in 2018. This points to the growth of the markets in West African countries and has therefore necessitated the launch of The GAPP West Africa.
