The economy is taking strain and load shedding is back. That's why Multi-Media Express (a division within the Multi-Media group of companies focused on providing cost-effective solutions) has a pioneering idea to ensure that your function goes ahead as planned. The "Pay What You Want" Party Package consists of the following: Speakers, two microphones, background music, 12 light fixtures, a small stage, technical crew and transport (within the Gauteng Area). Anrico du Plessis, Multi-Media Express' General Manager says, "There is no fixed price linked to the package, it is purely based on availability. The client makes an offer in terms of how much they want to pay and if we can do it without it influencing our offerings negatively, then we will do it at that price". Any additional requirements, such as DJ equipment, backline for musicians and AV elements will be charged as an additional cost. Anrico continues, "The client may want to spend R12,000? They make the offer, we look at things from an operational perspective and we will see if it's possible. It all depends on what the client offers". Why pay more than you want too for your next function - score some brownie points with your boss and secure technical for your "Year-End" function at an absolute steal.
