It needs to move out of research labs and into our everyday lives. Meet Tilly Lockey – she has bionic arms developed by a company called Open Bionics.There are an estimated five million upper limb amputees globally. Open Bionics is building and developing the next generation of bionic limbs and turning disabilities into superpowers.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1305/133707-120x120.jpg" alt="Designer prosthesis featured on Popular Mechanics cover" width="120" height="120">Designer prosthesis featured on Popular Mechanics coverAs part of a feature on 'alternative' prosthetic limbs, the June 2103 cover of Popular Mechanics features Latvian-born fashionista and singer-songwriter Viktoria Modesta Moskalova showing off her outrageously blinged prosthetic leg, which she describes as "a fashion item and art project."27 May 2013What makes Lockey’s arms different (compared to regular, humanlike prosthetics) is that they have additional modes over and above open and close. Lockey had to learn how to move between the different modes.Why? All bionic advanced prosthetic arms work differently. What’s more, is that they’re personalised in terms of sensitivity, they work on flexing and releasing muscles.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/471099-120x120.png?2" alt="Schalk van der Merwe, Rural Hand Bikes" width="120" height="120">The true cost of disabilitiesIt is well known that persons with disabilities are often disproportionately poor as a result of a combination of barriers...By Bridgit Evans 26 Nov 2018Multi-grip functionality – the Hero Arm “Think about all the things you do with your hands on a daily basis. These hands help me both physically and mentally,” said Lockey. “All the money used to go the aesthetics of the hands, how they looked and not how they worked.”Technology is not only changing how prosthetics work. Prosthetics can be heavy – something to keep in mind when developing bionic arms for kids. Growing up also means that hands need to be recreated and replaced yearly if that.Open Bionics 3D-print their prosthetics from plastic – this makes them lightweight and more affordable – the cost lies is the battery and the motors on the inside. A pair of 3D-printed bionic arms costs around 10,000 pounds (which often means a lot of fundraising is involved).“Now kids get excited when they see me. My arms look like something out of an action movie, like from Marvel. They give other kids the idea that their disability is their superpower,” continued Lockey.Lockey has added a few personal tweaks to her hands, providing customisation (and sometimes crazy feature) feedback, to Open Bionics over the last three to four years. Will prosthetics eventually offer features like projectors, a voice assistant, Bluetooth speakers and even Haptic Touch feedback?If Open Bionics has already created prosthetics arms that can do so much more than simply open and close in under five years, who knows what the future will hold.
