So what can we attribute it to?The question – is social media killing advertising? – is very valid, and before all the social media gurus get on their high horses, hear me out.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517183-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: DESIGNECOLOGIST on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">The don'ts of social media marketingAh, social media marketing - the buzz words of today...By Jessica Barrella 18 Sep 2019Earlier this year, two different campaigns – from entirely different categories – were brutally criticised on social media.Gillette’s call for the best men can be The first was the Gillette ‘We believe: the best men can be' campaign. A campaign that challenged men to be better men. It encouraged us to stop being chauvinists, to stop bullying, to forget the macho facades, it challenged gender inequality in the workplace and asked us to hold each other to a higher standard, to be kinder, gentler, more humane.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/480583-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Screengrab from ." width="120" height="120">Gillette's 'We Believe' campaign - is it the best a brand can do?Rachel Thompson, insights director at GfK South Africa comments on the recent Gillette "We Believe" campaign that urges men to be their best and leave behind toxic behaviours like mansplaining, bullying and sexual harassment...By Rachel Thompson 1 Feb 2019The backlash on social media was enormous, with men calling for a boycott of the brand. The YouTube video of the advert has had 29.5 million views to date, with more than 420,000 comments. The number of likes stands at 777,000 with double the number of dislikes (1.4 million).<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477699-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Gillette's 'We Believe' ad receives mixed feedback" width="120" height="120">Gillette's 'We Believe' ad receives mixed feedbackNEWSWATCH: Gillette has released a #MeToo-inspired ad called 'We Believe' that plays on its 30-year old tagline, 'Best a Man Can Get' to help put an end to 'toxic masculinity'...15 Jan 2019On Twitter, the debate got even more heated with Piers Morgan – who is never far from controversy – declaring that he would no longer buy Gillette products and calling on society to let "boys be boys".I've used @Gillette razors my entire adult life but this absurd virtue-signalling PC guff may drive me away to a company less eager to fuel the current pathetic global assault on masculinity. Let boys be damn boys. Let men be damn men. https://t.co/Hm66OD5lA4— Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) January 14, 2019In truth, the message was 'be a better man'. Treat all people with respect and humility, be kind and care, even if it's just a little. I found the advert powerful, an emotional challenge to be a better man and a better role model for my son.Woolworths’s heteronormative Valentine’s DayThe second campaign was a bit closer to home, Woolworths's Valentine's Day campaign using old-fashioned references to male and female 'idiosyncrasies'. i know i spoke highly of woolworths like 3 minutes ago but whose ignorant as fuck idea was it to use 'love always wins' in their exceedingly heteronormative Valentine's day campaign? Why would you even....? Literally every song on earth is a love song? And u went with love wins?— Chelsea (@LoveChelsea16) February 4, 2019The popular retailer has not been far from controversy over the last few years – with product plagiarism claims – but I believe its Valentine's Day campaign was unfairly crucified on social media. It was criticised to such an extent that it had to pull the campaign to avoid further fallout.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/481043-120x120.jpg?1" alt="Woolworths pulls &amp;quot;gender stereotyping&amp;quot; Valentine's Day campaign" width="120" height="120">Woolworths pulls "gender stereotyping" Valentine's Day campaign#NEWSWATCH: Woolworths has pulled its in-store #LoveAlwaysWins Valentine's Day campaign following social media outrage, this just a few weeks after the retailer's Ubuntu Baba scandal...5 Feb 2019The problem is that brands have become too scared to push the boundaries. Creative partners are finding it increasingly difficult to sell ideas that challenge consumers, campaigns that make a stand, campaigns that are different, courageous, even brave. Great campaigns that challenge stereotypes, conformity, that are brave, that push us into a slightly uncomfortable place. Ads that are memorable, that stand out.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516444-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Joyce McCown on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">How to be brave, brandsWGSN's 2019 report on brands and marketing touched on everything from the power of collaboration to meaningful content and the importance of authenticity - it also highlighted the rise of 'brave brands'...By Lynette Botha 13 Sep 2019Will we see campaigns that achieve this moving forward? Perhaps a better question to ask in the interest of optimism is: will we see brands and marketing managers being brave enough to take a stand for ideas and creativity that will leave a positive legacy?
