Along the route, refreshment stations will celebrate the best music of the 80’s, 90’s and 00’s. In some of the routes the runners will be accompanied by music trucks to keep them motivated. According to OFM Marketing Manager, Lindiwe Mtwentula, this is the third year that OFM is presenting this wonderful event. “Last year, we had around 1,500 entries and we hope for even more this year! The Music Marathon celebrates music, running and a sense of community.  For serious runners this is a Comrades and Two Oceans qualifying event. And we have something special for our fun run participants as well!  The Best Dressed 5km runner will receive a prize and the theme is ‘Your Favourite Popstar’.” Official winners in the 42.2km, 21.1km and 10km categories will receive prize money and gold medals. All finishers within the given cut-off time will receive a medal. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519990-625x234.jpg" alt="Lace up for the Music Marathon with OFM" width="625" height="234">More information and entry forms are available at www.ofm.co.za or SMS “music” to 36636 at R1.50 per SMS for details.
