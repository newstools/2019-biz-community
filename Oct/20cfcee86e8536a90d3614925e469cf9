Ludus takes pride in being all about supporting its ‘work-family’, with the team spending so much time at the office that nurturing a family-culture is imperative.“One only needs to look at our social media to see that we are all about sharing this story with our clients, suppliers and friends. We are all about making our days memorable and exciting for both our clients and ‘The Fam’," says Ludus Client Liaison and Senior Producer Mandy Biart.In a perfectly diverse creative world“Historically, our industry hasn’t been a leader in diversity and inclusion,” says Biart. But, Ludus is committed to promoting South African women of colour to prominent positions to bring about real change. She continues: “It's important that our industry corrects the ratios and ensures women, and most importantly women of colour have a seat at the creative table.” Due to the gender bias gap, Ludus is committed to seeking out female talent for any new career opportunities that arise. All senior positions are held by women.Biart goes on to explain that the company take various steps in order to safeguard female employees against unwanted attention, as well as give them a voice in the organisation - A ‘velocity matters’ meeting is held once a week, which sets out the roadmap of what needs to be accomplished - on time and on budget. These are run by Ludus’ female managing director, Ashleigh Oates, and implemented by the all-women team of producers.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519465.jpg" alt="Celebrating Ludus women" width="625" height="463">Celebrating Ludus womenHow does Ludus live out its focus on people and talent above all else?‘The Fam’ (the Ludus team) is considered among the most valuable assets that the Ludus has. “They contribute to the mission and the company's overall success, which means it’s worth investing in them in order to motivate them to provide their best work,” comments Biart.According to Ludus philosophy, the key to developing ‘The Fam’ to the utmost of their potential is understanding their drives and what motivates them – getting to know what will reach and inspire them to push themselves further. “Placing greater responsibility on someone’s shoulders might seem like a burden for some, but for others it serves as a reward and motivation. It’s a show of faith on your part in their abilities, and a demonstration of your belief that they’re capable of handling more,” Biart concludes.Telling better creative storiesAs post-production partners for The Loeries 2019, Ludus also believes in pushing South African creatives to tell better, more diverse and authentic stories, encouraging industry players to work together to retain the value of their crafts and find new solutions which offer clients the best creative talent. Mark Ash, Senior Offline Editor, elaborates: "Our industry needs to pull together and unite as creatives rather than chip away at each other. Rather create synergy and greater capacity through collaboration with like-minded people, re-imagining the current way of working and rendering it far more inclusive. Doing so is the only way in which collective longevity can be ensured in an industry in flux."Since the Loerie Awards offer the most prestigious industry accolades on the continent, it is the ideal fit for Ludus, as the company’s corporate responsibility focus is to partner important events like this one. The Loeries post-production needs are diverse and road-mapped well in advance, months before the actual awards. As a facility, Ludus has the necessary capacity to roll out these requirements on time throughout the year.
