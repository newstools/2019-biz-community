Ms Dlamini’s statement to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, inferring that Sekunjalo owes monies to do with an August 2013 loan, is utter rubbish. To the contrary, Sekunjalo has invested into companies in which the PIC is a shareholder, and has in fact, loaned those companies money to assist in their operation and growth.  Ms Dlamini is well aware of the fact that the special purpose vehicle (SPV), Sekunjalo Independent Media (SIM), that was created with the purpose of securing Independent Media, is an entirely different juristic entity. Miss Dlamini has deliberately and willingly misinformed Parliament and we demand she retracts her statement and conveys the truth. In fact, the Sekunjalo Group is a creditor, like the PIC, when it comes to SIM. To suggest that there is any basis on which the PIC can liquidate Sekunjalo is deceitful, reckless and yet another example of how desperate the PIC and politically connected parties are to destroy and destabilise our business. Today’s comments and last week’s FSCA raid are not unrelated, they have been purposefully designed to cause maximum harm to Sekunjalo and myself but, we will not be intimidated.  We trust that Ms Dlamini will publicly correct her falsehood and do so within the next 24 hours, failing which, we will proceed with the appropriate action. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/521838.jpg" alt="Sekunjalo rejects that it owes the PIC any monies" width="333" height="79">
