This includes the approval of the Government of Tanzania.APRA is particularly excited at the prospect of returning to East Africa following the very successful hosting of this year's edition earlier on in Kigali, Rwanda. The fact that Tanzania has never hosted the conference; the remarkable strides made in recent years by PRST and the positively changing narrative of Tanzania, all serve as an irresistible pull for choosing Tanzania as the next destination. APRA, working with the Loth Makuza’s-led PRST promises to make APRA Tanzania 2020, a most exceptional conference befitting of an international forum that will make us all very proud. Over the next few weeks, a steady stream of information regarding the conference will be shared on our various platforms that will aid delegates in their travels, participation, accommodation and leisure experience, which APRA & PRST assure you will be most memorable and rewarding. The statement concluded: “APRA wishes to thank the Public Relations Association of Uganda (PRAU) and The Public Relations Institute of Southern Africa (PRISA) respectively, who in the spirit of ubuntu, true African brotherhood, so graciously offered to host the conference when the lacuna occurred. APRA intends to revisit their offers in the very near future. APRA urges its members and practitioners across and beyond Africa, to start planning actively to be part of APRA Tanzania 2020.
