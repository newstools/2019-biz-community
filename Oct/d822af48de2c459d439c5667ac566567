I wanted this one to feel warm and human. Vulnerable maybe. And a bit dumb.“I spoke to Harriet. We had a chat about the awards, the industry and what we do. I don't remember all that much about that talk other than bonding over a few of the themes that I guess we developed in the book. The neediness. The doubt and vulnerability associated not just with the awards but with working within the creative industries as a whole. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519452-625x417.jpg" alt="Image supplied." width="625" height="417">Image supplied.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519455-625x417.jpg" alt="Image supplied." width="625" height="417">Image supplied.“The craving for reassurance and validation all the time. The need for likes on your Instagram post. For views on your video. For a website to write about your work. And if none of those things happen...then what does that mean? Does what I do have value? Is what we do actually important? A lot of that bubbled around. That and the paradox of a lot of socially-minded left of centre creatives providing the (often rather successful) communications for multi-national corporations whose motives they are entirely at odds with. “I don't mean to imply all of that exists in the design of the book but – without sounding too pretentious – for me, the scrawl is trying to find an equivalence for that; the ghost in the corporate marketing machine.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/501479-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image from ." width="120" height="120">D&AD releases Regional Rankings and announces Network of the YearD&AD has released the final results for the 57th D&AD Awards which sees DDB Worldwide recognised as D&AD Network of the Year 2019...13 Jun 2019Every year, The D&AD Annual curates the best creative work across the design and advertising industry – showcasing all D&AD Pencil winners from that year’s awards. The 2019 Annual shines a light on work with real conviction that shifts culture and shapes global narratives. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519453-625x417.jpg" alt="Image supplied." width="625" height="417">Image supplied.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519457-625x417.jpg" alt="Image supplied." width="625" height="417">Image supplied.Devoy says: “Richard is an obvious choice for the cover. He’s a prodigiously talented designer, who comes armed with a phenomenal portfolio of challenging editorial covers for magazines and periodicals. He’s the guy that made Bloomberg Businessweek a must-read and revived MTV. The D&AD Annual feels like where his work belongs.”Reflecting on what she hopes creatives take away from the 2019 Annual, Devoy continued: “Take risks. It’s our job.”The Annual is available at www.dandad.org.
