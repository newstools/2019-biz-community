Luckily Manuel was in the house to share his personal carer journey on 9 October. If you were to check his Instagram profile, you’d instantly get a snapshot of his life – it’s filled with shoes, music, famous people and travel, but Manuel says that’s a bit of a misconception. While all those are big elements of his life, there’s a lot more to it than that.         View this post on Instagram           Today I ticked off a bucket list destination. A post shared by  Hayden Manuel (@hakesy_vet_ket) on Sep 25, 2019 at 10:22am PDT Manuel said when looking at any career, it’s not just about the end-goal but the process of getting there – most of us have to put in the time answering phones and making coffee to get there, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t trust the process.He shared his own story as proof of this – as his dad was one of ten kids, he grew up surrounded by healthy family competition, most in the sports sphere. From his mom’s side of the family, he learned about perseverance in business – his gran had dropped out of school at the age of 15 but rose through the ranks to become a buyer based at a fashion head office, often bringing home samples for the family.Varisty culture shockManuel added that he’d always loved hip-hop, art and fashion but he can’t sing, write or draw so he had to find another way to enter the industry. When he finished high school he wanted to study at the AAA School but they didn’t offer degrees at the time, which is what his parents insisted on, so he took on a more formal degree elsewhere.He’s lived a fairly sheltered existence up to then, so says he experienced a bit of a varsity culture shock as that’s the first time he made friends of other races.

From the blogs to the boardroom...He became the first non-athlete in South Africa to work with the brand, which was the start of a nine-year relationship. The best part of this was that he got to become part of the Nike Kids team, working with the likes of Riky Rick before the fame set in. Eventually he finished his degree through correspondence, and went on to complete his post-graduate studies through the AAA School, which really opened his mind to creativity. It was during this time that his ‘Bitches Must Know/They Know’ blog was started by a few girls in his class, as people always wanted to know where he got hold of his music and sneakers, so in 2011 it started as a way to spread knowledge, and blossomed into the biggest blog in the country, at one stage.This was because Manuel and friends documented their parties and uploaded their own content shot live at the events, not relying on press releases and reposting.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519692.jpg" alt="#StartupStory: Go green with Sneaker LAB" width="120" height="120">#StartupStory: Go green with Sneaker LABWith a global movement towards consciousness and sustainability becoming more apparent, more brands are looking to biotech as a solution...By Evan-Lee Courie 4 Oct 2019This grew to include radio and YouTube and proved so popular that a line of 100 t-shirts sold on the channel sold-out in just two hours. But that lifestyle’s hard to maintain.From the rockstar life to corporate thuggingExplaining his shift from the ‘rockstar life’ to one of ‘corporate thugging’, Manuel shared that he got tired of the lifestyle at the age of 26, which is when he met Rob Stokes, current chair of Red & Yellow School, and heard about the Quirk graduate programme.He thought the team was 'awesome' as they were playing beer-pong when he walked in at 11am, but his first six months as an intern were not fun as he had to face the typical millennial anxiety of phone calls – “If it’s not my boss, mom or sister calling, I don’t answer”- yet now he was expected to not just receive but also make calls on a landline.Looking back now, Manuel says the interning was the best thing that could have happened to him.

Manuel says that most career paths are long journeys, but as much as you need to move forward, Manuel says not to be afraid of taking detours.Explaining his current role, Manuel says he is creative director for the brand, which involves driving brand heat, supporting youth culture, identifying key moments, and landing key products in the market. This involves adapting the global strategy to South Africa without copy-pasting, and while showing sensitivity to the country’s current cultural tone.

A post shared by  PUMA South Africa (@pumasouthafrica) on Aug 18, 2019 at 12:00am PDT But as with most brands, Puma has evolved and is about more than just the product.How does it make customers feel at every touch point, and what’s their overall brand experience?Keeping this in mind means you need to constantly innovate and move forward, said Manuel.Tapping into youth cultureAll the events they hold result in content that celebrates the event while also creating Fomo so more people are inspired to attend the next event. The founders of Puma and Adidas are brothers, added Manuel, with healthy competition around the two.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/466754-120x120.jpg?1" alt="#NewBiz: Havas Media wins $300m Puma account" width="120" height="120">#NewBiz: Havas Media wins $300m Puma accountPuma has selected Havas Media to manage its global media buying and planning, effective as of the beginning of 2019...1 Nov 2018Explaining how Puma supports youth culture, Manuel said brands need to put their money where their mouth is, it’s about more than latching onto the current trending hashtags. Brands need to give back and empower the tribes they speak to.Athletes are the new rappers and vice versa, says Manuel. So when it comes to identifying key moment, this is the part of his role that takes up the most time, as you need to be tuned into what’s happening around you. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/504293-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Ben Moyo, a Zimbabwean-born photographer, Youtuber and creative director." width="120" height="120">#YouthMonth: Brands must have their finger on the pulse when it comes to youth cultureYoung creative Ben Moyo talks about collaborating with Adidas's NTWRK Area3 and shares why it is important for brands to support and collaborate with young creative talent and what they need to keep in mind when marketing to young people...By Juanita Pienaar 28 Jun 2019Relationships are key to getting this right and often the people you meet as an intern are the ones who respect your career growth and provide that all-important access.

This type of relationship goes beyond wearing the product – it’s meant to be a long-term relationship, which Nomzamo has proven as she’s already been with the team for four years.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1612/372589-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Every side is a good side for Mbatha..." width="120" height="120">#Behindtheselfie with...

You need to understand the temperature of the world you are speaking to.What do you bring to the table that nobody else has? You can’t go to school for experience. You need to add to the world, not just through creating pretty pictures. You’re not a creative if your work isn’t solving a problem.Don’t be afraid to work on something others see as ‘super boring’ – get in there and do it well. But then again, Manuel concluded that he didn’t need to tell the mainly Gen-Z audience this, as it’s the new way of living as we approach 2020.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490335-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image supplied." width="120" height="120">Puma to launch a sustainable sportswear collection with First MilePuma and First Mile will launch a sustainable sportswear collection by collecting plastic bottles to produce recycled polyester...2 Apr 2019Follow Puma South Africa, Hayden Manuel and Red & Yellow School on Instagram for the latest updates.
