This is the first step in finding the right solution for your business, brand or client.While the above are effective and accurate measurement techniques, they often prove complex and do not always translate well to a non-analytical mind. If you’ve attempted any of the above frameworks but have not gotten far then you should consider a different approach.<img src="https://biz-file.com/b/1709/63315.jpg?3" alt="Chris Moerdyk" width="120" height="120">Everything is measurable in marketingOne of the biggest myths in marketing is that advertising and public relations are not measurable.  Marketing managers, ad agency execs and media owners who tell that to their clients should be fired - plain and simple...By Chris Moerdyk, Issued by Chris Moerdyk 5 Jun 2008Step one: Understand that there are three segments of measurementOften these are split into various teams both internally and externally, and they require quite a bit of collaboration.The first is media (also known as vendor analytics), which is normally covered by your media partners, agency and marketing team. The second is channel (also known as platform analytics) – which is primarily covered by marketing managers or digital owners within the business, but there are benefits to the media partners and agencies having full sight of this. The last is business, which is primarily covered by the client and business analytics teams.These segments are often referred to as the source of truth, with each team viewing this from a different perspective.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/522880-625x215.jpg" alt="A different perspective on measurement for the non-analytical mind" width="625" height="215">Step two: Build a top-level measurement view and assign a ‘hero’Once you’ve defined who is responsible for these three segments, your next step is to drive collaboration in the ecosystem; this could be through the use of tools such as Google Data Studio or Tableau, or even a project manager with technical and analytical skills.This project manager will need to work closely with partners, agencies, and the client. The grand job here is to assist in creating a single source of truth, with transparency across these segments of measurement.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/476443-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Marketing research - Fact or fiction?" width="120" height="120">Marketing research - Fact or fiction?It's an important question since many marketing decisions are made on the results of marketing research.

Using a tool like Funnelytics or designing something on PowerPoint should make this a little easier for the visualisation of the segments.In addition, including how these segments and ecosystems work with one another can give you further clarity on how measurement ties into everything.Here’s an example:<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/522881-625x211.jpg" alt="A different perspective on measurement for the non-analytical mind" width="625" height="211">Step three: Create your single source of truthAs mentioned above, an easy way to create your single source of truth is by using a data aggregator such as Google Data Studio or Tableau. These tools pull in all performance data and aggregate the results in a single place; even better if you have the transparency to pull in CRM data.Thanks go to Maurice Wilkes, David Wheeler and Stanley Gill who paved the road for the APIs we use today. These incredible plugins pull data into your chosen aggregators to tell a story of success or failure, and highlight where the possible gaps in your system are.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/485319.jpg" alt="What are the key social engagement metrics your company should focus on in 2019" width="120" height="120">What are the key social engagement metrics your company should focus on in 2019Social media is based on a conversation.
