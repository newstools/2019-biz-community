We need to stand out, but rooting our actions in it carries a potential danger. This danger is obsession: an obsession to do anything in our power to stand out, be it online, in our PR efforts, our product launches, our slogans – you name it.This is also often the result of a fast-paced and highly-reactive world in which we respond, rather than think purposefully before we respond. An obsession can make us forget our purpose and true function, and lead us into the trap of over-promising (or even making false promises) and under-delivering.Today’s consumers seek value – authentic value – and the obsession with differentiation might make us lose sight of this core need and of our role in providing and communicating authentic value.We need to move from differentiation to authenticity.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516700-120x120.jpg" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty." width="120" height="120">The significant shift from aspirational to inspirational brandsThe Top Million research report into South Africa's top million households in 2019 - with a combined buying power of R700 billion - looks at what drives this 'Upper Middle Class'; what they are spending on; where they have cut back; and how marketers can reach this group...?By Louise Marsland 13 Sep 2019Identify the authenticity cuesThe literature on authenticity suggests that consumers use two sets of cues to authenticate a product, service or concept. These are indexical and iconic cues.Indexical cues are associated with facts. The consumer will search for facts to authenticate a company, service or product. This can be online, researching reviews or even talking to other people to gain information.Iconic cues, on the other hand, are more ‘fluffy’. They are the sum total of pre-existing knowledge or experiences – which is then used to analyse, compare and authenticate. This could have interesting implications, especially for businesses that fall into the ‘grudge purchases’ category.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517145-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Toa Heftiba on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Consumers want to see brands' humanity - finds Brands in Motion 2019 global studyAccording to WE Communications' Brands in Motion 2019 global study, 90% of South Africa respondents believe that brands could play an even greater role in providing stability...18 Sep 2019A lot of these previously held perceptions are deep-rooted and are used with such automatic ease in order to authenticate that they pose a real challenge for those industries that have a deep-rooted perception associated with them.Nevertheless, the important thing is to recognise these cues, know-how consumers apply them, and then strategise around them to move towards authenticity. Gaining a deeper understanding of the consumer is a vital step towards identifying not just the cues, but the predominant cues – and the processes and perceptions that are at work to develop the final picture of genuineness and realness.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517662-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Mpumelelo Macu on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Tastefully celebrating holidays and events: how brands can get it rightWith Heritage Day on the horizon, consumers can expect to see two things in brands' social media and content around 24 September...By Marc de la Querra 20 Sep 2019How do we create a deeper understanding?

To apply this, formulate questions to understand which sources your consumers use as indexical cues, and – this is important – probe and delve as deeply as possible into your questioning to identify and understand the more challenging iconic cues.Here you need to uncover how previous experiences have shaped perceptions, and how potential pre-existing knowledge has been at play so that you can identify and direct the route to regaining trust, if necessary, and educate people about your company or brand.But it’s important that these insights are not used to fool people. If you want the connection, you need to be genuine; and being genuine comes from understanding our purpose.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519573-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Mo Flava up on stage at Heavy Chef and Discovery Business Insurance's Inspire Sessions event. ©" width="120" height="120">The Inspire Sessions: How to attain influence, wield it and use it to grow your businessThis Discovery Business Insurance and Heavy Chef's 'Inspire' Sessions event centred around influence - how to attain it, how to wield it and how to grow your business through using influencer marketing...By Juanita Pienaar 4 Oct 2019Have a purposeThis I learned from Joe Public’s admirable leader, Pepe Marais, who also spoke at the #UJMarketingFit Experience. Before the vision and the mission statement, there needs to be a purpose.Why are you in business? What do you strive for, and what do you truly wish to be and achieve? This core purpose should be a constant reminder to your business and guide your product development, services, and communication – and it should come from a deeply rooted place, not only to reflect your genuineness to your consumer and, through that but also achieve trust.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519832.jpg" alt="Authentic storytelling to attract a new generation of tourist" width="120" height="120">Authentic storytelling to attract a new generation of touristA powerful message emerged during trends presentations at the recent Wine & Food Tourism Conference: a unified view that authenticity is essential in not only reaching, but converting new-generation customers and making them loyalists...Issued by August Collective 4 Oct 2019Don’t be blinded by the differentiation obsession: it could lead to empty promises and the under-delivery of value – and cost you your customers. Don’t react for the sake of responding: be guided by your purpose. The true purpose of your business – always stay reminded of it.Gain market insight to understand what authenticity cues your market seeks out, and use these inputs to drive the provision of authentic value not only in your products or services but also in your communication.Be genuine, be real, build trust. Trust will contribute to a deeper connection and greater longevity in your relationship with your customers.
