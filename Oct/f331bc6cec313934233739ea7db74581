This TV commercial links its inspiration to the passionate support of the Springboks that South Africa has, while tapping into the intensity of the sport. In some of their films, Schuster and Ntombela, have for years supported the Springboks from songs to cameo appearances of the team’s gear in some productions. It is also evidenced by the now-popular, "Hie' Kommie Bokke", which can be seen as a war cry that is synonymous with the pair.At the time of airing this ad, the country is gripped by Rugby World Cup fever and the Springboks are punted as one of the favourites to be crowned champions. The commercial’s nostalgic approach with South African favourites; a braai, snacks and beer on rugby day, plays well into the country’s love of sport and a good old laugh.The World Sports Betting ad reminds South Africans to place their bets.Agency and team creditsAd title: World Sports Betting Rugby World Cup 2019Country: South AfricaClient: World Sports BettingCreative agency: Press Play Films SA acted as agency and production company on this projectAccount director: Tina DearloveExecutive creative director: Nick DearloveCopywriter: Lewis Lehman (scriptwriter)Production company: Press Play Films SARecording studio: Produce SoundExecutive producer: Tina DearloveMusic and sound design: Joe DarlingAgency producer: Tina DearloveDirector: Nick DearloveDirector of photography: Chuanne BlofieldProduction art director: Black MaverickEditor: Jordan KoenPost production: Mushroom MediaStills photographer: Nick LourensIf you are an advertising, creative or digital agency – or a brand – in Africa with work that’s on TV, please tweet us on @OrnicoMedia and add #AfricanAdShowcase.
