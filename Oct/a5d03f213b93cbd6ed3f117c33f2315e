This year's recipient, Marc Wainer, founder of Redefine Properties, was awarded for his dedication and leadership. Wainer founded Redefine in 1999 and listed it in 2000 with a market capitalisation of R463m.While accepting his award, Wainer encouraged the industry to embrace change and nurture young professionals and business owners."We need a different approach to how we've been doing things over the years. Our tenants and retailers are facing huge costs, not just in terms of rental, but operating costs like electricity. We need to nurture and bring in a lot more young people. I can tell you from my mentorship challenge that there are many that would make great tenants in a shopping centre if we just gave them a chance. We have to do this if we want a better country and if we want more profitable investments in our sectors," Wainer said.Wainer dedicated the award to his wife, who passed away recently.SACSC Young Achiever Award: Antoinette JoubertThis award acknowledges the under 40's in the industry whom in a short period of time have achieved much in their career.

"They took me out of stockbroking and brought me into the property industry. I wouldn't be here without them," she said.Joubert is also the SACSC Congress chairman.
