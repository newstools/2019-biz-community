Unmet expectations lead to disappointment among critical stakeholders and lead to a worse reputation than what the company had before the public relations campaign. Marketing or PR campaigns will never work to create a sustainably better reputation just by themselves. The marketing campaign initially leads to higher sales, more awareness or improved perceptions, but these successes are typically not sustained beyond the life span of the campaign. A case in point is Wells Fargo. An American bank whose employees registered thousands of false bank accounts in order to claim commission. An internal toxic culture facilitated such unethical transactions. In an attempt to regain trust, the bank embarked on an expensive advertising campaign which never worked, as the root cause of the breakdown in trust had not been addressed. The feel-good factor and emotional bond to the brand that good reputations endow was short-lived, and costly. An example of what works sustainably is to alert potential customers to a product feature that they had not known before. The same is true for efforts to improve corporate reputation. Alerting the public to a strength of the company it had not known, will lead to a sustainably better reputation. The two fundamental questions therefore should be: Are there positive aspects to your organisations that matter to your stakeholders that they are unaware of? How can we make sure we get better at what matters most to our stakeholders, and then share our success?The answer to the first question requires, on the one hand, a deep understanding of the company and its capabilities, and on the other hand, a deep understanding of the priorities of the stakeholders. Typically, this insight is gained through research, which unearths such areas of capabilities that are not yet appreciated by stakeholders.The second challenge is to develop the organisation and its innovative capabilities where it matters to stakeholders. This is a challenge for top management. The need to communicate the success in building such capabilities only falls on communications and PR agencies once the capability is actually operational.In the long run, reputations are a pretty good reflection of what is really going on. Efforts to pretend something the organisation is not, more often than not, ends in tears. Putting lipstick on the bulldog puts the company at risk. This is however what most communications departments and most PR firms do. In fairness though, these agencies are usually not empowered to do anything else but create perceptions with their campaigns. So what chance of success do they have in the long run?Building a self-sustaining good reputation can only be done from the inside-out. To put the responsibility to achieve this in the hands of the communications function alone is an abdication of responsibility of the board and the c-suite. The more important question at the top of the organisation should be: How do we first become the organisation that we want to be famous for?Dr Dominik Heil is with Wits Business School and a Partner in Hewers Reputation Analytics.
