Chef Gordon is well travelled and gained experience while working in Scotland, Switzerland, Cyprus and in the five-star Savoy Hotel in London, England. When asked about 2019 conference food trends, he explains that delegates are preferring a fun selection of items to the more traditional buffet lunch options. Popular food items include items with Mexican flair such as enchiladas and tacos, gourmet diner-style items such as burgers and hotdogs as well as a selection of Deli rolls. Gordon also goes on to mention that there is a definite shift towards convenient and healthy food options. He mentions that harvest tables have become a very popular choice on conferences as it adds interest to the event and has a wide appeal. At Gallagher, our team of chefs are constantly developing new ideas and food combinations.
