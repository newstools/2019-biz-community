You might have had trouble Tweeting, getting notifications, or viewing DMs. We're currently working on a fix, and should be back to normal soon.— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) October 2, 2019When we noticed the update just after 8am on Wednesday morning, Tweetdeck was largely functional. The only issue we can spy at present is the inability to load location trends.It’s not completely clear what the problem is, but Twitter is “working on a fix”.The downtime comes just after the company rolled out DM searching to iOS users, but we doubt the two are correlated.
