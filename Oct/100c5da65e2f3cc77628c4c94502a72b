What if we told you that your competition database is a gold mine to inform your marketing and customer experience strategy? It is also the key enabler for research.  Let us show you how we do itData is where it all begins... and knowing what to do with it is our differentiator. Below are a few of the insights we can provide you with as a starting point with just a cell number. We will first match your competition database (provided it's opt-in) against the ID Number. Next step is to match it against various data slices to understand the following (see below image): Demographics (Gender; age; population group) Job Titles (Career defines a person eclectic skills, personality type and informs strategy and advertising) Top names and surnames (Informs storytelling and content resonance for ATL, TTL, and BTL Advertising) Business Owners (This can provoke many hypotheses for further interpretation and also help to further scale your business and build meaningful customer experiences) Income Bracket (Affordability and priority, emerging and prominent segment based on real data) Home Owner and renters  (Where they reside) This informs distribution, content, advertising, and POS Strategy, especially if you are working with a limited budget Marital Status ( This can provoke many hypotheses for further interpretation) Are they using apps? If your business wants to migrate users to an app, it's important to understand who has smartphones. More importantly, you would need to know who are active app users.  This way you can identify customers who are not using your app and have the propensity to download your app. Prominent clusters per region: This is GOLD for your TTL and BTL strategies.  Also essential to building premium customer experiences as a starting point for CX Audits.Data Slices Example for Data Enriched Persona Mapping<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/523145-625x381.png" alt="How to leverage your competition entries with data science" width="625" height="381">Next Step: Analyse: We analyse your data and provide you with an interactive dashboard to access for 12 months (It's amazing!)
