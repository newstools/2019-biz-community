While we celebrate their courage, we lament that it is required," said Joel Simon, CPJ's executive director. "The sad reality is that around the world independent journalism is threatened by populist authoritarians who disdain and disparage the work of the independent press. This is true in the countries represented by our honorees and many others."CPJ's 2019 Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award recognising extraordinary and sustained achievement in the cause of press freedom will be presented to Zaffar Abbas, editor of Pakistan's daily newspaper Dawn. Abbas, who has decades of experience as a reporter in Pakistan, has led Dawn since 2010. Under his leadership, Dawn and its reporters frequently have come under government pressure."Zaffar Abbas is the embodiment of journalistic courage, which is why the board is so pleased to honor him with the Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award," said Kathleen Carroll, chair of the CPJ board. "Every day he fights to deliver facts to Dawn's readers in the face of pressure, obstacles, and blockades from the institutions in Pakistan that would much prefer to go about their business without scrutiny from the press or the public."All of the winners will be honored at CPJ's annual awards and benefit dinner. This year's dinner will be chaired by Laurene Powell Jobs and Peter Lattman of the Emerson Collective. The videos for the awards will be produced by VICE Media.The event will be held at the Grand Hyatt New York in New York City on November 21, 2019.
