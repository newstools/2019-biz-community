The creative agency comes up with a great concept, but can the production company produce it within budget and on time?The media agency books the spots for the creative, but are they looking at previous campaign results to base their channel, day and day-part selection on? Using one agency to handle all these aspects will result in an integrated campaign where performance is top of mind throughout the entire process.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/512126-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Joshua Earle on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Digital advertising is changing and so should our tacticsOne of the things that digital marketers have in common is growth hacking (not the startup kind, the growth kind)...By Yvette Gengan 19 Aug 2019Data augmented creation as part of the performance approachWhen data is at the core of every step in the creation and production process, you know that all elements – concept, script, actors, etc. – are crafted and chosen based on real data. Here’s a five-step approach to developing performance-driven creative:Step one The first step in the creation process is to evaluate data. By analysing the client’s target group, competitors as well as drivers and barriers to purchase, we have access to real insights that are used in the creative brief.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/514079-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Luke Chesser on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">3 data trends shaping digital marketing in the next 18 monthsDatacore Media MD Grant Lapping outlines three data-related trends that will change the game for brands over the next year to 18 months...By Grant Lapping 30 Aug 2019Step twoMeasuring the performance of previous campaigns is also a crucial part of the process. And by performance, I’m not referring to how many people were reached at which frequency, I mean how did the campaign perform in relation to business KPIs – visits to the website, app downloads, conversions, etc. By using two data sets – the client’s TV schedule and website traffic data – TV attribution software can measure how individual spots and media placement affects ROI. This information is very valuable in the C&P process to ensure that every campaign performs better than previous ones.Step threeUsing data from consumer psychology, learnings from attribution software and target group preferences, an AI booster can be used to develop an objective message for the creative based on language and target group. If the target for the creative is, for instance, a male person living in South Africa, the AI booster will replace words or phrases that won’t resonate with the target. Every step brings you closer to developing creative with a strong performance foundation.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515494.jpg" alt="Humans, AI and the constant march of progress" width="120" height="120">Humans, AI and the constant march of progressThese days we don't have to wait long for reality to catch up with human imagination - advanced technologies and AI have helped human evolution to step up the pace considerably...Issued by Ads24 6 Sep 2019Step fourWould you buy a new car based on gut feeling only?

Looking at past success, a 20-second ad (with a 10-second cut down version) performs much better than a 30-second or 60-second ad.For digital brands, the call to action at the end of the ad is a crucial element for performance. This call-to-action will be linked to the business KPIs (website visits, app downloads, etc.).Using a performance approach when doing the media planning is just as important.
