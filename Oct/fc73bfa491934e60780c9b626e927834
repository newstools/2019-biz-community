This award was named after the late Roger Garlick who died tragically at the pinnacle of his media career. He embraced the notions of media innovation and creative media strategy and was recognised for his revolutionary efforts in this field.Donald Mokgale, managing director of Carat JHB and an Amasa judge, supports Roger’s vision stating: “In an economy that is under duress, businesses are looking for solutions that will help them survive the tough times. Media, historically, has always been one of those tools that can do that, if done correctly. Ergo, media campaigns whose creativity drives business results and returns are crucial during these trying times. So a very critical criteria is business results.”Take a look at all the finalists:EntryAdvertiserEntrantBest Branded Content Campaign#BETHEGENERATIONHPThe Catalyst AfricaSay it with P.SMondelezStarcomSolutionist ThinkingRMBPrimedia BroadcastingThink Wallet, Act WiseStandard BankOMDBest Contribution by a Media Owner (Only media owners to enter)Continental Tyres Free ClimberContinental TyresAdColonyFind the Mango SeatSAA, MangoMediaMarkMake a Meal of itUCOOKMediamarkSkhumba RugbyFNBMediamarkBest Experiential / Event Campaign#BETHEGENERATIONHPThe Catalyst Africa#SeeYouThroughCoca-ColaPlaymakersBig BucketKFCPlaymakersGlobal Ctizen Festival : Mandela 100Global CitizenOnPoint PRKFC Mini-Cricket kids join the ProteasKFCPlaymakersShare a Coke with MeCoca-ColaMediaCom South AfricaWimpy KidsWimpyThe MediaShopBest Integrated Campaign: B2BTake a closer lookSysproDemographicaBest Integrated Campaign: Financial#BLACKFRIDAYMEFNBBRANDTRUTH//DGTLAfricanacityABSACaratIndiefin MulletsIndieFinVizeumGrass Roots for GreatnessFNBMediamarkStandard Bank Proteas at the World CupStandard BankOMDBest Integrated Campaign: FMCG"Most people eating breakfast in bed" Guinness World RecordCappyMediaCom South AfricaBig BucketKFCPlaymakers Sports MarketingCadbury Dairymilk GenerosityMondelezStarcomDove Show UsUnileverPHD Media South AfricaFree to LoveUnileverOnPoint PROld Spice, Inja Ye GameOld SpiceMediaCom South AfricaOMFCCMondelezStarcomShare a Coke with MeCoca-ColaMediaCom South AfricaBest Integrated Campaign: Media, Entertainment & LeisureFind the Mango SeatSAA, MangoMediamarkLiam Neeson Mobile SOSEmpire EntertainmentPHD Media South AfricaSearch for the face of Ponds 2019UnileverMedia Heads 360Best Integrated Campaign: Rest Of AfricaCoke & MealCoca-ColaMediaCom South AfricaCoke StudioCoca-ColaMediaCom South AfricaCOPACoca-ColaMediaCom South AfricaBest Integrated Campaign: Retail (Incl. eCommerce and QSR)Bring it HomeWoolworthsQMedia GroupMake a Meal of ItUCOOKMediaMarkRemote ConvenienceDebonairs PizzaThe MediaShopShoprite HustleShopriteThe MediaShopBest Integrated Campaign: Travel & TourismEmirates Persuit of JazzEmiratesHavas Media South AfricaFind the Mango SeatSAA, MangoMediaMarkBest Online Campaign#BLACKFRIDAYMEFNBBrandTruth MarketingCadbury P.S Valentines DayCadburyStarcomFree Trial SubscriptionStandard Bank CIBOMDIndiefin MulletsIndieFin, SanlamVizeumBest Social Media#BlackFridayMeFNBBrandTruth MarketingBring it HomeWoolworthsQmedia GroupOld Spice, Inja Ya GameOld SpiceMediaCom South AfricaShare a Coke with MeCoca-colaMediaCom South AfricaBest Sponsorship#SeeYouThroughCoca-ColaPlaymakers Sports MarketingBig BucketKFCPlaymakers Sports MarketingL'Oreal How do I LookL'OrealThe MediaShopMini-Cricket Kids join the ProteasKFCPlaymakers Sports MarketingBest Trade MarketingGumtree Mythbusters RoadshowGumtreeMeta MediaROOTS 2019ROOTSSPARK MediaBest Use of a Small BudgetDarren Prank - KFMCapitecMeta MediaFood for thoughtFishawaysThe MediaShopShowcaseCapitecMeta MediaBest Use of MobileKwid: BreakthroughRenaultAdColonySnapchat WatersavingColgateWavemakerWhen you drive, never drinkHeinekenDentsu RedstarBest Use of Out Of HomeBeaded BillboardToyotaMeta MediaMost people eating beakfast in bed - GWRCappyGroup MProtea FireMultichoice South AfricaThe MediaShopRadio to RoadPrimedia OOHPrimedia OutdoorShadowNetflixGroupMTaste the SunSol, HeinekenDentsu RedstarBest Use of RadioFinancial EducationCapitecMeta MediaLet's be HonestCoronation Fund ManagersVizeumNando's Manifesto News DistributionNando'sThe MediaShopShare a Coke ith MeCoca-ColaMediaCom South AfricaThe Media Play LoungeCell CMeta MediaBest Use of Technology / DataB Class Dynamic Creative EndineMercedes BenzMMS CommunicationChristopher : DStv Super RugbyDStvChristopher AfricaFreeMe "Summer Numbers Campaign"TelkomAdColonyJanuworryCapitecPHD Media South AfricaSteers Ribster_Build a BurgerSteersAdColonyUEFA Champion's League - Legend Reveal Dentsu RedstarBest Use of TelevisionDirty JobsSweet-OrrQMedia GroupRemote ConvenienceDebonairs PizzaThe MediaShopThe Audi TV HackAudiPHD Media South AfricaTimeless Bold TasteAmstelDentsu RedstarIgnition Award for Students#KuphelaAzaniaCoca-Cola, Iron BrewUniversity of Johannesburg#LifeSnackBakersUniversity of JohannesburgKeep their tails waggingBeenoUniversity of JohannesburgThe Ultimate PlanFujifilmUniversity of JohannesburgThe winners will be announced at the award ceremony, which will be held at The Houghton Hotel in Johannesburg on 24 October 2019.
