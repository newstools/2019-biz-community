Our digital world has its benefits, it helps us to learn, explore and connect true inspiration comes from beyond the desktop.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513862-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Amy Shamblen on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">What do we do outside of work and how does it enable us to do great work?The vast majority of us have careers where fulfilling our passions every day at the workplace is not as plausible as philosophers or motivational speakers would have you believe...By Marisa Louw 28 Aug 2019Stop and smell the roses Moments of inspiration happen at the most unlikely of times – when you least expect it. A visit to a gallery, watching a bee collect pollen from a flower, your four-year-old’s artistic impression of you: moments when you absorb the world.And they all more than likely happen when you’re not sat at your desk, staring into your screen hoping inspiration will strike.At the recent Exporters Awards at the Boardwalk International Convention Centre in Port Elizabeth, my team and I were tasked with designing the set and bringing their theme to life. I drive past the city’s port daily, and it was the shapes the cranes made, the clanging of containers and the industrial nature of the economic hub of the city that inspired the set design.My team and I did away with the corporate white set, the typical two screens and a stage; and embraced scaffolding and creatively enhanced the design though decorative panels and static and roving lighting to create a mood of celebration and exclusivity.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/520059.jpg" alt="Creative and unusual event ideas to help you stand out" width="120" height="120">Creative and unusual event ideas to help you stand outIt's hard being an event planner! You've got to deal with a jaded crowd who's seen and done it all so you've got to overcome their sense of ennui - while still pleasing your boss and sponsors and coming in under budget...Issued by The Canvas Riversands 7 Oct 2019Leadership expert, Robin Sharma, is an advocate of nature walks to break free of the chains of “normal thinking”, and going deep into the loftiest realms of creativity, introspection and uncommon insight.And don’t take his word for it, science backs up the benefits of solitude and time away from the desk. When you get out “into the wild”, your brain waves slow down from beta to alpha. And when you do this in solitude, the part of your brain responsible for self-criticism, mental chatter and constant worry shuts down.A flow state of mind This silencing of the prefrontal cortex happens temporarily and is known as transient hypofrontality. With the prefrontal cortex temporarily quieten, you enter the flow state. When you’re in flow, your neurochemistry is altered.Dopamine (the neurochemical of inspiration) gets released, along with anandamide (the neurochemical of bliss) and serotonin (the neurochemical of pleasure). When you’re in this place, you get your best ideas.Your creativity makes explosive gains. You begin to see around corners and over hurdles and can solve problems you might not ordinarily be able to solve.My point is, it’s a wonderful world that we live and work in and, sometimes, it’s good to take the blinkers off and take a look around.And for us creatives, do we get enough time to take part in wide-open thinking at the start of projects? To go out ‘into the field’ to get involved in immersive research that happens in any discovery phase of a project.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511402-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: AJ on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Spring beamSeptember is the month of bright flowers, fresh scents and new beginnings and the chance to smile, writes Howard Feldman...By Howard Feldman 14 Aug 2019The answer is yes, we should. But I think it’s also our job as teams to simply take the time to step back. Chat more. Visit that gallery or just go for that walk.The inspiration is out there. Somewhere. You just need to tap into your mind.
