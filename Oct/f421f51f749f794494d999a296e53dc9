Big September with LottoStar has become a landmark month in the Western Cape and has captured the hearts and mind of our listeners. Every day throughout the month of September entrants stood a chance to win up to R250,000 four times a day, every single day across the station. At the end of the campaign we gave one lucky listener a life-changing amount of money: ONE MILLION RAND IN CASH. The total winnings during Big September together with the money raised for charity amounted to over R2.4m - the biggest cash giveaway in the history of Cape Town radio,” said Kfm 94.5 Station Manager, Stephen Werner. “We can’t think of better way for the people of the Cape to have the biggest September than by giving away the biggest cash prize during one single radio show. Not only have we made listeners smile but we have also raised more than half a million rand to aid the fight against femicide in South Africa. Thank you, Cape Town, thank you Kfm 94.5 listeners, see you in 2020 for an even bigger BIG September with LottoStar and Kfm 94.5,” commented LottoStar Director, Tasoulla Hadjigeorgiou .
