That's why Emert began his presentation with a reminder that we are living in a feedback economy, which means true business success can no longer be measured on just a transactional basis, as it also involves attitudinal factors.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/467928-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The hidden customer engagement tool lying dormant at every retailer" width="120" height="120">The hidden customer engagement tool lying dormant at every retailerWith two prime shopping periods ahead - Black Friday and the Festive Season shopping extravaganza - retailers are preparing for a bumper sales season to mitigate the slow retail sales growth experienced during much of the year...By Daniel Logan 8 Nov 2018But how do you close the gap between the customer expectation, based on the promise your brand has made, and reality of the experience they receive? Unpacking the customer experience gapEmert says the customer experience gap is a combination of the following:A study by American Express shows that it’s a marketing gap, with 33% of customers leaving a brand after just one bad experience;SAP customer data shows it’s also a digital gap, as 94% of mobile web visitors that add to the cart don’t complete the purchase;CSO Insights reports that there’s a sales gap, as average sales turnover is 25%; andAccording to Temkin Group Research, there’s also a service gap, as resolving customer service issues are seen as the most impactful customer journey moments in 16 out of 19 industries surveyed.In addition, 90% of CEOs believe they are delivering a superior experience, while just 19% of customers agree.Emert says we need to close the gap to connect the journey – the below video explains the context well:It’s essentially about acknowledging that customer journeys are unique, fragmented and non-linear, and that each customer journey should be about collecting data for the full buyer’s circle, from every single point of interaction the customer has with the brand – both as operational and experience data.Meet X and O – experience and operational dataEmert then shared examples of operational (O) and experience (X) data, stating that operational data is the hard data of what’s actually happening. It’s the real sales numbers on the financials, as well as other hard-and-true figures like your win rate, inventory turnover, share of wallet, profitability, cart abandonment, and core resolution data. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1710/416181.png" alt="Seven ways to embed your EFM programme to drive sales" width="120" height="120">Seven ways to embed your EFM programme to drive salesToday's C-suite executives are familiar with customer feedback in ways that colleagues in previous eras could only dream of...Issued by Ipsos 26 Oct 2017On the other hand is experience data, which is why it’s happening, and essentially what’s driving that customer sentiment. This includes such ‘former intangibles’ as customer satisfaction, purchase intent, likelihood to churn, customer effort score, Net Promoter Score (NPS) and customer lifetime value.Emert says that taking the combination of what’s happening and why it’s happening is important to get a single-view of the customer. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/523881.jpg" alt="#ExperienceAdvantage: Closing the experience gap in the feedback economy" width="625" height="329">All too many times, the place we get this wrong is deciding how to close the loop, especially if customers are sharing that the experience was not a good one? What do you do with that information? Closing the experience gapEmert says the key here is being able to ingest that information back into your operational system.Often, this means send out surveys asking customers for their feedback and to rate the experience, then parse that information back into the CRM. That way, sales reps are better prepared, prior to their next engagement with the customer. It was seem obvious, but Emert says it’s a step many brands miss.For service, we create tickets to escalate and deal with problems timeously, but these should also be logged in the CRM for a complete transactional history. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1801/426192.jpg" alt="Kantar TNS and Qualtrics join forces to form global customer experience powerhouse" width="120" height="120">Kantar TNS and Qualtrics join forces to form global customer experience powerhouseResearch agency Kantar TNS and Qualtrics, a leader in experience management, have announced a global partnership to help organisations put customers at the heart of their business...Issued by Kantar 22 Jan 2018It’s about collecting the experience data and combining it with the operational data, then bringing it back into the system of record to really close the loop and offer a complete snapshot of your performance.Watch the below case study to find out how Porsche put this in action:Emert concluded with tips to become a leader in the experience economy:Experience economy leadership tipsIt all boils down to delivering on the moments that matter most to your customers.
