The predicted full-year growth figure for 2019 is an upgrade of 0.4 percentage points on the figure forecast at the last release of adspend data in July this year.Overall market growth is being driven by increased spend on online advertising, which saw rises across most formats. Digital ad formats for radio broadcasters witnessed a year-on-year rise of 15.9% and online national newsbrands recorded growth of 15.6% over the same period. Digital out of home – not included in online totals – experienced growth of 17.2%. The report reveals particularly strong growth in Q2 2019 compared to Q2 2018 in TV video on demand (VOD) and cinema. TV VOD saw an increase of 20% in Q2 2019, while cinema recorded a very impressive rise of 49.6%. The sector benefited from the entry of several new advertisers in comparison to the same period in 2018, boosting growth substantially. SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519173-120x120.jpg?2" alt="TV leads ad investment for food and soft drinks while the rest shifts online - finds Warc" width="120" height="120">TV leads ad investment for food and soft drinks while the rest shifts online - finds WarcAccording to Warc, television still has a stronghold on advertising investment for soft drinks and food...2 Oct 2019"These very encouraging adspend figures for Q2 2019 cover the period immediately following the original Brexit date of 29 March, demonstrating the continued strength of UK advertising during a time of political uncertainty. Advertising's dynamism is shown by the growth recorded across many different formats, with particularly impressive performances from cinema, TV VOD and online radio,” says Stephen Woodford, chief executive at the Advertising Association. "These figures are positive for our industry and are good indicators of the resilience of the UK economy. However, with another scheduled Brexit departure date looking likely to be passed on 31 October, we are acutely conscious of the industry's desire for the clarity needed to continue investing for the future during these uncertain times."SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/505432-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Internet advertising set to account for more than 50% of global adspend by 2021" width="120" height="120">Internet advertising set to account for more than 50% of global adspend by 2021Internet advertising is set to exceed half of global adspend by 2021, although, as the internet ad market matures, growth is projected to slow from 17% to 9% a year...8 Jul 2019"An upgrade to our 2019 projection of almost half a point is reflective of stellar online growth, as well as over-performance for several traditional channels against the expectations we laid out in July. There is little in the data we receive from media owners across the industry to suggest an impending downturn, but growth cannot be taken for granted while economic prosperity remains in the balance," adds James McDonald, managing editor at Warc.Full-year forecast summary 2018-2020Adspend 2018 (£m)2018 v 2017 (% change)Forecast 2019 (Year-on-year % changeForecast 2020 (Year-on-year% change)Search6,65614.30%11.60%10.30%Online display*5,33221.40%13.10%10.10%TV5,1110.10%-0.90%2.50%of which VOD39129.40%18.70%15.00%Direct mail1,552-8.70%-9.50%-5.40%Online classified*1,451-1.30%1.30%1.80%Out of home1,2095.70%6.90%3.70%of which digital60314.70%13.40%11.70%National newsbrands968-7.10%-3.50%-3.60%of which online274-2.60%5.00%5.40%Regional newsbrands804-9.30%-9.30%-4.60%of which online2287.60%5.40%7.00%Magazine brands718-7.50%-7.60%-5.00%of which online270-0.30%-1.40%0.30%Radio7145.10%2.70%4.80%of which online4530.60%20.40%21.20%Cinema254-2.10%16.40%-3.20%TOTAL UK ADSPEND23,5616.20%5.00%5.30%*Broadcaster VoD, digital revenues for newsbrands, magazine brands, and radio station websites are also included within online display and classified totals, so care should be taken to avoid double counting.
