The theme of the conference is Marketing Works. Work it. “But it’s not all doom and gloom” he continues, “with purposeful creativity, brands can still be relevant and valued." Patrick has been Creative Director of Ogilvy EMEA, Creative Director of EHS Brann Europe and, most recently, led Google’s creative think-tank, The Zoo.  Patrick believes there are seven specific actions marketers can take to ensure that their brands not only survive, but thrive. Not least of which are being mobile, insightful and agile. “In addition, brands need to be social, collaborative and innovative too. And, of course, being purposeful always tops the list,” he says. As the second international speaker of the day – the first being, Keynote speaker Fernando Machado, Global CMO for Burger King - Patrick will be elaborating on these actions in his presentation. He will also be facilitating a workshop the day after the conference for African members of thenetworkone – the world’s largest network of independent advertising agencies. “We are delighted to have two such internationally renowned speakers in our line-up of 18 speakers," says IMC CEO, Dale Hefer. The IMC is presented in association with MASA and endorsed by the IAB.Book your spot at the Nedbank IMC 2020 with early bird tickets available right now.
