Their sporting careers started on the beach and in the surf as “Nipper” lifesavers, and progressed until representing South Africa in Surf Lifesaving. Dawid has won four World Surfski Series titles while Nikki has won world titles in Surf Lifesaving, Canoe Marathon and the World Surfski Series. She is also a 2008 Olympian placing seventh in the K4 500m final. Mocke’s slogan, "Passion Precedes Purpose", is so appropriate for the family business as their philosophy encourages people to pursue their passions and live their best life. Dawid also facilitates paddle workshops and coaching for performance enhancement.  PADDLEexpo is an exclusive paddle sports trade fair where the newest products and trends are featured. XZIBIT Marketing designed and provided a portable exhibition stand which included branding and product merchandising for the custom-designed lifejackets, apparel and accessories on offer. The stand was transported abroad and easily installed by the Mocke team at the expo. We are pleased to have assisted the brand with a professional, yet functional solution for their global  marketing objectives. Holding thumbs for the Kayak Session Magazine Products of the Year Award!
