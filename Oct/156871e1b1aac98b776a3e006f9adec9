The majority of the pieces also display an alteration of Diesel’s D Denim Division logo, which has been updated with text rendered in rainbow, and the phrase 'Denim Division' replaced by the word 'Pride'. In partnership with its parent company’s Only The Brave Foundation, Diesel globally has aligned with The Stonewall Inn Gives Back Initiative (SIGBI), the no-profit organisation that supports LGBTQ+ social initiatives worldwide, promoting tolerance and equality. "Diesel and OTB Foundation are proud and honoured to contribute to the cause of The Stonewall Gives Back Initiative, in remembrance and celebration of the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots," the company says in a release.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/518824.jpg" alt="Diesel launches Pride capsule collection" width="600" height="390"> Earlier this year Diesel posted in support of the LGBTQ+ community, resulting in over 14,000 people unfollowing the account on Instagram. Diesel says that having people who don't agree with its inclusion of diversity unfollow the brand is a blessing, and illustrated that much in another Instagram post in July:         View this post on Instagram           We’ve taken pride in our beliefs for 40+ years & we believe in #pride. For those who don’t, including the 14.000 followers who’ve left us in the last week.... bye bye! To those who share our beliefs and values, let’s celebrate the fact that #loveislove. Always.
