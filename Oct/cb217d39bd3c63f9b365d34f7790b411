This year’s theme is “Brand Building In A Challenging World”.Building a better future with young leaders In a time of economic, political and technological disruption, can today’s innovators and creative leaders help build a better future? It’s within that context that Epica partnered with the One Young World: The Global Forum for Young Leaders.In its own words, the forum “identifies, promotes and connects the world’s most impactful young leaders to create a better world, with more responsible, more effective leadership.”At the Creative Circle, these young leaders will join brand owners, agencies and the media at a series of roundtables. As many companies struggle to adapt to the pressures impacting their sectors – dramatically evidenced by the failure of legacy brands like Thomas Cook – the conversation will explore solutions that can help businesses and organisations thrive and survive.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/518636-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Thomas Cook." width="120" height="120">Lessons from the Thomas Cook collapseI believe that there are three key things that all businesses can learn from the collapse of Thomas Cook...By Regine le Roux 30 Sep 2019Matthew Belshaw, community relations director at One Young World, commented: “This new generation is the most informed, most educated, most connected generation in human history.
