<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/522510.jpg" alt="Machine MD appointed to Publicis Worldwide Team" width="233" height="350">The Publicis Groupe network of agencies and companies collectively form the world's third-largest communications group, known for its world-renowned creativity, best-in-class technology, digital and service. Through its powerful alchemy of creativity and technology, the group has earned a reputation for driving business transformation for its clients, across the entire value chain. Machine joined the Publicis Groupe in 2014, with McPherson then leading the creative team as Group Creative Director.  He has effectively led the agency creatively since its inception in 2012, guiding it through the ranks, from initial recognition as AdReview's Breakthrough Agency of the Year 2013, to currently ranking in the Top 10 Creative agencies in South Africa, and most recently being placed in the Top 5 Digital agencies’ rankings in the country. Over this time, the agency has delivered some of the industry’s best work. Gareth was appointed MD and Chief Creative Officer in early 2019. Gareth’s creative expertise and insight has been instrumental in positioning Machine as one of the country’s leading Brand Experience companies, with an impressive mix of blue chip brands among its longstanding clients – among these are Pernod Ricard SA, Red Bull, RCS, Emirates Airlines and Sanlam. "While Machine works independently as a business entity, I believe it’s important to stay connected and involved in matters pertaining to the group strategy, human resources, training and technology. My appointment to the Publicis Worldwide team will ensure that our company interests synergise with those of the group," says McPherson. In his personal capacity, McPherson’s work on a multitude of blue-chip brands has won a host of local and international awards, from Loeries and Bookmarks, to a number of top Cannes wins.
