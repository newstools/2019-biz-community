Humanity is trying to develop AI like children like a bomb.                                                                                                                  -        Nick Bostrom<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/521695-625x325.jpg?2" alt="Alix Rübsaam delivering this presentation at the Singularity U South Africa 2019 Summit." width="625" height="325">Alix Rübsaam delivering this presentation at the Singularity U South Africa 2019 Summit.The intelligence of machines will exceed that of humans. Computers will breach the limits of human cognition. There will be a hierarchy of intelligence with no humans on top.So, what does AI mean for humanity and does it actually pose a threat?

This is an important and relevant question for humankind. How is humanity represented in technology? And what does it mean to be human when AI is involved?We cannot take AI at face value without understanding the cultural context. AI is shaped by a specific time and place. It’s contextual, based on the most important technology of the time.Today we talk about downloading our cognition digitally, downloading the human brain. Everything alive has a certain electrical charge and this influences what artificial life looks like. It’s how we predict the world around us.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506830-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Franck V. on Unsplash" width="120" height="120">Key questions to consider before investing in AI for marketingAccuraCast director Jérôme Divecha offers clear advice to see if AI could help your business make the next big step forward...By Jérôme Divecha 17 Jul 2019Computational artificial intelligenceIt’s not just language, we are information processing entities. We take in all the data from a situation and process it – a personal algorithm generates an outcome. It’s all information exchange.Our physical health is input – diet, sleep, exercise – and output – a longer life expectancy. Have you ever heard these phrases?“Humans are hardwired to do this.”“AI is an upgrade to the neocortex.”“We’re gonna hack the microbiome.”“People are pre-programmed to think linearly.”But what if we could use computational metaphors to help ourselves? Essentially computers are doing what we do, but doing it better. They’re who we are but not what we are.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1803/433460-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#ECMA2018: Adopt a humanistic approach to AI" width="120" height="120">#ECMA2018: Adopt a humanistic approach to AIArtificial intelligence doesn't have to induce a Hollywood sci-fi dystopian nightmare in which robots take over the world. It may instead offer an exciting opportunity to connect consumers to your brand...By Maroefah Smith 16 Mar 2018This is only true as long as we define this reality as computational. Are we computers? The Greeks thought we were all hydraulic machinery. Maybe it’s silly but AI is a threat, not a threat to an organism or a species but to our contemporary definition of what it means to be human.
