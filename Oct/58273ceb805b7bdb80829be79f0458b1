The Ndlovu Youth Choir was at the centre of the performance, singing the South African classic Shosholoza. Formed in 2009, the Ndlovu Youth Choir is comprised of young people from the Ndlovu Care Group in the rural village of Moutse, Limpopo, and they have recently been in local and international news for their notable participation in the globally televised competition, America’s Got Talent.Lead by their artistic director, Ralf Schmitt, their electrifying performances had hearts swelling with pride, as they reached the finals of the intense contest – no small feat for a young singing ensemble. A few familiar faces were recognised in the crowd during the flash mob at Woolies, including Trevor Nyakane, and Victor Matfield; as well as the families of late rugby heroes, Chester Williams, James Small and Ruben Kruger, all there to offer their support for our boys in green and gold. "The festive atmosphere that the choir helped create in store on Saturday was energised and pitch-perfect. Between the singing, dancing and tears, we hope the team got our message, loud and clear," says Woolworths.
