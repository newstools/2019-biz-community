Listeners will get the chance to curate their perfect Sunday playlist along with DJ Fresh through his new music feature, Fresh’s 5 @ 5.

I look forward to connecting with the people of the Cape. The new show will reflect the Sunday vibe in the city, interaction with listeners, and the most music to make you feel great!
