The show seeks to recalibrate and reimagine the history of Africa and her people with creative meaning. What's Wrong with Groovin? is inspired by a Hugh Masekela composition, performed and popularised by Letta Mbulu. The show will be compiled and presented as an audio documentary. Tune in on Sundays between 14h00-18h00. Kaya FM’s MD, Greg Maloka, reflects on these new changes. At the back of winning Commercial Radio Station of the Year, we had plans around how we wanted to evolve the brand, and some conversations we wanted to solidify so if you think about the expansion of Karibu, as the home of the Afropolitan, that platform is important to us. We had initially brought in Kojo Baffoe to help us address issues around manhood through Life with Kojo, which he pioneered. Extending Karibu with Mike Siluma allows us to make those issues more continental. That is also something we see in What's Wrong with Groovin?, curated by DJ Kenzhero and Tha_Muzik. What's Wrong with Groovin? is a confluence of many impulses and gives us the opportunity to have a musical conversation about the journey of the freedom of Africa. We are very excited about being able to have a platform that draws from the words of Malcolm X, Miriam Makeba, Steve Biko, as well as the thoughts of many young activists of this day. Sotho Meyer comes in the morning. In a country where thousands of women wake up at the crack of dawn to prepare themselves and their families for a new day - whether in the suburbs or the townships - what are the conversations at that time of the morning? Having done exceptionally well with her weekend show focusing on children’s activities, Sotho is a wonderful addition to this morning slot. We loved what Shane Ngwenya brought to the space. That spiritual vibe was important: now we feel that it is time to take it to the next level. Influential Fridays brought some interesting people to the platform, and was to a large degree successful. TBose’s weekday show is one of our most loved on the station and we wanted to merge those together for Platinum Fridays, bringing in a premium selection of  lounge, house and soul music on a Friday afternoon. With My Money and Me, we understood that personal finance is a very deep issue. We also found  that there is a particular skill required for someone to have personal conversations and advice you on money – something that Thuli Magubane understood and she was the foundation for something important. We are excited to have Sumitra Nydoo taking this on as she understands the overall business philosophy at Kaya.
