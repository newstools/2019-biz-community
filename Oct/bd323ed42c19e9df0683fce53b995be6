Simply put, it’s a “longstanding quest to figure out which touchpoints are truly moving the needle,” in determining exactly which campaigns resulted in sales and how the various related marketing efforts influenced those purchase decisions. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1607/353374-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cost per attention - A new currency for advertisers" width="120" height="120">Cost per attention - A new currency for advertisersWe are living in an attention deficit economy where attention is now seen as a currency for advertisers...By Audrey Naidoo 27 Jul 2016As a result, the IAB’s morning session will cover a 360-view of digital’s role across publisher, agency, and brand, with Singh also presenting on how digital access for all will impact the digital marketing landscape. Singh explains:From a commercial perspective, increased access to the internet means an increased consumer base. The more people who are able to get online – and who have the relevant skills to use the internet meaningfully once they are online – will broaden the number of people participating in the digital economy. In seeking to bridge the various digital divides, such as the urban/rural divide in internet access, this has the potential to open up new markets that may have previously been untapped.If more consumers are able to get online, the benefits in respect of digital marketing become readily apparent: consumers are able to stay current and up-to-date on new products and service offerings; it is convenient and not bound by physical location; and consumers can access relevant information around the clock, at their own leisure.However, there is also a broader public interest consideration that is relevant. If we share a common vision for a more equal and just society – in which all persons have access to equal opportunities – then access to the internet must further be recognised as a crucial enabler for the full array of fundamental rights, to ensure that all persons are able to participate equally in the socio-economic opportunities that the country has to offer.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1608/357814-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The Hansel and Gretel of advertising" width="120" height="120">The Hansel and Gretel of advertisingOnce upon a time there was a Brand and a Consumer.

If we adopt a South African lens, a handful of brands are actually getting integrated attribution right.The reason for this is simply that brands have been looking at attribution from a channel perspective and lost sight of the consumer. The consumer journey or path to purchase have evolved and no longer confined to a single channel or device.The foundation of building a robust integrated attribution model can be centred on three pillars: technology, a strong measurement framework and the transparency of data. We need to focus on the science of marketing in order to contribute to revenue growth in the future.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1607/352781-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Goodbye to competitive advantage, say hello to customer advantage" width="120" height="120">Goodbye to competitive advantage, say hello to customer advantageRemember the days when we were always following the leader and looking for ways to gain competitive advantage. We based our strategies on what our competitors were doing...By Audrey Naidoo 22 Jul 2016Many brands are still in the nascent stage trying to figure this out. There are contributing factors that provide context to the current state of attribution:• Marketers are passively reviewing post-campaign reports to make future decisions on campaigns often using vanity metrics like clicks, engagement and views.• Media buying is fragmented and consolidation is required from both an Adtech and Martech perspective. Both need to be inter-connected. • Transparency in the media value chain unlocking data and promoting visibility in the customer journey. Walled gardens are resistant to sharing data. • Consumers have access to multiples devices and shift across channels making it more difficult to measure true attribution. (Consumer journey is not linear). Customers are channel-agnostic. • Naming taxonomies are inconsistent leading to errors and non-identifiers of channel and message effectiveness.• A shift needs to happen from the marketing of campaigns to an always-on approach hence making data-led decisions and a shift towards continuous optimisation.• Marketers lack the correct skillset, tools, processes to produce meaningful analysis.• Integrated attribution is a journey, not a destination.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497542-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image supplied.

When thinking about last-click attribution, for instance, we can’t blame Google for citing a metric in which they scored particularly well. I would argue that it has caused a skewed understanding when it comes to analysing attribution metrics. In black and white, search attribution numbers look incredible, so there is a tendency to cut back on display and video when they don’t produce the same sort on numbers. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/512585-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Melissa Van Zyl, partner and head of strategy at M&amp;C Saatchi Connect with her team and IAB SA chairman, Chris Borain (AME) on the far right." width="120" height="120">IAB Insight Series: Benchmarking digital excellenceMelissa Van Zyl, partner and head of strategy at M&C Saatchi Connect, delivered the keynote presentation at the latest Cape Town session of the monthly IAB Insight Series last week...By Juanita Pienaar 22 Aug 2019The challenge is that marketers adopting this approach will find their search numbers dipping soon enough.

What conversations are you having with your clients around last-click attribution and the role publishers play in the conversion funnel? Nicholson: So many of our client conversations these days revolve around attribution. While clients are challenging us to produce qualified leads that they can convert, we are challenging them to place more value on the top- and mid-funnel interactions within our environment. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1608/355553-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Brand before marketing" width="120" height="120">Brand before marketingA name in itself does not constitute a brand.

Naidoo Digital has disrupted the marketing mix over the past decade due to the rapid advancement in tech, AI, ML and consumer behaviour on digital channels and devices.The traditional 4Ps are now the 7Ps - sometimes even 12Ps. The reason for the many iterations is due to the constant changes happening in the digital world. We have moved from adopting a passive view of the marketing mix into a more agile, ever-changing view of how we apply it into our marketing efforts.If I were to focus on the direct impact digital has had on the marketing mix, I would focus on the following contemporary version of the Ps:<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1611/366827-120x120.jpg?2" alt="123RF" width="120" height="120">Beyond a digital media buyEvery ad, every impression served results in an insight, a behaviour or an action. It maps out the customer journey down the path to purchase...By Audrey Naidoo 3 Nov 2016Product – products are co-created between brands and consumers. For example, Lego encourages ideas and designs from their fans on their online platforms. Fans can then vote on the best creations and the creator earns a percentage of the sales, completely disrupting the legacy way of developing products. This concept celebrates loyal customers and rewards them for innovation, creativity and entrepreneurialism.Process – Automation, systems and processes now play a critical role in the marketing mix. E-commerce entities like Amazon and Walmart can attribute their successes to their processes. Promotion – Included in promotion would be permission-based marketing, personalisation and partnerships. Marketers need to keep themselves abreast of the evolving changes of the marketing mix in order to deliver more effective marketing strategies and business outcomes. Nicholson: It’s interesting to note how digital has shifted to a very performance marketing-focused cycle lately, obviously due to the relative trackability of digital media vs other channels.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/484311-120x120.jpg?2" alt="From l-r: Michelle Beh, MD The Jupiter Drawing Room Cape Town, Basil Fortuin, digital publisher for 24.com, Media 24, Adhil Patel, global director at Kantar TNS, Kelly Driscoll, Sanlam Digital Group digital marketing and social media manager, Karin du Chenne, CEO South Africa, Insights Kantar TNS and Lotang Mokoena, a strategist from VML. © ." width="120" height="120">IAB Insight Series: These are the trends transforming the digital economyThe IAB Insight Series held its second event on The Future of Work, where a panel of experts in the field shared insights on trends transforming the digital economy...By Juanita Pienaar 25 Feb 2019But, without any brand saliency or awareness being created in the channel, the top of the funnel is being left unattended. This leaves the performance of campaigns scrambling to get as much relevant inventory and audience created out of basically 'thin air'.To bring it back to our own environment, we are often tasked with providing a solution that will be measured on a conversion metric.  However, the brands concerned spend no top- or mid-funnel budget within our environment. Moving forward, I would love to see the market place an appropriate value on digital channels' ability to drive activity at the top and middle of the funnel. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/482078.jpg" alt="It's official: mobile advertising works" width="120" height="120">It's official: mobile advertising worksThe SpaceStation and 24.com have released the findings from their mobile study, the first of its kind in South Africa...Issued by The SpaceStation 12 Feb 2019Our own mobile brand lift study conclusively proved that digital media is very effective at driving awareness, consideration and preference.

Switching focus to the publisher side then, please share an insight or learning you’ve gained by reviewing a campaign with regard to attributing performance or lack of performance within the campaign. Nicholson: I can think of several instances where we have worked with the client to drive attribution. This is only possible when working with a client who is open-minded about sharing their own data insights with us whether that be anecdotally, or preferably, giving us the ability to tag their own sites. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504586-120x120.jpg?2" alt="IAB Insight Series: The role of technology in achieving business objectives" width="120" height="120">IAB Insight Series: The role of technology in achieving business objectivesThe latest Johannesburg edition of the monthly IAB Insight Series took place at the Park Inn by Radisson in Sandton on Thursday, 27 June, this time focusing on the role of technology in enabling business performance in the digital economy...By Jessica Tennant 2 Jul 2019We have seen clear evidence with campaigns for some of our financial clients, for whom lead generation is a very important metric.When top-of-funnel activity was dropped or slowed down in our environment, within a week the knock-on effect was evident in our client’s numbers across the board, including last-click attribution efforts, which were focused on search.Also, by deploying more mid-funnel assets, where we built brand consideration and preference, we were able to drive the value of their leads in terms of quality and not just quantity. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important} What further changes do you predict we will see in this regard as we approach 2020?

Let’s end with some helpful tips to help SA marketers make better digital decisions.  Naidoo: 1. Start with defining a measurement framework for your business that considers media, analytics and business metrics.2. Attribution efforts should be a consistent effort. Start small and measure what you can. 3. Audit your current tech stack and define a strategy that’s closely aligned to your business goals. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/460685.jpg" alt="Brand safety: A matter of conscious partnership" width="120" height="120">Brand safety: A matter of conscious partnershipEvery business knows that their brand equity is as valuable as their bottom line...Issued by IAB South Africa 1 Oct 2018Nicholson: 1. Learn about attribution – really learn it, and understand that display and video are so important to the bottom-line of not just ROI, but ROAS – Return on Advertising Spend. You will convert better if you build salience and preference in the same channel you seek to convert from.2. Focus on making your own platforms a better customer experience. Ultimately, media partners can lead a horse to water, but we can’t make it drink. Much of what it takes to convert a customer is on the brand owner in the final phase. 3. If we all accept that mobile is no longer a trend but the reality of digital media, then marketers need to double down on their development of mobile-friendly assets. Many marketers are retaining desktop in the mix because they claim that it works better in the conversion phase. Truthfully, we believe this is because conversion assets are just not designed optimally for mobile formats. If you’re still asking for more detail than a name and email address in the mobile environment to generate leads, you won’t generate any. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1801/424970-120x120.jpg?2" alt="(c) Valentina Todorova -" width="120" height="120">2017 digital media learningsIt has practically taken me last year to figure out exactly what is going on behind my digital media buys.
