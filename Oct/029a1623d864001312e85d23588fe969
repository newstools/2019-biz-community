The rest of the world celebrates Pride Month in June to commemorate the Stonewall riots, which occurred at the end of June 1969.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/508964-120x120.png?2" alt="Johannesburg Pride Parade launches Pride of Africa" width="120" height="120">Johannesburg Pride Parade launches Pride of AfricaThe Johannesburg Pride Parade has launched Pride of Africa, which is intended to serve as a unified platform and voice for the community...29 Jul 2019Capitalising on pink capitalismDuring this time, international and local brands pledge their allegiance and support to the LGBTQIA+ community. They start tailoring their marketing communications campaigns to specifically attract this community and push business sales objectives.Known as pink capitalism, it’s a concept many queer scholars have written about. In a nutshell, pink capitalism is predicated on a set of assumptions that queer people fall outside the socially-accepted heteronormative ideology of a procreating heteropatriarchal nuclear family.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/497434-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Reebok launches 'Pride Collection' ahead of Pride Month" width="120" height="120">Reebok launches 'Pride Collection' ahead of Pride MonthReebok has released a limited edition 'Pride Collection' in recognition of Pride Month this June.

And, within this context, queer bodies tend to be portrayed within the extremities of femininity and hyper-masculinity; a perspective that reifies and reinforces the existence of queer bodies through the prism of the heteronormative male-female cis-gender binary.These representations, intentionally or unintentionally, fuel what Mikki (Marié Elizabeth) van Zyl refers to as homoprejudice.The above really sets the tone and purpose of this article – which is to challenge the dominant ways brands think about queerness and how it is portrayed, if at all, in our planned brand communications strategies and brand messaging.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/508759-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Coca-Cola Company." width="120" height="120">Fortune favours brave(r) brandsWith so many conservative groups lobbying against the LGBTQ+ community, only big brands can be brave enough to not injure their market share or upset their loyal conservatives, right?...By Arisha Saroop 26 Jul 2019Need for serious queer represenation This is important because many of our locally-supported brands enjoy the support of queer people without doing much to gain that support. Many studies conducted in the US, UK and Germany show the immense contribution queer people make towards the global economy – which sits just above $700bn annually.Yet, little-to-no full representation of the community can be spotted and related to in an authentic manner in advertising – especially in South Africa.This, perhaps, alludes to a broader conversation that needs to be had around how marketing is done for the queer communities. And why it seems that they are deliberately alienated from product development, design and marketing.Not only during Pride Month but throughout the year.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/481043-120x120.jpg?1" alt="Woolworths pulls &amp;quot;gender stereotyping&amp;quot; Valentine's Day campaign" width="120" height="120">Woolworths pulls "gender stereotyping" Valentine's Day campaign#NEWSWATCH: Woolworths has pulled its in-store #LoveAlwaysWins Valentine's Day campaign following social media outrage, this just a few weeks after the retailer's Ubuntu Baba scandal...5 Feb 2019The above is probably where it needs to begin and the ideal solution given the fact that we are one of the most progressive countries in the world when it comes to recognising gay rights and the leading African country in so far as championing this cause.A starting point – and where we honestly need to do a deep dive – is by looking at the many brands are loved by this queer community and asking how they can be included and fairly represented.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1807/448896-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The Hidden Flag" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Not-so-secretly supporting Pride Month with Russia's #thehiddenflagThe Fifa World Cup settled the global gaze on Russia for the past few weeks. While July 2018 has been a time of football celebration, it's also Pride Month. So while 'gay propaganda' is still banned in Russia, that doesn't mean there's been a lack of rainbow support - where there's will, there's a way...By Leigh Andrews 16 Jul 2018Quite frankly, Pride Month – in my humble opinion – is more than just about buying expensive flamboyant garments and parading on the streets of Sandton. It is also a time that should be about raising consciousness, legitimating the existence of queer people and driving change.From where I sit, brands and marketing should play a bigger role in contributing to this narrative. And bring deep, meaningful engagement on this matter with the communities that support their beloved brands during this time.
