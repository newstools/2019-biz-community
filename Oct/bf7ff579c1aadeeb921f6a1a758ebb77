Brand recognition is more than that.It’s the expectations people have when they hear the name of the business and the feelings that gives them. But it’s also the values and emotions that the thought of the business evokes. It is, in other words, what keeps customers coming back time after time. A large part of the reason successful companies grow so big is that they excel at brand recognition, but technology is making it easier for smaller businesses to catch up. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/518217-120x120.jpg" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty." width="120" height="120">WhatsApp revolutionising business communicationBusinesses in Africa can't ignore WhatsApp as a potential connection point to customers to revolutionise their user experience...25 Sep 2019The value of brand recognitionAn easy way to understand the value of brand recognition is to think about your own day-to-day life. If you’re hungry, how often do you find yourself going to the same national or international fast-food franchise you always go to rather than that cool hole-in-the-wall place you discovered one Saturday? Even if the food’s better at the latter, you’ve come to associate the former as the place you go whenever you’re hungry. With that in mind, it’s worth looking at how smaller businesses can build the kind of brand recognition that not only gets customers coming back to the business time after time, but also recommending it to their friends and family. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/487731-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Why every brand should focus on organic social media marketing" width="120" height="120">Why every brand should focus on organic social media marketingBrian Mechem lists reasons why B2B brands should implement organic social media marketing...By Brian Mechem 15 Mar 2019Tell a story, make it personal One of the most powerful ways to build brand recognition is to tell a story. Who started the business? Why did they do it? What is the business trying to achieve? These are all things that should be made clear to a customer from the first moment they interact with the business. Customers are much more likely to remember brands that reach them on a personal or emotional level. But it’s also important to remember that if a business wants to retain customers, they need to feel like they’re a part of the business’s ongoing story. That doesn’t just mean keeping them up-to-date with any new hires, expansion efforts and community initiatives. It also means providing them with offers and insights that are unique to them as individuals. While it’s possible to achieve this to a degree with social media, a much more effective way is to build up a database of customers you can contact through SMS. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517306-120x120.jpg?2" alt="4 ways brands can incorporate chat messaging into their marketing strategy" width="120" height="120">4 ways brands can incorporate chat messaging into their marketing strategyChat messaging has become an effective communication channel between customers and businesses...By Wayne Flemming 19 Sep 2019The magic of SMS and the webThat’s not to say social media and other channels aren’t important. They undoubtedly are. But when it comes building brand recognition, SMS is still the ultimate weapon in any small business’s arsenal.  This is especially true in a mobile-first market like South Africa, where there are an estimated 90-million mobile connections.SMS also doesn’t require the customer to be online and, importantly, doesn’t cost them anything to receive. Moreover, it’s incredibly effective. Research shows that 98% of all SMSes are opened and that, on average, it takes someone 90 seconds to respond.As such, it’s vital that small businesses focus on building customer databases that include phone numbers from the start. Providing incentives in the shape of specials and discounts is a great way to do this. And once they’ve built those databases, businesses need to understand that rather than viewing the SMS as the medium for delivering their message, they should see it as the hook for something more personalised and visually appealing. Using Smart SMS technology, SMEs can direct customers to personalised web pages – with specials, offers and discounts that are relevant to them. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/509715-120x120.jpg?3" alt="Image credit: Tumisu from Pixabay." width="120" height="120">Here's what SMEs need to know about using their customer communication channels effectivelyThere are a few basic things every business can do to ensure that its communication strategy is as effective as possible...By Greg Chen 2 Aug 2019Appealing to me Creating that sense of relevance is vital.
