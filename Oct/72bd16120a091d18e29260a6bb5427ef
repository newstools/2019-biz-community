During the 16-week period, the four participants open their hearts and homes to the promise of a healthier life.We caught up with Afrika-Bredenkamp who shared with us a bit more about the show and what else she is currently busy with. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Congrats on the new show. How do you feel about it?Delighted! I’m busy running an office in Cape Town and Johannesburg but, clearly, I had more time. At the moment Afskaal makes me feel like there is hope for everyone with a dream. Fynskrif on Kyknet, the drama series I was cast in, happens to start in the same week that Afskaal is launching, on the same channel. My cup runneth over. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why do you think this show was needed and why did you want to be a part of it?Every show that sparks interest is necessary. Everyone in life somewhere somehow has wanted to lose weight, or live a healthier lifestyle. Afskaal is the vehicle for our four contestants. I share good news. Always. This is one of those shows that makes you feel like “I am not alone." I love being the bearer of that kind of news.    View this post on Instagram  My positive pants are ON next to @mj_fitness_south_africa �� �� #Shoot #AFSKAAL lekerrrrrrrr ��A post shared by  Elana Afrika-Bredenkamp (@elanaafrika) on Oct 5, 2019 at 5:50am PDT.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What excites you most about this show?The challenges.
