Experiences are in!The speakers have been announced for the #UJMarketingFit Experience...Issued by Boo-Yah! 3 Sep 2019Solving tomorrow’s problems, today The event was born from a co-creative partnership between Boo-Yah and the UJ department of marketing management to create a memorable and innovative learning experience for the audience. The event theme was “solving tomorrow’s problems today”. The diverse speaker lineup, hand-picked and organised by Boo-Yah founder Carmen Murray, and the topics discussed truly pushed the limits of the business ecosystem. The event commenced with everyone singing the South African National anthem as a call to unite and stand together to effectively deal with the issues that South African society and businesses are faced with.   The space created was conducive for honest conversation and to drive change. Instead of focusing on trends, the event allowed for speakers to shed light on some of the most pressing issues currently affecting – not only the marketing industry but the business environment as a whole, and how marketers/business professionals have a responsibility to be aware and engage with these problems in their organisations. All was not too serious either. About today at the UJMarketingFit Experience!
