One of those practical considerations is a film fund. Normally things like funding take years to actually materialise, but with the support of council, we are hoping we can pilot the film fund immediately because we realise the need to address this issue.“This is an important industry because not only does it provide entertainment for us, it is a great contributor to the local economy with about R3.5bn a year and employs thousands of people,” said the mayoral committee member for safety and security, JP Smith.#ThisWeekInCT The City of Cape Town’s Executive Mayor, Alderman Dan Plato, and Mayoral Committee Member for Safety and Security, Alderman JP Smith, visited the film studio at the City-owned Good Hope Centre as the production team prepares for an international production. pic.twitter.com/5ULgRClJ25— City of Cape Town (@CityofCT) May 25, 2019During the film industry engagement, the City also committed to providing more support to the sector through: Unlocking more film locationsKeeping the zero-tariffContinuing to market the film destination through the Film Cape Town initiativeFurther reviewing the establishment of a film entity The City is also supporting more film industry events, through funding or municipal services, which help showcase the work being produced in Cape Town in the film and new media sectors.
