It’s reported that up to a third of South African female children grow up in disadvantaged homes, destined to be trapped in a continuous cycle of poverty which makes them particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, teenage pregnancies and the threat of HIV/Aids.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1801/427465-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#NewCampaign: You'd never believe what some school girls use as substitutes to sanitary pads" width="120" height="120">#NewCampaign: You'd never believe what some school girls use as substitutes to sanitary padsDuring my adolescent years, an endless supply of sanitary pads 'magically' appeared in my toiletry cupboard.

This ‘network’ of independent and autonomous grassroots organisations currently operates from 75 sites across South Africa in remote, rural, semi-urban and urban areas across the country, providing structural and practical daily care to the most vulnerable and needy of children. To date, more than 100 companies including Ford, Pick n Pay and Investec have provided support to the Mamas Alliance, which helps more than 60,000 vulnerable children in South Africa on a daily basis, via 2,000 dedicated and committed Mamas. One of the trends we have been noticing is that the needs of girls are not being adequately addressed, given the high rate of teen pregnancies and high rate of school dropouts amongst teenage girls. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1802/430935-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Lebo Mashile in conversation with Leigh Andrews at Design Indaba." width="120" height="120">#DesignIndaba2018: 'Advice for the African girl child' - Lebo MashileLebo Mashile on African females as the future of humanity, the importance of having a mentor in the industry and honouring the legacy of Hugh Masekela...By Leigh Andrews 26 Feb 2018As a result, in 2016 we began to look for a potential national initiative, specifically aimed at addressing the needs of girls. The PowerGirls programme is being funded for the first three years by the Dutch National Postcode Lottery, which has supported Netherlands-based NGO Kinderfonds Mamas for the past 20 years. Kinderfonds Mamas raises funds for childcare organisations in South Africa, with a robust monitoring, reporting and evaluation process developed in order to measure success and impact, with specific outcomes and indicators designed for each workshop session. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/463043-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: How sending girls to school changes the economy" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: How sending girls to school changes the economyEver thought the answer to breaking the country's poverty cycle was as simple as improving basic education for females?

Explain the name 'PowerGirls'. As MAMAS Alliance, one of our war cries, or mottos, is ‘Mama Power’, a saying which is printed on our tee-shirts and badges. It was, therefore, a natural progression to extend this power to girls with the name ‘PowerGirls’. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Love that. Talk us through your actions so far. Our aim with the PowerGirls programme is to see vulnerable girls become achievers in their communities: attending and completing school, gaining skills in order to become contributing and healthy members of society and valuable members of the future workforce, and fewer girls succumbing to teenage pregnancies. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/521952.jpg" alt="Mamas Alliance's PowerGirls.

The PowerGirls programme has the potential to break the cycle of poverty for so many vulnerable girls and allow them an opportunity to achieve great things.Fun plays an essential role in the programme, which takes place on a weekly basis. In total, 40 PowerGirl sessions, consisting value-centred activities emphasising experiential learning, are planned for each year, including learning activities, talks, games, role-plays and outings. The activities combine to form a layered programme that offers solutions to multiple issues including fun in safety, education, life skills and self-care, self-awareness, leadership, giving back, health, awareness of environmental issues, and group identity. Sessions are conducted by trained facilitators, assisted by a co-ordinator and each group consists of two age groups, of between 16 to 24 girls: a nine- to 12-year-old group, and a 13- to 16-year-old group. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1710/415234-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Girls4Tech looks to empower the next generation of problem-solvers" width="120" height="120">Girls4Tech looks to empower the next generation of problem-solversCoinciding with International Day of the Girl Child, Mastercard recently launched the African leg of its Girls4Tech programme...19 Oct 2017Girls are rewarded for their progress throughout the programme with badges.
