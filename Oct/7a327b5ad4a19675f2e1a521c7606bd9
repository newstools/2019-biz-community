They will surely be confounded by media policy in the post-broadcast era by looking at these two events. And they will struggle to reconcile what is claimed to be policy against what is actually practised on the ground...By Derek Abdinor 17 Sep 2019“We call for justice for Jamal Khashoggi and an end to this charade of innocence, deflection and diversion – which does nothing but perpetuate a level of impunity that chills the entire profession of journalism,” said Wan-Ifra president Fernando de Yarza Lopez-Madrazo.“Mr Khashoggi’s death and the circumstances surrounding it remain a stain on our collective conscience and are an insult to the laws and protections that are supposed to govern the international system.

But he never came out.For the next two weeks, the Saudi government denied any knowledge about Khashoggi’s whereabouts, claiming that he had left the consulate after an hour. Then, on 20 October, state television reported that he had been murdered in an operation ordered by a Saudi intelligence officer.However, conflicting information about his disappearance continued to surface, with differing reports on how Khashoggi had died. More than a month later, Saudi Arabia’s attorney-general admitted that he had been given a lethal injection inside the consulate and that his death had been premeditated.Crimes left unanswered Since Khashoggi’s murder, 11 people have been charged over the journalist’s death – with five facing the death penalty. However, none of those charged have been identified, despite intelligence reports from multiple global sources – including the CIA – supporting the theory of official Saudi involvement.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/468023.jpg" alt="#FairnessFirst: Why investigative journalism and media freedom matters" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Why investigative journalism and media freedom mattersIt's becoming harder than ever to 'kill the story' in these technologically advanced times...By Leigh Andrews 12 Nov 2018In a report released in June 2019, the UN special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, Agnes Callamard, concluded there was credible evidence of individual liability amongst high-level Saudi officials, including Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.The UN report stated that Khashoggi’s killing violated six international laws “and was the result of elaborate planning involving extensive coordination and significant human and financial resources.”AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/488217.jpg" alt="#HumanRightsDay: The human cost of journalism globally" width="120" height="120">#HumanRightsDay: The human cost of journalism globallyThe Committee to Protect Journalists releases 'The Last Column' book to highlight the human cost of journalism around the globe.
