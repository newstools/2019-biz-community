Revisiting this vital ‘About Us’ content can be a starting point in ensuring core company information and values remain relevant or the reevaluation of how they may have shifted due to changing market conditions since they were first written.Why is vision important?According to Forbes, “Employees who find their company’s vision to be meaningful have average engagement scores of 68%, while the average for those who don’t is down around 18% – a sizeable difference! Interact-intranet.comCleverism.com states: “By creating a vision statement, you are boosting the long-term success of the organization through better strategic planning. You define the values and the guiding objectives for the business, making it easier to plan future actions. But you are also improving the bottom line because you align the business’ processes with the vision and you inspire your employees and stakeholders to subscribe to your vision... get to the heart of what it is your business does”.How a Biz Press Office can clarify vision inside and outThe “glass box” nature of a Biz Press Office offers a shop window, which effectively communicates corporate vision both internally and outwards to external prospects and stakeholders. These vision statements can be core to your company’s content strategy.“About 70% of workers don’t understand company’s vision at all. Not only is this bad for engagement but if an employee doesn’t understand the company vision, they likely don’t understand specific goals either.
