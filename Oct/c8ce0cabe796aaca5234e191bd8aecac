The achievement capped off a successful night for multiple award-winning creative agency M&C Saatchi Abel, which had seven clients among the list of brands honoured at the prestigious awards, voted for by the public. M&C Saatchi Abel Founding Partner & Group Managing Director, Jason Harrison, said Heineken winning the number-one beer brand yet again is validation of a successful eight-year partnership. “This award is the result of a true team effort between agency and client – being able to achieve the top accolade for three years running is testament to this.” Another M&C Saatchi Abel client, Nando’s, showed up well in multiple categories. Nando’s placed second in the top sit-down restaurant category, third in the top fast-food restaurant category and rounded out the top five in the condiment and sauces category. The success of the M&C Saatchi Abel & Nando’s partnership echoed the accolade the duo received at the 2019 Loeries, where they won the Film, TV & Cinema Commercials Grand Prix for their Nando's Afro-tising campaign. This is the second year in a row that they have won a Grand Prix with the 2018 Loeries Grand Prix going to Nando's for the Right My Name campaign. Other M&C Saatchi Abel clients that were celebrated at the 2019 Sunday Times Top Brand Awards included Yardley, Windhoek, Hollard, MWEB and Netflix, who featured across a broad range of diverse categories. “We are really proud of the work we are doing with our clients and having the vote of confidence from the public is the cherry on top. It means we are doing work that is proudly South African, for South Africans,” concludes Harrison.
