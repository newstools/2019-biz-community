THB’s senior strategist, Thobeka Sibiya, contributed to the 2019 report to share her perception and understanding on the trending topic, ‘Brand Purpose’. Sibiya reveals, “The hype around ‘Brand Purpose’ has hit the South African marketing industry hard. Unfortunately, despite advertisers zoomed-in attention on it, a sad reality remains. Although there’s a clear understanding as to why brands should have brand purpose, there’s very limited knowledge as to how to define one.” In her article submission, Sibiya expressed that consumers are looking at companies and brands to address challenging social and environmental issues. Some brands tend to confuse their purpose with their brand promise, while others aren’t sure how to add real value to the lives of their consumers. In the piece Sibiya goes on to showcase good examples of local brands who get ‘purpose’ right as seen in the Sunlight case study.“It’s all about showing consumers that brands do care, don’t jump on the bandwagon if you can’t commit to an authentic purpose.”Read more about this thought-provoking piece here: http://online.pubhtml5.com/bydd/bgyj/#p=112
