The problem is likely understated because crimes of this nature tend to go unreported.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/520781.png" alt="Image from a" width="575" height="346">Image from a report by BloombergThat’s why Wesley Mathew, Meltwater’s head of marketing for UKI and India, has started the crowdfunding campaign – aiming to raise R100,000 for programmes that seek to help change male-held beliefs and attitudes that contribute to violent behaviour against women. He says: The time for complacency is over; it's time for men in South Africa to stand up - and I believe #ItStartsWithMe.All this while Mathew’s colleague Philippa Dods, marketing manager for Meltwater Africa, is gearing up  to run the New York Marathon for Khayelitsha-based social justice non-profit organisation Nonceba, which provides a safe haven of accommodation, food, resources and counselling to mothers and children who have been raped and sexually abused.         View this post on Instagram           Next month I’ll be running the New York Marathon for Nonceba - a social justice nonprofit organization based in Khayelitsha that provides a safe haven of accommodation, food, resources and counselling to mothers and children who have been raped and sexually abused. I’m SO EXCITED to announce that you can be a part of it, too. I’m hosting a Rooftop Cocktail Party on Friday the 25th of October - and you’re invited to join in on the champagne and canapés while making a life-defining impact on the lives of women and children in South Africa. 100% of proceeds from the event will be donated to Nonceba. See my Nonceba highlight reel for more, and get your ticket by clicking the link in my bio. See you there! A post shared by  Philippa Dods (@philippadods) on Sep 30, 2019 at 11:32pm PDT Mathew himself has seen a lot of men posting on social media with regard to gender-based violence, but very few practical opportunities to actually make an impact. That’s why he’s hoping for this to become a potential avenue for men to get involved. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/520779.jpg" alt="Wesley Mathew, founder of the #ItStartsWithMe crowdfunding campaign." width="625" height="568">Wesley Mathew, founder of the #ItStartsWithMe crowdfunding campaign.A significant part of Brothers for Life sees men working with men to affect attitudes towards women, both through national-level public health communication campaigns and community and grassroots initiatives that seek to facilitate behaviour change.Here, Mathew explains what inspired him to take a stand and collaborate with Brothers For Life, as well as why it’s so important for men to take a stand and not take offence when females say they don’t feel safe. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Let’s start with some context: There’s been quite a bit of backlash on the #MenAreTrash hashtag. Why is it so important for men to take a stand and not take offence when females say they don’t feel safe? First off, I understand that no one likes being called "trash" on a personal level – but, as with any statement, it needs to be viewed in context.South Africa is wounded, and that hashtag is the symbolic representation of a lot of pain, frustration and fear all rolled into one. To me, #MenAreTrash is a clarion call for action on the part of men – not an attack on my character as a person.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515326.jpg" alt="From #MeToo to #AmINext: How to address gender-based sexual violence in the workplace" width="120" height="120">From #MeToo to #AmINext: How to address gender-based sexual violence in the workplaceEarlier this week, #AmINext flooded social media as women in South Africa drew attention to the magnitude of gender-based sexual violence, rape and murder taking place throughout the country...By Nadine Mather and Lusanda Raphulu 5 Sep 2019I think guys need to employ empathy here, and recognise that this is not an assault on them, but rather the symptom of a nation that's deeply hurting..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What inspired you to take a stand and collaborate with #BrothersForLife?A few things. I'd be lying if I said it wasn’t first and foremost serious concern for the women closest to me: my mom, my family and friends. Of course, I recognise that there’s also a larger, more systemic problem that's intertwined with all sorts of other social maladies – including unemployment, poverty and education. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/512148.jpg" alt="Step it up: Let's stop perpetuating gender stereotypes in SA media" width="120" height="120">Step it up: Let's stop perpetuating gender stereotypes in SA mediaThis Women's Month, UN Women South Africa Multi-Country Office (SAMCO) and the German Development Cooperation (GIZ) calls on the media to be more mindful of the kind of content they create and share...Issued by [dot]Good 19 Aug 2019The way I look at it, however, is that you can either start somewhere and be part of the solution, or simply resign yourself to a bleak future outside of your control. My conscience wouldn't allow for the latter, and I think people like Greta Thunberg are living examples of how individuals can spark monumental change. I think if we're all waiting on the government to do something about gender-based violence, we're going to be waiting a long time. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What’s your ultimate end-game goal for the crowdfunding campaign? I think a lot of men feel powerless to do something about the issue of widespread gender-based violence; so firstly, I wanted to give guys a tangible route to make an impact if they wanted to. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519427-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Screen grab from #WhoWillYouHelp?" width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Canada's #WhoWillYouHelp hits home in SAIn a time where femicide has faded somewhat from headlines but fear still lurks beneath the surface, an overseas ad is making an impact on social media feeds as it calls for action...By Leigh Andrews 7 Oct 2019Research shows that behavioural-change communication works; there's ample evidence in support of that. Also, campaigns like Brothers for Life are notoriously underfunded, so I had also hoped that the exposure might lead to other donors getting on-board. We need guys in SA to stand up, and start taking a proactive role in the fight against gender-based violence or we'll never move forward. These types of campaigns have been running in Kenya for years and have seen a great impact, so I sincerely believe they're worth standing behind.  Secondly, I hoped to incentivise more men to think of proactive ways to make a difference. If you don't have the financial means to support a charity, then perhaps volunteer your skills or time in a way that could help a relevant cause. If you want to start closer to home, consider setting up a community watch programme in your neighbourhood or perhaps forming a WhatsApp group to monitor popular school routes or playground areas.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516127.jpg" alt="Not in my name - gender violence in the workplace" width="120" height="120">Not in my name - gender violence in the workplaceEmployers can play a critical role in stigmatising violence against women and ensuring that perpetrators are ostracised from civilised society.

We need to change certain male-held attitudes and beliefs that might act as precursors to violent behaviour against women. At the same time, we have to mitigate physical risk to vulnerable parties, where possible. Being a good role model is simply the bare minimum, in my opinion..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What has the response been like so far? We've raised over R16,000, so far, with super-limited promotion, which is genuinely heartwarming to see. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1707/402902-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Ioulia Bolchakova © –" width="120" height="120">#CSIMonth: Going beyond armchair activismThere's been a rise in criticism for only performing acts of good on Mandela Day, but there's a similar trend of eye-rolling at the clicktivism of keyboard warriors or ‘slacktivists'...By Leigh Andrews 24 Jul 2017I think there will always be a contingent of people whose 'fight for change' will start and end with hollow social media posts, but those are not the men I care to engage with.
