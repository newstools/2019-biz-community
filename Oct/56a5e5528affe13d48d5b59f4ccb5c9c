To develop guidelines for influencer digital marketing campaigns.  To identify the risks and key areas of focus specific to digital influencer marketing.

Investments in this field across all industries and brands now play a key role in the implementation of most marketing strategies. It is a young industry that currently lacks standards, definitions, best practices and benchmarks. Through the strategic decision of setting up this Digital Influencer Council, the IAB is globally leading the process of improving standards in the industry, and I’m deeply honoured to be nominated to fill the seat of Council Lead. I look forward to driving this initiative with these industry leaders who have now been nominated to the Council.” Stephane Rogovsky, IAB SA Digital Influencer Marketing lead and CEO of R-Squared Digital. We kick off with the IAB Insight Series Event: Digital Influencer Marketing at Kantar in Cape Town on 28 November 2019, where IAB SA Digital Influencer Committee lead, Stephane Rogovsky, is also the key note speaker.
