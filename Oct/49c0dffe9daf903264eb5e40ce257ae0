We’ve evolved from a niche business borne out of a desire to become diversified to a global, recognizable brand with a worldwide presence. Our entrepreneurial edge is still a part of our DNA.”“Pacinamix has continuously raised the bar in the industry, leading the way in creativity and brand personality, coupled with a disruptive streak and entrepreneurial edge – a driving factor that has been the cornerstone of the business. It is imperative for our brand to reflect and promote our business as it is today and the tremendous value we bring.”At the heart of the rebrand is also a desire to bring a sharp new understanding of what the brand stands for, characterizing it as evolving and original. The business name itself falls into this spectrum of redefinition. “Pacinamix, inspired by the word ‘pasina’, which in Shona means ‘from nothing’ is a reflection of our science of execution in that from nothing, something unique and powerful can be created – an idea that can grow into something bigger than imagined. This is how we live our #Zero2Hundred ethos.”The new brand persona underpinned by this #Zero2Hundred creative approach represents the brand’s bold ambition and the unrelenting drive to excellence - what the team loosely refer to as their method of “Brief to Brilliance”. “Zero to Hundred sums up our cited values and communicating the focus of our brand philosophy was an exciting challenge. We gave a great deal of thought to how we could transform our defined values into a short, succinct and simultaneously meaningful brand claim. Thus “Zero to Hundred” came into being.”At the heart of this approach is also a desire to bring a sharp new visual identity and mission, characterising the brand as evolving and original. The business’ emphasis on providing a full suite of creative offerings to local and global brands alike is reflected in this. Through a pioneering and co-creating spirit, Pacinamix has not only demonstrated what it takes to be a successful business but the team has continuously demonstrated the strength of their strategic creativity and passion for globally-renowned brands within the retail (QSR), public sector, mining, business management and government spheres. “This is an exciting time for our business. We have always been encouraged to be innovative and disruptive and the evolution of our brand underpins this,” concludes Zungu.
