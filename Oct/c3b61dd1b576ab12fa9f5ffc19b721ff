The theme of this year’s conference centres around TBWA\’s Disruption culture and the theme this year is simply DISRUPT. Delegates from 20 national markets are expected to attend the conference.“This is a rally cry to our African Collective. It is a reminder that we need to continually challenge conventions and always question the status quo as this is the only way that we will remain relevant and competitive. As the broader business outlook becomes more uncertain and clients face greater challenges, businesses will look increasingly for creative solutions,” explains Graham Cruikshanks, Director of Africa Operations at TBWA\ South Africa.Disrupt represents the tools and philosophy that drives TBWA\ to be the kind of agency partner which provides solutions. Additionally it also challenges the collective to look inward at our business, to focus on how we operate, how we bring new technologies into our agencies and how we disrupt our own models to ensure we are future-fit agency partners for 21st Century African clients.“We plan to maintain momentum into 2020. Affiliates are building volumes by providing more services in each market while exploring cross-border opportunities,” says Cruikshanks.The gala event will be hosted on 31 October 2019, where members of the TBWA\ Africa collective are recognised for their creative work and ability to disrupt the norms of the advertising industry in their local markets and across the continent.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/522401.png" alt="TBWA\ Africa Conference to be held in Johannesburg" width="299" height="299"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/522402.png" alt="TBWA\ Africa Conference to be held in Johannesburg" width="299" height="299"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/522404.png" alt="TBWA\ Africa Conference to be held in Johannesburg" width="299" height="299"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/522405.png" alt="TBWA\ Africa Conference to be held in Johannesburg" width="299" height="299"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/522406.png" alt="TBWA\ Africa Conference to be held in Johannesburg" width="299" height="299"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/522407.png" alt="TBWA\ Africa Conference to be held in Johannesburg" width="299" height="299">
