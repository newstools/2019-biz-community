Lehlongwane has worked closely with reputable brands to create innovative and effective campaigns for the likes of ABSA, The Coca-Cola Company, Vodacom, SA Tourism, Sasol, Toyota, Uber SA, Jameson and Netflorist, amongst many other significant names.  "One of the things that drew me to Riverbed is the palpable sense of entrepreneurialism that flows through agency," he remarked, reflecting on the multidimensional nature of this assignment. "I think we have all the ingredients to not only deliver results for clients, but to build a business with long term value.""With any luck we'll also get to reshape the way we think about the way agencies are built. As it stands, Riverbed sits at the nexus between a multitude of disciplines - PR, branding, social and content, data analytics, and media – all of which already creates a more organic approach to agility and data driven integration. Our growth almost demands us to push more boundaries," added Lehlongwane.Zwambila is pleased to have this respected strategist form part of Riverbed. She said, “Lehlongwane has spent the last decade delivering pitch wins and awards so he is ideally suited to lead the charge as we work towards creating a new business proposition that is more disruptive and will further boost agency growth and help realise our business goals.”
