This year marks the ninth year the group has been operational in South Africa and currently has a presence in three locations, i.e. Durban, Cape Town and Johannesburg (Head Office). While the core business in the South African branches remained events and exhibitions, early in the year GL events SA took another stride in the industry and extended its business operations to venue management when the Group officially acquired 60% of the Johannesburg Expo Centre (JEC). The JEC is the largest exhibition, conference, congress and event venue in South Africa; a unique purpose-built centre and also one of the most eminent sites in Johannesburg. The venue offers more than 150,000 sqm of useable space, 20,000-plus parking bays and is one of the few venues with ample outdoor activation space. Venue management has been in the GL events group deliverables which currently manages a network of over 50 venues in France, Europe, South America, Asia and of course the latest acquisition in South Africa. In 2018 GL events Venues achieved a turnover of 321 million euro, amounting to 31% of the overall group turnover. The network of venues consists of modern and versatile venues that could cater for any kind of event. These venues in their uniqueness consist of convention centres, exhibition centres, reception venues, multi-purpose halls, etc. The unique and diverse range of event venues can easily host every kind of event. Some of the venues in the network that are striking because of their illustrious features and locations are:  Aichi Sky Expo, Japan Aichi Sky Expo, one of the biggest exhibition and event centres in Japan.
