Given the refusal of Associated Newspapers to resolve this issue satisfactorily, we have issued proceedings to redress this breach of privacy, infringement of copyright and the aforementioned media agenda.History repeating itselfThe announcement was followed by a statement issued by Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, in which he claims that the campaign against his wife has been escalated over the past year. “Unfortunately, my wife has become one of the latest victims of a British tabloid press that wages campaigns against individuals with no thought to the consequences – a ruthless campaign that has escalated over the past year, throughout her pregnancy and while raising our newborn son.”He also states that up to now, they have been unable to correct the continual misrepresentations – something he claims these select media outlets have been aware of and have therefore exploited on a daily and sometimes hourly basis.He also referred to what happened to his mother, Princess Diana and warned that history could be repeating itself. Though this action may not be the safe one, it is the right one. Because my deepest fear is history repeating itself. I’ve seen what happens when someone I love is commoditised to the point that they are no longer treated or seen as a real person. I lost my mother and now I watch my wife falling victim to the same powerful forces.Read his full statement here.
