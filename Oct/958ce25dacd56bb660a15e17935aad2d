Picture from Amasa Joburg Facebook page.The Agency of the Year Award was a tie between Playmakers and Dentsu Redstar. This is the second year in a row that Playmakers has won Agency of the Year. “We extend huge congratulations to the team at Dentsu Redstar, who impressed the judges with their award-winning entry in the Best Use of Mobile category, for Heineken’s, “When you drive, never drink” campaign which cinched the Roger Garlick Grand Prix Award.” Says Taryn Naledi Hood, Amasa Awards Committee.There were a number of new categories that were added to the Amasa Awards in 2019 to accommodate the growth and development of the industry. In order to remain on par with global standards agencies and awards are taking on a more integrated approach as digital becomes more and more entrenched in the marketing mix.“Once again a big thank you to the industry, agencies, media owners, clients and judges who support and build the industry. As an NGO this would never have happened without our sponsors; The MediaShop, Christopher Africa, Contact Media & Communications, Gumtree, Heart FM, East Coast Radio, Jacaranda FM, Kaya FM, Mediamark, Spark Media, Relativ Media and Publicis Media,” concludes Charlie Wannell, Amasa Awards Committee.
