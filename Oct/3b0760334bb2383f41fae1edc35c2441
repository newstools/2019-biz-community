The series has continuously brought viewers a taste of the good life by showcasing some of South Africa’s grandest homes, explored a magnitude of breath-taking countries, brought South Africans closer to some of the biggest stars around the world, hung out with our local celebrities and witnessed many of them say ‘I Do’. Top Billing has, for years, been a place where viewers stepped out of their world and into the glamorous world of entertainment, lifestyle, fashion, travel, décor and design, catapulting it to the forefront of South African television. Top Billing is the longest-running entertainment and lifestyle television programme in South Africa. It’s been an exceptional 25 years of growth as a producer and co-owner of Tswelopele Productions. The privilege of producing a show that has captivated South Africans and international audiences is one that warms my heart every day - especially when I think of my very first day as a young presenter on Top Billing. We are very grateful to the SABC for the opportunities the show has given us to discover new talent and to grow new stars while celebrating excellence, recognising achievements and contributing to a positive vision of South Africa and its people. We celebrate the legacy that Top Billing has created and the strength of the brand as a household name that defines the best of the good life and making dreams come true.” I am truly proud of the role Top Billing has played and the impact it has made on the South African entertainment space. The show exemplifies excellence and sophistication in arts, design, décor, fashion and broadcasting, creating countless jobs and building careers in its many years on air. It has been quite a ride and it is fitting that after 25 years we salute this season as our final one. Every show has a beginning and an end and reaching a quarter of a century for any production is one great feat. Thank you South Africa for allowing us in your homes for 25 years. Sending the love right back. ♥️��♥️�� Join me & my family for the last episode on Saturday at 6pm.A post shared by  Basetsana Kumalo (@basetsanakumalo) on Oct 17, 2019 at 12:50am PDTIt is believed that the poor ratings Top Billing has garnered – since it was moved from a midweek spot to Saturday – may have motivated the broadcaster’s decision.Many South Africans have reacted to the news on Twitter sharing their memories of the show and how it inspired them.
