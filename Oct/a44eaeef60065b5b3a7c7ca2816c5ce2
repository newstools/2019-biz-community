Dale Tomlinson, founder and CEO of The Hardy Boys, recalls the day the journey started in 1994, a significant year in South Africa. “Sheesh, what a rollercoaster it has been. I remember being told by the naysayers that I would never build an agency of any scale or significance in Durban. Who could not rise to a challenge like that! Clearly, we proved them wrong. The Hardy Boys took its name from the detective books by Franklin W Dixon in which brothers Frank and Joe Hardy were called in to use their unique brand of curiosity to solve problems. That is what we have been doing for the last 25 years, and like Frank and Joe we are never too proud to collaborate with other likeminded people to help us crack the case.” From a passionate team of five The Hardy Boys is now a part of global agency WundermanThompson which is one of the largest agency groups in the WPP Worldwide network. To kick off the ’25 Acts of Kindness’ campaign, THB partnered with the Do More Foundation for World Food Day (16 October 2019) helping to raise awareness around food insecurity and assisting with their aim of breaking the world record of most sandwiches made in one hour. The record was broken with THB contributing 2,400 of the 107,418 sandwiches made, smashing the current record of 57,000. All sandwiches were donated to local beneficiaries. “This is just the start of our mission, we look forward to collaborating with our clients and partners to bring a bit of joy to our local communities in the months ahead,” said Chief Creative Officer Geoff Paton.
