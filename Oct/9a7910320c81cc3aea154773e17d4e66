At the end of each game, the tool automatically creates a unique banner featuring the game’s score and then immediately hijacks the heated Twitter football conversation in real time. Fans are then led to the ‘Bouquets for Bros’ page where they can choose from 20 individually designed and colour-coded commiseration arrangements to send to their mates, to really rub their noses in it.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/518891-625x357.png" alt="NetFlorist and HelloFCB+ gets guys to send flowers to their mates" width="625" height="357">“Guys tend to show affection for one another through banter and ‘dissing’. So, we figured, what better way to do this than by getting them to send each other huge bunches of flowers to say how sorry you are for their loss, not!” said Chief Creative Officer, Mike Barnwell. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/518892-625x357.png" alt="NetFlorist and HelloFCB+ gets guys to send flowers to their mates" width="625" height="357">The offbeat campaign is set to run throughout the full Premier League season, featuring all 380 matches, giving guys ample opportunity to let their mates know how they really feel.
