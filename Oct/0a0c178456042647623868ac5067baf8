This ensures the right video marketing mix strategy.Often we’ll start a video-creation process, and the client will come to us and tell us what type of video they want to make.This usually goes something like: Can we have a brand video that drives traffic to our site and also lives on our site and generates leads. Can it also be used at presentations as well as being useable as a television commercial? Can it take into account mobile screens while giving us a voice on social media? Can you make us one video that does all this?In a nutshell, the client has asked for every video in the world that achieves every business and brand goal. Wrapped into one all-conquering piece of moving picture content. Simply put, it proves the power of the medium of video.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519005-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Vanilla Bear Films on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Video, the new document: Where do you start?A lot of people don't know where to begin with video in today's digital space...By Travis Bussiahn 1 Oct 2019When imagined by the visionary, it is the answer to all problems.

Taboola, Youtube, LinkedIn, Teads, Facebook, Instagram – they all want your video spend. Few businesses have the budget to get onto them all at once. And then there's still the matter of your supplementary video.That is the video that will live on your website and in your presentations. There's a lot of video to make and a lot of places to put them.My advice is to stop looking for your single silver bullet video. Start looking for your progressive video strategy. Video to feed the strategy, and a spend-model to bring you the balance between production and seeding.But get into the video game. It's fast, fun and it's the future. For now, at least.
