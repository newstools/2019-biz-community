But if you’re treating posters as commodity work, you could be overlooking chances to add value and increase your margin.Posters have been part of brand promotion for a long time, but their reach and visual impact mean they are still extremely effective and this shouldn’t be underestimated.Whether to entice a shopper to make an impulse purchase or to nudge a hotel guest to upgrade their stay or book a spa treatment, posters create awareness, hold attention and – importantly – measurably drive business.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475566-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#BizTrends2019: The revival of print" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: The revival of print"Print is dead" they said, "go digital" they said - we've heard the maxim time and time again and resultantly relegated print to the sidelines, we've left it feeling hapless and irrelevant...By Sam Swaine 14 Jan 2019Here are five ways you could make posters work harder for your customers and boost your business.1. Location, location, locationPosters can be very effective for promotion and wayfinding in a range of indoor and outdoor locations for almost any customer – from retailers to hospitality businesses, corporate clients and event organisers.Their versatility and cost-effectiveness make them an ideal choice, but location can play a critical role in how they perform as a promotional tool.Guide your customers on where to place posters to catch customers’ attention – whether that be in a busy travel hub or a cinema foyer, you can show them how to maximise visibility and increase response rates.And talk to them about the scope to introduce ‘hyper-local’ content that’s relevant to a specific location or street, to make their promotion even more relevant to a very closely targeted audience – for example, to catch the eye of commuters on a particular public transport route close to their business.2. Know your mediaThe range of printable large format media is growing all the time, delivering new performance benefits for you and your customers. It’s worth getting to know the latest products, as they might give you a point of difference with your next job.For example, a hospitality customer wants a short-term outdoor poster to drive footfall into their restaurant. Normally, you would have to laminate it to give it outdoor durability against wet weather.Alternative media choices could make a previously uneconomical job profitable, or give your finished posters the visual or performance ‘wow factor’ that converts a one-off client into a regular business. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/512971-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Bank Phrom on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">SA's economic slide tugs at print sales too but there's cause for optimismRegardless of the sector of the print industry you're in, you won't win by engaging in price wars...By Chris de Beer 23 Aug 20193. Spell out the digital advantageDo your customers understand the digital print advantage when it comes to their promotional activity? Given the popularity of digital marketing, they may have discounted printed posters until now on grounds of economy or speed to market.It’s time to emphasise the commercial benefits to them of just-in-time print-on-demand. Explain that they can now produce even a handful of printed posters economically, with no wasted prints and no inventory to be stored.Show them how digital print means they could be fast to market, with their posters turned around within as little as 24 hours, and with variable content for each campaign location. And highlight how on-demand print gives them the creative flexibility to make late-stage adjustments to their poster copy, so their campaign messages can be up to the minute.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1808/452401-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Ian Mackenzie is ECD at Canada's FCB Six and this year's Loeries ‘integrated campaign’, ‘print and out of home (OOH)’ and ‘print and out of home crafts’ jury president." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2018: "Don't get stuck in your advertising filter bubble" - Ian MackenzieIt's finally Loeries Creative Week 2018!

Talk about return on investment (ROI)Within a multi-channel marketing campaign, posters can be very effective at spiking interest and prompting consumers to interact with digital content to access more information or even make an online purchase.And this bridge to digital communication channels means that your customers can now track and measure their return on investment from a particular element of the campaign, even down to the individual poster.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511215.jpg" alt="BMi Research introduces improved features to print ads app" width="120" height="120">BMi Research introduces improved features to print ads appBMi Research has announced improvements and upgrades to its print promo ad tracker making the app even more user friendly...Issued by BMi Research 13 Aug 2019Implementing this doesn’t have to be particularly high tech – for example, adding a QR code to a printed poster enables the person viewing it to scan the code using their mobile phone and go straight to an online landing page.Or a localised promotional code can be included with the call to action, to be used at the online checkout or in a text response – helping the brand owner to see which poster locations or creative executions performed best.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513448.jpg" alt="Slick coding for primary packaging" width="120" height="120">Slick coding for primary packagingFor end-of-line packaging operations, efficient coding and labelling equipment is essential - no code means no product...Issued by Pyrotec 26 Aug 2019These are two very practical campaign tracking tools that are easy for customers to implement today, moving posters firmly into the category of ‘measurable marketing’.5. Beyond promotionIt’s worth remembering that posters aren’t only for promotion. For professional photographers and artists, for example, high-quality digital poster prints are a way of monetising their creative work by making it available for purchase. And for personal customers, posters are a popular choice for fine art or large-scale personal photo prints for their home.With the appropriate business model and the right photo quality printer, these are potential revenue streams that might be worth thinking about.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/518745.jpg" alt="Unusual and efficient guerilla marketing moves and ideas" width="120" height="120">Unusual and efficient guerilla marketing moves and ideasGuerilla marketing may help you if you are courageous enough.
