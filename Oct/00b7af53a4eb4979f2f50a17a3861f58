We fully subscribe to the Springboks’ slogan that we are #StrongerTogether and will support Siya and the boys to the end,” said Basson. The News24 logo will change to green in the days counting down to the final on Saturday 2 November, featuring the Springbok in the home page mastheads of News24 app, mobile web and desktop platforms. The dedicated Rugby World Cup hub across all three News24 platforms will keep readers updated on the final match build up, analysis and live scoring. News24 reaches an average of 1m daily unique browsers across platforms expecting to far exceed this reach during the build up to Saturday’s final match. Go Bokke!
