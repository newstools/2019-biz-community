It is also expected to appeal to a younger generation without alienating existing customers as the discounter targets new consumer segments while building on this brand loyalty.Still thinking pinkDespite the updated positioning, Game will hold on to its bold pink colour – introduced when the first store opened in Durban in 1970 – in pride of place.The refresh aims to assist in rebuilding its ‘rebel’ brand identity.“Game is most well-known for large appliances, electronics and home entertainment. What it needs to be recognised again for is liquor, groceries, pet products, luggage, toys and all things baby. We need to resurface how excellent we are in these categories,” adds Madley. Get Game-ingThe new pay-off line – ‘You’ve Got Game’ is an update on the founding sentiment that ‘You always win at Game’. “It’s inclusive. It’s a quintessential insight on the everyday swagger that South Africans have. And it’s indicative of the brand and the brand’s personality and nature. It embraces challenge and fulfils it. It’s almost a challenge to all of us to have Game, because when You’ve Got Game, then Game’s Got You,” says Madley. Game was founded in 1970 by Jack Schaeffer and Alan Hellmann, who wanted to put the fun back into what had become a tedious chore. Shopping, they believed, should be a game.
