Leading by example with an almost fatherly affection, Rademan is 100% hands-on, available at any time to support any member of the team to achieve personal or professional goals. He makes it his mission in life to ensure Biz people have the tools and flexibility they need to get on with the job of serving daily news to South Africa’s business communities.His approach has earned him respect, empowering each member of the team with the freedom to grow and create their own working style, creating an inclusive team environment which shows concern for everyone’s well-being.A unique atmosphere of trust and safety pervades Bizcommunity offices. Rademan’s ready praise and constructive guidance has helped create a culture of transparency and inclusivity from which the whole team benefits.Like the best managers, Rademan believes his team is capable of the best, with instinctive insights into the role each member of the team needs to play in meeting the daily needs of the South African business media.On this Bosses Day, we take the opportunity to express our gratitude for the warm family culture which Rademan has created within the Biz company, and which may be said to be largely responsible for the team's ability to continue to accomplish great things on a daily basis.
