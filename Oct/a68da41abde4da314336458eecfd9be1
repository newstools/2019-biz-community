She also announced yesterday that she would begin a hunger strike to protest her abuse, her lawyers’ Facebook posts said.The Tahrir News website is the online version of the al-Tahrir newspaper; the website has been blocked throughout the country since May, according to CPJ reporting and a Tahrir News staffer who confirmed today that the website is still blocked but asked not to be named, saying they were not authorized to speak on the issue. With its website inaccessible in Egypt, the outlet is facing financial insolvency, according to CPJ’s reporting.Abdel Fattah is a blogger and activist who has written about human rights and opposition groups at the outlet, and Egyptian authorities have surveilled her and banned her from leaving the country since 2016, as CPJ reported at the time.The day before her arrest, Abdel Fattah wrote a post on her Twitter account, which has since been suspended, supporting the release of opinion writers who have been imprisoned since protests began in Egypt last month, according to news reports.CPJ emailed the Egyptian public prosecutor’s office for comment on Abdel Fattah’s arrest and abuse allegations, but did not immediately receive a response. Today, pro-government media outlets such as Baladna and Akhbar al-Youm accused Abdel Fattah of lying about the torture and described her as an “agent of chaos for the Muslim Brotherhood.”Abdel Fattah is one of at least seven journalists arrested in Egypt amid anti-government protests that began on September 19, according to CPJ reporting.
