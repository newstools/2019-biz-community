The new Wimpy toasted cheeseburger TV commercial captures this difficulty perfectly. This ad shows a woman on two separate dates with two men, on different occasions at Wimpy where the conversations are played back-to-back. It turns out that she shares common interests with both of them. When it’s time to order food, she is faced with the tough decision of choosing between a toasted cheese sandwich or a burger. That’s when Wimpy’s new toasted cheeseburger enters and becomes the best decision this case.Unlike the belief that we don’t always get what we want, Wimpy turns this thinking around and gives the customer the best of two choices.
