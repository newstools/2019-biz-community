This format is equally suited for top of the funnel brand ads as well as conversion and lead generation campaigns," adds Craig Nicholson, Sales Director at The SpaceStation. The technology behind SpaceStation Stories also allows for increased trackability, interaction and engagement metrics. By combining these metrics, it becomes very easy to measure the success of the campaign beyond the click. SpaceStation Stories are now available in mobile and app across the 24.com verticals.
