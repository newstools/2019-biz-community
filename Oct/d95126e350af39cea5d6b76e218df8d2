Pete Case, Ogilvy Chief Creative Officer comments, “We are incredibly pleased to see the hard work of our clients and teams be rewarded at such a high level. We’re especially proud to win for a campaign that generated the most revenue in South Africa this year, alongside three best in-category wins for Mobile, Social and Influencer Marketing. Large congratulations also go to our partner Vodacom, who were crowned overall Social and Digital Corporate of the Year at the event.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/521042-625x207.jpg" alt="Ogilvy strikes gold at the New Generation Awards" width="625" height="207">Lana Strydom, Head of Digital, Social and Content Marketing at Vodacom, adds, “We have partnered with Ogilvy over the last five years to drive a digital first agenda, which has led to the delivery of exceptional work driving real business benefits. So we are delighted with the results at the New Generation awards this year.” Alistair Mokoena, Ogilvy CEO, adds, "As an agency that deeply believes in the power of digital and as current agency of the year at The Bookmarks, these wins help to further underline our deep skills in the modern marketing space. Over the last five years, we’ve invested heavily in the connection between data, technology and Consumer – as we firmly believe that this will drive the connection with both today and tomorrow's consumers." Case continues, "Today's digitally enabled consumer is simply a reality of our evolving audience and so at Ogilvy, we see digital as central to the increasingly complex integrated marketing space, where we treat all media in one agnostic approach. So whilst it’s a shame that our industry still requires standalone award shows to promote and celebrate digital, we’re very proud of these achievements. And thank you to the judges for selecting our work as the benchmark for cut-through marketing in these categories." Rochelle Knock, Executive Head of Customer Value Management at Multichoice, also a big winner on the night, concludes, “Winning these awards is a great honour and encourages the team and our agency partners to continue doing our best work. We are constantly striving to drive excellence in social and digital marketing. Our winning work this year outperformed our expectations and campaign objectives, including a 12% increase in our audience, powered directly by the great content of this exciting campaign.” 2019 New Generation awards results: Best Revenue Generating Marketing Campaign or EventGold Winner – Vodacom South Africa - Team Red, Vodacom Video TicketGold Winner – Vodacom South Africa - Team Red, Summer GigsBest Online CompetitionGold Winner – Vodacom South Africa - Team Red, Vodacom Super ProposalMobile Marketing ExcellenceGold Winner – Mobile Marketing Excellence, Vodacom South Africa - Team Red, Vodacom Summer 2018 – Summer GigsGold Winner – Vodacom South Africa - Team Red, Vodacom Super ProposalMost Innovative Use of Social Media by a CorporateGold Winner – DStv – Ogilvy South Africa, Africa UnitedBest Influencer Marketing Campaign by an AgencySilver Winner – Ogilvy South Africa – DStv, Africa UnitedThe New Generation Overall Social & Digital Corporate of the Year AwardGold Winner – Vodacom South Africa
