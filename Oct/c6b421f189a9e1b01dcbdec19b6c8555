A Walker study found that by 2020, customer experience will overtake price and product as the key brand differentiator.To survive today’s competitive environment, companies need to become customer-centric placing focus on customer intimacy. This is where companies can set themselves apart from their competition, by going the extra mile in the customer journey, past the point-of-sale. Instead of thinking how much I can sell to this customer, companies need to think how can I best meet the customers’ needs and wants by tailoring products or services accordingly, adding extra value to their customers' businesses.Yet, too often companies still experience a disconnect, where they tout the latest design or technology but have not placed any focus on the meaningful aspects of customer engagement.

Not to mention, see growth. Understanding your customers Companies need to take a step back and determine who exactly are their customers, which industries they operate in, and identify the main drivers within those industries.In fact, according to PwC’s Global Consumer Insights Survey 2019, customers share behavioural and attitudinal attributes across different industries. So, overlaying these traits with demographics can help companies yield a more richly detailed customer profile than looking at demographics alone. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/508605-120x120.jpg?2" alt="5 ways to drive growth through customer retention" width="120" height="120">5 ways to drive growth through customer retentionBusinesses have become obsessed with their growth curve, regardless of the metric, number of users, customers and followers growth...By Kirsty Sharman 25 Jul 2019Understanding customers challengesWhen embarking on the customer engagement journey, companies must always look at things from a customer viewpoint, understanding what their challenges are and then re-engineering everything back.For companies to truly understand their customers, they need to understand both their macro and micro-challenges.
