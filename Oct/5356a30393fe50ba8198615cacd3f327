It starts off in an uncomfortable way as we watch scenes unfold in which a man spikes a woman’s drink in a bar while her back is turned, while another male gives a female co-worker an unrequested shoulder rub, with the males thanking the viewer for not speaking out. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1807/448642-120x120.jpg?2" alt="When is #MeToo coming to my workplace? 8 things you can do now" width="120" height="120">When is #MeToo coming to my workplace? 8 things you can do nowAs a sociologist who studies feminist activism, I often get asked when and how the #MeToo movement is going to trickle down...By Judith Taylor 12 Jul 2018The tables are turned in the second half of the ad, where the females also break the fourth wall and thank the viewer for reporting the various acts. “When you do nothing, you’re helping him. But when you do something, you help her.”The ‘stop sexual violence and harassment when you see it’ public education campaign was paid for by the government of Ontario and created by Canada’s Lyfeblood.com, GCOM Radio and DS Ent. The synopsis on YouTube reads: “This is a short ad on male sexual violence against women. This ad campaign started by Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne to inform and educate people on what is "not OK" when dealing [with] sexual aggression from some males in our society.”Call out bad behaviour - anywhere, anytimeThe message hits home, though most of the overseas commenters at the time found it sexist. In response, Fran Ballan wrote:I can understand guys getting defensive about how all the predators in this video are male. However, don't let the general message be lost on you. We can't let abusers hurt anyone at any time. They are the true enemy. They divide men and women, so that the fingers are pointed elsewhere and not at the real perpetrators. There should be at least one female harasser in this video, so that young men aren't alienated and the message stands.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515326.jpg" alt="From #MeToo to #AmINext: How to address gender-based sexual violence in the workplace" width="120" height="120">From #MeToo to #AmINext: How to address gender-based sexual violence in the workplaceEarlier this week, #AmINext flooded social media as women in South Africa drew attention to the magnitude of gender-based sexual violence, rape and murder taking place throughout the country...By Nadine Mather and Lusanda Raphulu 5 Sep 2019That’s the point that sticks with me.The Ontario newsroom confirms that the ad went on to win four new awards from Strategy Magazine, including their inaugural Grand Prix award, for the ad's ability to, "maximise awareness and inspire conversation."<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515505-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Trending images relating to the #AmINext hashtag and the much-shared pic of the protest march outside Parliament on 5 September 2019: ." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Stepping up to keep SA's females safeLocal media covered the general sense of unrest and discomfort in the country last week, following the spate of femicide cases that spurred the nation to say #Enoughisenough and ask #AmInext?

A column by Melanie Verwoerd on News24 further brings the impact of this 'speak out' message home.Verwoerd speaks of the need to call out and fight “the obvious and insidious ways in which degrading women is part of our language, enshrined in the division of roles in the home and work place and yes, even in our music.” It’s not about placing blame, but rather about taking action.

It’s about putting fairness first.
