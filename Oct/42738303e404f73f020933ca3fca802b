We created a digital campaign heroed by video content pieces showcasing strangers sharing personal items that should remain private. From toothbrushes, to gym towels and even underwear, we wanted to highlight the "discomfort" one should feel at the thought of sharing private "things" and how the same should apply to sharing confidential information.Our digital strategy was to drive as much engagement as possible through focused social media ad platforms. These platforms included Instagram stories, Facebook in-stream video and Ad Colony cards, which is an interactive ad where users could engage with a fun game of "Would you rather".<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/523902-625x540.jpg" alt="Fighting banking crime, one share at a time" width="625" height="540">All content pieces guided our audience to an interactive microsite where they could further their knowledge of cybercrimes and learn what kind of scams they're likely to encounter and how to avoid them.Visit www.chooseyourendgame.co.za to view the microsite.Client: SABRICCreative Agency: So InteractiveDigital Director: Darren MansourAccount Manager: Michelle MarderCreative Director: Letitia LermArt Director: Nicole EllisProduction: Neo LegodiCopywriter: Tamlyn WilsonProduction Company: Run Jump Fly CreationsDirectors: Lourens Smit & Tristan Coetzee Producer: Devin ArmstrongEditor: Lourens SmitDOP: Chuanne BlofieldHair: Lyn KennedyMakeup: Tamaryn PretoriusGrip: Henry BlignautStyling: Melissa Maxted-HendersonAnimation: Matchfire MotionAbout So InteractiveSo Interactive is a creative agency that delivers digital-first marketing experiences and products that drive business results.
