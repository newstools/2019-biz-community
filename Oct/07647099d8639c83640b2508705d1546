For example, many people are surprised to find out that two-thirds of its local users are aged 18-34 and that only 21% fall into the 13-17 age group.Its users are not interested in curating perfect posts and pics, but in creating fast, sharable, in-the-moment content.

These platforms and their media assets are still around, reaching around seven million local users with more than 290 million page views each month. Verizon Media is the programmatic platform one uses to access this audience.The strength of this platform is its emphasis on native ad formats rather than on standard display formats.
