“What keeps the work consistently good is that we hunt story,” says FirstPencil’s director Justine Puren-Calverley. Whether it's about a blind gran, the data of a city or just creating a full character to slot into a vignette, FirstPencil’s philosophy is that people will always watch good stories.And the theory has been proven, with the result of three of the production company’s ads on Kantar’s best loves ads (Q1 & Q2) in 2019.As rated by South African consumers, the three ads included in the results were:1. Future Life - “...is the future of breakfast” – Ranked 6th in Q1 of 2019FirstPencil teamed up with OFyt and worked with 14 kids, 7 adults, a dog and a cat on the Future Life ad.FUTURELIFE_30SEC_DIRECTOR_2019_02_18_LARGE from Justine Puren Calverley on Vimeo.Agency: OFytChris Gotz, Executive Creative DirectorTania Barker, Creative DirectorAli Coetzee, Agency ProducerProduction House: FirstPencilDirector Justine Puren-CalverleyDOP, Pierre de VilliersArt Director, Kezia EalesPost Production StrangeloveEditor, Emily BussacGrade, Nic ApostoliOnline, Charmaine Greyling2.
