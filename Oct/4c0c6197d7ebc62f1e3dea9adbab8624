Countries around the world depend on stock markets for economic growth.Before the integrated and technology-based systems stock exchanges of today, and before investors used to yell across trade floors and throw order forms into the air, they conducted business in coffee shops. Early stocks were handwritten on sheets of paper, and investors traded these stocks with other investors in coffee shops.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507865.jpg" alt="How to thrive in the digital era: the human touch" width="120" height="120">How to thrive in the digital era: the human touchI don't believe anyone will deny that we are in the midst of digital disruption - or that businesses that embrace technology will benefit, while those who do not will lag behind...By Jeanette Marais 22 Jul 2019Now doesn’t that sound a lot like how we traded advertising?Advertising has pretty much been traded like Pty Ltd stocks. Each Pty Ltd (media owner) looks to offset its stock (ad inventory) to willing investors (advertisers/agencies) through a personally negotiated trade. The media owner pushing the valuation of its ad inventory over the rest of the market, whilst the advertiser/agency looks for best buy against other opportunities presented by the market. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/509048-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Aaron Sebastian on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Is it premium versus programmatic or premium and programmatic?The media landscape is changing rapidly and the way that media agencies are planning and buying digital media is ever-evolving...By Mark Botha 29 Jul 2019Like trading Pty Ltd stocks, the process is prohibitive:Sellers can reach only a limited number of prospective buyers, and, similarly, buyers can engage only a limited number of sellersSellers define product value in isolation and probably mostly based on biased business return requirements (sell high), and, similarly, buyers evaluate product value in isolation (no idea what same product was offered to competitors at) and probably mostly based on biased business procurement requirements (buy low)Net results for both sides:protracted negotiationscumbersome processesfragmented sales/procurement processesfair value doubtpotential opportunities missedUnless, of course, you had superhuman sales reps, absolute superior products and lacked fierce competition, or had more in-market clout than anyone else. Then, of course, as Pty Ltd (media owner) it was plain sailing. And the same applies to investors (advertisers/agencies), if you had superior procurement processes and controlled significant budgets, then it was easy pickings.But it hardly ever is, and with the changes in the media landscape, those limiting conditions have all but been eroded. Yes, digital disruption has played a part – it’s shifted media consumption – international platforms have muscled in on the clout of historic big in-market players. But it’s ad exchanges that are playing the most significant part in enabling investments to follow consumption. It makes buying and selling easier. Just as stock exchanges have done equities.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/516260-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Marketing the future: Unlocking the human element in a digital world" width="120" height="120">Marketing the future: Unlocking the human element in a digital worldA data science expert, mind science practitioner and advertising strategist walk into a bar...

It’s a well-known anecdote in traditional media: “Whoever owns distribution, owns the market.” <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496618-120x120.jpg" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty." width="120" height="120">How African countries are doing in ballooning digital music revenuesWhile new modes of distribution using mobile telecommunications networks offer real alternatives to piracy, African musicians continue to struggle to reap significant benefits...By Christiaan De Beukelaer and Andrew J. Eisenberg 14 May 2019Think large newspaper and magazine publishers “owning” retail outlets or premium shelf space in those retailers – how does a small publisher compete? Think satellite TV broadcast licensing, if you have the licence, you control signal distribution.The internet facilitates the immediate distribution of content; a severe disruption to the news and media industry, with significant knock-on disruption to the advertising industry. Ad exchanges facilitate distribution of ad inventory, instantaneously, at enormous scale.          View this post on Instagram           Watch this! In 7 years tech changed everything.
