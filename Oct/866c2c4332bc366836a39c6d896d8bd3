The irony is that with all the customer data that marketers use to personalise, the one thing they seem to have forgotten to find out from consumers is whether they even want personalised communication at all, the firm writes.Combined with identity resolution and increased automation, companies have created adtech and martech stacks that are creeping people out. We think our phones are listening to us. And then Facebook admits it is doing this. So, what’s gone wrong? SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504626-120x120.jpg?2" alt="SA marketers, show us your content smarts!" width="120" height="120">SA marketers, show us your content smarts!Content marketing does not come easy. It is a long-term investment that requires marketers to move from thinking like brand champions to thinking like publishers. So, get ready to change gears!...By Louisa Douwes Dekker 2 Jul 2019The report by Melissa Parrish, Forrester’s VP and group director serving marketing professionals, highlights that marketers are ignoring their customers’ desire for anonymity, by assuming that they all want personalised experiences. They are foregoing the authenticity of their own brands by “giving lip service to brand values they think resonate with customers.”There’s an overt focus on martech at the expense of human creativity. Lastly, they’re profiling customers on precarious connections and getting it wrong, sometimes with harmful and even traumatic results, she explains.The solution is to return to true customer-centricity by going back to basics by looking at the following, Parrish writes in the report:Remember that customers are different. Here it’s not about customer segments or personas, but rather the extent to which they expect you to know them. Treat customers and prospects differently – prospects “want value, not a background check”Customers are tired of lookalike ads and direct mail that is poorly personalised, trying to get them to buy things for which they’re not even in the market. Choose your target audience, focus on them and then let go of the othersProgrammatic marketing has its upsides and downsides. Avoid the two extremes of advertising at scale across multiple channels on the one hand and limiting advertising to channels where everyone seems to be at once, such as Facebook, on the other. Instead, target your audience with responsible content and choose platforms on which you can reach them online and offlineConsider whether you should be using cookie, key-stroke and audience data at all for your brand. Intent-based target marketing through search optimisation might be a smarter choiceDon’t assume that personalisation will make customer experiences more relevant. Rather interview your customers and test different variations of personalised content to find the right balance between information, recommendations, simplicity and empathyDon’t ignore the 20% who don’t want any personalisation at all – use your customer insights data to identify them and then meet their expectation of no personalisationSOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/514842.jpg" alt="The age of the artificial; the proliferation of 'fake'" width="120" height="120">The age of the artificial; the proliferation of 'fake'A threat to democracy, discourse, to truth; 'fake news' has become the buzzword of the last few years...By Molly Fitz-Patrick, Issued by Red & Yellow 3 Sep 2019Parrish offers important recommendations for the winning marketers of the future. Since the success of marketing is measured by the bottom line of revenue generation, truly customer-obsessed marketers need KPIs that are “fine-tuned” to understand what customers value, not what’s valuable to the brand, she writes.What customers want and value should be defined in terms of four dimensions along the axes of functional-experiential and economic-symbolic. Then, measure the dimensions along the entire customer life cycle, she explains.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/514079-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Luke Chesser on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">3 data trends shaping digital marketing in the next 18 monthsDatacore Media MD Grant Lapping outlines three data-related trends that will change the game for brands over the next year to 18 months...By Grant Lapping 30 Aug 2019What this requires is the following:Firstly, marketing and customer experience (CX) teams need to unify and leverage one another’s unique skills to deliver best-in-class customer experiences that drive loyalty, customer retention and growth. Truly customer-obsessed brands will bring CX and marketing together to harness the best that both have to offerSecondly, brands need to rebuild trust. As consumers become more privacy-savvy, they will become more selective about the brands with which they are willing to share their data. Marketers need to develop ‘privacy personas’ as a new marketing segment to ensure that they deliver experiences their customers are comfortable withThirdly, refocus on creative excellence. In Parrish’s words “new prospecting strategies will centre on great creative – making an emotional impact and contextual targeting driving relevance”Lastly, marketers need to find ways to extend customer obsession throughout the enterprise. Employees need to be empowered to deliver on the brand promise, which must align to and be in harmony with CXThe companies that thrive will be those whose CX truly reflects brand values, Parrish concludes.
