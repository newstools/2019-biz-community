During this event, the talking points were around promoting social marketing for good, what it means and how corporates and society can come together to effect change and make social causes more meaningful and most importantly, impactful: The attendees that sat on the panel were Owen Manda, Director of Public Affairs at Ipsos South Africa, Themba Rumbu, an online Social Activist aspiring Social entrepreneur, and Kwambele’s CEO, Tshidi Modikoane Mbele. Tshidi opened up the discussion with her gripping presentation on how the spirit of coming together as a nation is evident through and through when it comes to sporting events and yet that same spirit lacks much conviction when it comes to social impact. Although there are examples of this spirit in smaller pockets socially, led by unapologetic youth who want to see change and social justice i.e. the #FeesMustFall movement and the Rhodes #RUreferencelist. Owen gave insight to how corporates should meaningfully invest in social programmes rather than just making it a box-ticking exercise for governance and Themba spoke to the importance of driving socially-fuelled conversations online with the purpose of drawing insight on how to effect change on the ground.The event was a success overall with much knowledge and insight shared and a quote from the CEO before her parting words were: "It’s clear that the time is now, the climate is right for us to create massive change within our companies, communities and the country at large."www.kwambele.co.za
