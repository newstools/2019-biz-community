At DAN we start with our client’s challenge and provide a holistic solution across our business focusing on being ideas-led, tech-enabled and data-driven. In this three-part series we will demonstrate how Posterscope is utilising these pillars across our business. Posterscope are leading location specialists. Our approach to out-of-home is data-driven and tech-enabled. Posterscope is the world’s leading location-based marketing specialist and as the biggest out-of-home specialist agency in South Africa we have always invested in data and platforms to ensure that we remain leaders within the out-of-home industry. This investment in data and platforms allows us to drive accuracy and excellence across our business, enabling us to provide exceptional solutions for our clients. ECOS Posterscope’s global propriety platform ECOS is an end-to-end campaign management platform with a range of applications designed to support and enhance business activity. ECOS is the most advanced OOH mapping and planning platform on our continent and has successfully been implemented with Posterscope teams in South Africa, Kenya, Nigeria and Ghana. It is the foundation on which Posterscope’s Location Speciality offering is built on. It has enabled us to be data-driven and automated in our media planning and buying process. Using ECOS to bring data to life In a recent article on the CapeTown ETC website from February 2019 titled “Capetonians lose almost a week in traffic each year”, the following statistics were shared: “A Global Traffic Scorecard by INRIX analyses the traffic congestion and mobility trends in more than 200 cities across 38 countries, delivering in-depth insights for drivers and producing a chart of cross-national rankings. Cape Town ranked 28th on the index, which shows a staggering statistic: according to the scorecard, the average Capetonian spends a massive 162 hours each year sitting in traffic, the equivalent of nearly a week.” We decided to put ECOS to the test to see where this congestion is occurring in our City, which areas are experiencing this congestion the most and during which times of day. Using Google Maps traffic data, which is determined by using location services data across smartphone devices, anonymous data points are sent back to Google Maps to analyse the number of vehicles and how fast vehicles are travelling. Essentially this is the representation of consumers with smartphones across a country’s roads.This data is seamlessly integrated within ECOS, see below traffic patterns for Cape Town during peak traffic hours on a weekday from 3-6pm.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/523284.gif" alt="Part 1: One Dentsu - Tech-enabled" width="600" height="338">The ability to interpret commuter movements and traffic patterns means that we can use this understanding to inform OOH to be more targeted. The exciting part is that traffic data is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what location and other data sources, we are able to ingest and bring to life through this industry-leading platform ECOS.
