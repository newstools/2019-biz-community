Most importantly, organisations need to be able to curate content that is relatable to their desired target audience. People pay attention to what speaks to them, which is why the channels that organisations use to deliver their message is vital. Communication is the key to all strong, healthy and productive relationships, including professional relationships. The way something is communicated is as important as what is being communicated. The sort of strategy that the business chooses to communicate varies greatly depending on the message, audience and the goals. Therefore, choosing the appropriate communication tool would require answering the following three W’s: WHO (the audience), WHAT (the message), and WHY (goals/objectives). <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/521983-625x417.jpg" alt="Communication is at the heart of business success" width="625" height="417">There are various platforms and mediums that companies could explore to distribute their message to employees.
