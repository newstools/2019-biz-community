They search, browse and research products online and make purchasing decisions before they have even walked into a store. In some instances, with instant access to the internet via smartphones, they compare products and prices in-store before making final purchasing decisions. Customers also aren’t limited to trading hours or geographical boundaries as online and mobile shopping presents a convenient alternative to spending time in stores. They can find the brands they are looking for and make purchases instantaneously without the hassle of shopping around first and standing in queues. This is supported by research from Nielsen – which states that 30% of global retail sales will be made through an app or software by 2020.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/499356-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The customer experience drives digital disruption" width="120" height="120">The customer experience drives digital disruptionDigitisation has revolutionised the way businesses operate, with new entrants into all markets disrupting traditional enterprises through entirely innovative models...By Vishal Barapatre 30 May 2019Using data to make decisionsTechnology isn’t only available to consumers. Brands should be using technology to improve customer engagements and drive brand loyalty. This can be achieved by starting with the data. For years, companies have collected customer data, now they have technologies to analyse the data and make informed business decisions.Starbucks, for example, has implemented technology that enables it to instantly track and aggregate sales and other data to determine which products are the most popular with customers and understand when and where customers are making purchases. This data is then used to determine which new offerings it should introduce according to customer preferences.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507482-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Harness potential of data-driven tech to keep customers happy" width="120" height="120">Harness potential of data-driven tech to keep customers happyInvestment in technology and analytics is a must if business is going to meet rising customer expectations.

Meaning that they are measuring the return on experience based on how customers interact with their brand and how employee experience contributes to the overall experience.Technology solutions can help empower employees to exceed customer’s expectations by automating repetitive tasks that are time intensive. For example, customer statements could be automated, while more intensive customer queries could be handled by employees that no longer need to search for statements for clients.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/504153.jpg" alt="Creating competitive advantage through CX" width="120" height="120">Creating competitive advantage through CXGlobally, the shift towards automation is being driven by the need to increase agility and provide customers with a greater sense of immediacy...By Derek Bose 28 Jun 2019PersonalisationHuman interaction is a key factor that will differentiate brands from other offerings on the market. While technology can be used to change the way brands work, it cannot be used to establish relationships of trust with customers. As such, the most critical differentiator for customers will be the human touch. Technology and customer data work hand in hand to help deliver personalised experiences that meet customer’s needs.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/443770.jpg" alt="Four ways technology delivers a personalised retail customer experience" width="120" height="120">Four ways technology delivers a personalised retail customer experienceAcross the competitive landscape of the retail industry, we are starting to see a massive trend as retailers adopt more technological practices in order to enhance their customer experience...Issued by Interact RDT 6 Jun 2018Customers no longer want an SMS or email with their name on it, they want information that is relevant to them, they are looking for personalised experiences and they want to feel like companies know who they are and what they want based on their previous behaviour with the company. This means reaching them at a time that is most convenient or relevant to them with information that is specific to their needs rather than bombarding them with content that is designed for everyone. For example, if a customer purchases pizza every Wednesday, they should be targeted on a Wednesday with a special offer and a prompt – which suggests having the order ready for them at the usual time of collection rather than sending messages to them on other days with deals that aren’t relevant to them.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1808/454949-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Enhancing the in-store experience through personalisation" width="120" height="120">Enhancing the in-store experience through personalisationFor South African retailers, the ability to effectively utilise the data at their disposal using sophisticated technology will be fundamental to remaining competitive with personalised in-store customer experiences...By Gareth Hawkey 27 Aug 2018Weave technology into the brandWith tech-savvy customers, brands cannot afford not to embrace technology solutions as part of their offering. While traditionally companies needed to incorporate their core values and mission throughout the brand, today technology needs to be added to this mix.According to Sidney Harman, “the more technology is woven into your values, the more likely it is to be used wisely.”The wise use of technology is critical for businesses to succeed in today’s global market. No longer is technology a nice to have or can it be incorporated for technology sake. It has to meet the specific needs of customers. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/500974.png" alt="Accelerated growth sees Amazon crowned 2019's BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brand" width="120" height="120">Accelerated growth sees Amazon crowned 2019's BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global BrandWith little sign of a slowdown in growth, Amazon has become the world's most valuable brand, according to the 2019 BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands ranking released today...Issued by Kantar 11 Jun 2019As such, the customer should be at the centre of every business decision and determine which technologies are incorporated to streamline engagements and delight customers. Technology, which should serve as a competitive differentiator in aiding brands to provide a superior experience and connect with audiences, should integrate into existing systems to ensure that is it is easy to use and used regularly and effectively. To achieve this marketing and technology departments can no longer work as silos within an organisation. They need to sit at the boardroom table and make decisions together to develop solutions that ultimately enhance experiences and delight customers.
