Twice." width="265" height="300">With two ads in the top 10 most liked by South Africans, FoxP2 continues to win big love for some of SA’s biggest brand names, FNB and Wimpy. “It’s especially rewarding to see our work for big, complex retail clients continue to deliver the results these brands demand in both share of heart and share of wallet. It’s an honour to be entrusted with such significant brands,” said Grant Jacobsen, Executive Creative Director and Partner for FoxP2 South Africa. Zetu Damane, Head of Strategy FoxP2 Joburg, said: “It is wonderful to see consumers respond to our stories as we work extremely hard to ensure we use our deep data and insight to meaningfully connect with South African Consumers. Our partnership with the Dentsu Aegis Network, has allowed the FoxP2 team access to rich data sources both globally and locally such as the proprietary Consumer Connection System which is one of South Africa’s largest consumer surveys.” Integration of this immense data with true human insights enables the FoxP2 team to unlock genuinely powerful consumer insights and equally powerful work. Work that has now been recognised by consumers as well as Apex judges.“It’s incredible to see these big data stories become big wins for our clients. We’ve seen the results at Apex, and now we’re seeing the results where it really matters — our clients' customers,” said Grant Jacobsen. Jacques Cronje, Marketing Executive for Wimpy, said: “FoxP2 has been an instrumental partner in identifying and tapping into deep consumer insights that have enabled top-class creative being produced. This work has resonated with consumers who have immediately connected with the brand and who had an overwhelming positive response to the work done by the FoxP2 team.”
