DStv understands this and wants to keep viewers at the heart of everything they do. This is why they have partnered with the newlywed Somizi on a festive campaign that seeks to make homes across the country the place to be with DStv Compact this festive season.  “As Africa’s most loved storyteller and leaders in entertainment, there’s no better way to demonstrate that leadership than to officially ‘bula’ this festive season officially with Somizi whom we believe speaks to our DStv Compact mission of making homes the place to be,” says Thabisa Mkhwanazi, Executive Head of Marketing at DStv. “Our Compact customers are in for a real treat this festive season – look out for all the exciting ‘Bula Festive’ prizes and exciting content to delight new and existing customers this season.” “I am excited to be working with DStv once again on the all new Bula Festive campaign. Coming on board was a no brainer because the festive season is my favourite part of the year and now, I have an opportunity to make it special for everyone,” said Somizi. In the TV commercial for the campaign, which officially launched on Monday, 14 October 2019, Somgaga can be seen approaching people in the comfort of their homes and announcing that it is time to ‘Bula’ all things festive, all to the sounds of Thebe’s iconic party anthem, ‘Bulaboot’. The nationwide campaign will also see Somizi visit all corners of the country where he will interact with new DStv Compact subscribers at Bula Festive mall experiences throughout the festive season while new DStv Compact customers also stand a chance to win their share of R100,000! Shows coming to DStv Compact this festive season include brand new series Ifalakhe, the jaw dropping, never seen before story of raging kingdoms and Comedian Tol A$$ Mo and his designer wife Mome on the new reality show Mo and Mome.
