Amongst the exhibitors was Voortrekker Monument – the second most visited tourism destination in South Africa (Trip Advisor South Africa), Freedom Park, Xplore Tshwane, Mangwanani Spa as well as Dinokeng Game Reserve, the only residential Big Five game reserve in Gauteng.Olive Ndebele, General Manager of Menlyn Park Shopping Centre believes the Tourism Expo opened a host of opportunities for shoppers to discover the City of Tshwane in the best way possible, “We acknowledge that our shoppers are under increasing financial and economic pressures and that destination excursions can be challenging. So with this in mind, we wanted to create greater awareness for the local tourism offerings that deserve local support and show our shoppers that they can find great experiences located right here in their city at affordable rates”.Primedia Outdoor, the premier provider of out-of-home media solutions within sub Saharan Africa, exclusively sold exhibition stands to provide local entrepreneurs an ideal platform to display their respective attractions to shoppers. Jorja Wilkins, Marketing and Marketing Services Executive of Primedia Outdoor said, “It was important for us in partnership with Menlyn Park Shopping Centre and other significant partners to open a door for local businesses to give shoppers a preview of what they are about. Tourism is one of the world’s largest economy drivers and our local tourism businesses need to be put on the map in every possible way - and the expo did exactly that."Primedia Outdoor wishes to extend gratitude to Menlyn Park Shopping Centre, City of Tshwane, Tshwane Tourism Association, Tshwane community, exhibitors and everyone who was involved in making the expo a success.About Primedia OutdoorPrimedia Outdoor is the premier provider of out of home media solutions within Sub Saharan Africa.
