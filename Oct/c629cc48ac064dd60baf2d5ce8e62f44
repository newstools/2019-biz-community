You know: any spare moment, there we are, SnapBooking our WhatsFaces or adding likes to our tweet-zones...By James Holloway 23 Jul 2018I believe five of the major breakthroughs that changed phones and how we interact with them were: the launch of SMS; introduction of Blackberry Internet Service (BIS); the data evolution; Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) – allowing voice calls to be transmitted over the internet rather than phone lines; the rise of social media and apps; and the addition of value-added services (VAS) – services beyond standard voice calls. In the last few years, we’ve seen serious innovations. Let’s start with some facts on the first-ever mobile phone. It was made by Motorola in 1973, weighed 1.1kg, took 10 hours to charge and allowed for just 30 minutes of talk time.Happy #throwbackthursday !This is the Motorola DynaTEC 8000X - the worlds first commercially available cell phone. It is 35 years old.

The networkThe network plays a huge role and is the backbone to powering all devices. Without an efficient network, you can’t stream or use the device to its full capacity.Networks have undergone big changes since the first network launched commercially in 1983. 2G saw the integration of digital signals in cellular networks. 3G enabled the handling of broadband data, which allowed phones to process data-heavy apps, social networks and streaming. 4G is improving data bandwidth. 5G will facilitate even better connections and faster speeds than ever before.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1804/435641-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Mobile culture fertile ground for online retail growth" width="120" height="120">Mobile culture fertile ground for online retail growthSouth Africa has a population 56 million, but the number of cellphones in the country exceeds the number. 22.5 million of these mobile owners are online users and many of them shop online using their cellphones...5 Apr 2018How have our phones changed our day-to-day experiences of the world? Think about what you use your phone for in 2019. Your Google or Siri voice assistant answers any question you might have – including the time of your flight or the name of the hotel you’re checking into.Your running app tells you your heartbeat and tracks your route. Your top online shop enables you to virtually try on clothes. Your online learning portal loads up e-lectures. And your bank sends you push notifications telling you not to buy those sneaks you’re lusting over.

It also impacts employment. For example, more startups harness the power of technology to ‘matchmake’ employers with employees, to combat unemployment in South AfricaThere’s been a change in the entertainment landscape: A 2019 Hootsuite report shows South African cellphone owners spend an average of three hours and thirty minutes on the web each day, which is higher than the global average. In total, 40% of us have active social media accounts – WhatsApp and YouTube are the two most popular platforms – and 48% of us stream content onlineWe’re working differently: More and more people are operating out of office as businesses bring in flexi-time and work from home days.
