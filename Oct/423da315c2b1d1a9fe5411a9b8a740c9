Its Barcelona Principles, launched in 2010, created the first real framework for best practices in PR Measurement. Its main aim was to counter poor and discredited practices in use for decades such as Advertising Value Equivalents (AVEs) and PR multipliers with many professionals believing this to be a major threat to the credibility of Public Relations as a practice.AMEC members organise events across the world as part of AMEC’s Global Education Program and Measurement Month is filled with events including webinars, breakfast briefings, conferences, workshops, podcasts and much more, focusing on filling the gap between understanding the value of PR measurement and how to adopt best practices to make communication truly strategic.AMEC has created many free tools to educate the industry and operationalise new methodologies. Most recently 2019 has seen the introduction of the Measurement Maturity Mapper which is an online measurement tool to assist companies to map their own progress and to benchmark their own practices compared to peers. This detailed online questionnaire also offers advice on how to improve measurement based on the answers of respondents.Another great free resource is the Integrated Evaluation Framework which guides communicators through the best measurement practices process. Available in 21 languages – from English, French, Spanish, German and Russian through to Chinese and Arabic – it has seen great adoption across the globe as it demystifies best measurement and evaluation practices.Ornico, South African AMEC member, will host free Measurement Month breakfast workshops in Johannesburg highlighting the Barcelona Principles 2.0, The Integrated Evaluation Framework, the Measurement Maturity Mapper, global trends and will also feature various case studies of best practices from across the world.Francois van Dyk, Head of Operations at Ornico and AMEC International Board Director, believes great strides have been made globally to develop and implement better PR measurement practices. He however urges the African Public Relations industry to embrace the professionalising of better measurement and evaluation practices as not to fall behind the rest of the world.PRISA (The Public Relations Institute of South Africa) is also hosting a full day Measurement and Evaluation workshop during November 2019, also facilitated by Van Dyk.Communicators are encouraged to follow #AMECMM on social media during November 2019 to join thousands of global colleagues who are learning and working to better the public relations industry.Ornico Measurement and Evaluation Workshops: Friday, 15 November 2019, 8.30 – 10.30am Wednesday, 20 November 2019, 8.30 – 10.30amFor further information to attend the Ornico Johannesburg workshops please email: francoisv@ornicogroup.co.zabRev('brev-74db2fb3-e14f-4680-9d2a-5d24f9b621c4', '>a/\<az.oc.puorgocinro@vsiocnarf>"az.oc.puorgocinro;46#&vsiocnarf:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<') or call +27 11 8845041PRISA – Measurement and Evaluation WorkshopFriday, 8 November 2019, 8.30am – 4pmFor further information to attend the PRISA workshop please contact Annah Jordan (PRISA) at annah@prisa.co.zabRev('brev-f48a3784-eb26-418b-a2d7-164c2152b2b9', '>a/\<az.oc.asirp@hanna>"az.oc.asirp;46#&hanna:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<') or +27 67 008 8113.For more international event details, including webinars, please visit: https://amecorg.com/measurement-month-2019/
