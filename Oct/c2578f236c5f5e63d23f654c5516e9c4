Items available from Google feature a shopping cart icon in the company’s colour scheme.“Finally, whenever you buy on Google, we will also invest in clean energy projects to offset the carbon emissions created from shipping your order,” the company also revealed.Earlier this year, Google made a number of updates to benefit shopping through Google Images as well.
