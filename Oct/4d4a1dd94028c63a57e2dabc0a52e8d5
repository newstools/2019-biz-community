Where do you live, work and play?I live in Cape Town, on the slopes of Signal Hill, and work in Woodstock with the top-drawer people at HaveYouHeard. I play wherever my kids’ imagination takes us, on my guitars and piano, and with my friends online, where we pretend we’re the ultimate version of SEAL Team Six.2. What’s your claim to fame? I’m not sure I have one, but I’m proud to have lived and worked as a creative director in Cape Town, New Delhi, London and Amsterdam, with some of the best minds at some of the best agencies in the world.3. Describe your career so far. My career has been pretty unconventional and that’s made it all the more interesting. My first job was to start an agency with legends Brian Searle-Tripp and Bob Rightford, as a fledgeling art director and designer plucked out of my final year at college. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1411/241269-120x120.jpg" alt="How Rightford, Searle-Tripp &amp; Makin gave SA advertising a Wallop!" width="120" height="120">How Rightford, Searle-Tripp & Makin gave SA advertising a Wallop!What better way to celebrate Ogilvy's current successes than by hosting the book launch about the men who started off father agency Rightford, Searle-Tripp & Makin...By Leigh Andrews 19 Nov 2014I moved on to run my own creative studio, which became the conceptual and strategic arm of both Grey Cape Town and Amperzand (which evolved into OfYT). I entered my first award show 12 years into my career, after my stint at Wieden+Kennedy (W+K), when I joined King James and won a number of local and global accolades with the amazing team there. I took my next leap to start the African office of Arcade – a global network out of Asia and moved on to join HaveYouHeard. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515895-120x120.jpg?2" alt="McFadyen captions this: &amp;quot;Our Saturday morning ritual, croissants and starting the day in Green Point Park.&amp;quot;" width="120" height="120">#BehindtheSelfie with...

Tell us a few of your favourite things. My wife Casey and two daughters, Leah and Sophie are my number one faves, followed closely by my dad, brother, sister and extended family. My personal passion is music, which I listen to, study and play on my guitar and piano.I love food more than Brick Tamland loves lamp. Stuffing my face is also a large reason for my travel lust.Japan is my favourite place on the planet because it combines so much of what I love – refined food, deeply layered culture, an inspirational way of life, unparalleled sensibility and civility, wonderful people, the best in design, ancient history. Did I mention the food?<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/522566.jpg" alt="Berkowitz also submitted this 'non-selfie', and explains: &amp;quot;This was taken on my recent visit to Tokyo with brother and my dad.

What do you love about your industry? Advertising and communication is being forced to evolve and find relevance in a world-changing at a rate of knots. It’s fascinating, challenging, exciting and sometimes downright confusing to be part of this massive period of reinvention for our industry. The best part of my career though, which will always remain constant, is getting to work with interesting and highly talented colleagues and clients, who allow me to poke my nose into so many other cool worlds, daily. Not having to wear a suit every day is a bonus!6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists.

My brain, a black Pentel Sign marker, an A3 pad of pristine white pages and coffee, coupled with the internet, followed by email, Word and PowerPoint. Every now and then, I head back into the land of Adobe to make something, but not as much as I’d like.8. Who is getting it right in your industry? I have the utmost respect for Wieden+Kennedy as the finest independent creative network in the world. Having had the privilege of working there for four years, I learned that their real secret is having the best people, often putting the ‘wrong’ people into traditional roles and giving them every opportunity to shine. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/484469-120x120.jpg?2" alt="A screen grab from Nike's 'Get crazier'." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Nike 'dreams crazier' with Caster and SerenaNike's 'Dream crazier' taps into the inclusion and equality mindset, and shows that girls who want to play like boys need to dream crazier, while serving to destigmatise and reframe the world's interpretation of 'crazy'...By Leigh Andrews 4 Mar 2019Their unwavering ideals to always put the work first, never be afraid to fail, don’t get stuck in ‘sharp stuff’ or act big and be a partner to their clients – not just provide them a service – is why they’ve consistently managed to place the brands they work with at the centre of culture in every country they’ve opened an office in, for as long as they’ve been around.9. List a few pain points the industry can improve on. We’re all trying to wrangle an ever-changing media landscape and communicate with an audience that is globally connected, which chooses when, how and what they want to interact with. We’ve come a long way, but we need to adapt faster in how we operate and let go of the legacy processes and approaches that get in the way of better work and better business. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1708/408759-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Ryan McFadyen is one the co-founders of hyh, previously HaveYouHeard" width="120" height="120">HaveYouHeard's new identity offers a more holistic approach to advertisingCo-founder of HaveYouHeard, Ryan McFadyen, chats about how the company's new identity benefits the business from a marketing perspective and also shares the creative challenges they faced during the rebranding process...By Juanita Pienaar 1 Sep 2017We need to prove ourselves again in a tough global business environment to be an absolutely essential and integrated part of our client’s businesses.Sometimes we can slip into our own little echo chamber, paying too much attention to what everyone else in our industry is doing and who’s winning, rather than immersing ourselves in the world out there. I believe it’s the only way we’ll give the brands we serve the opportunity to do things that really matter to people, and deliver real results.10. What are you working on right now? Getting better at everything I possibly can.11. Tell us some of the buzzwords floating around in your industry at the moment, and some of the catchphrases you utter yourself.

Where and when do you have your best ideas? The first three hours of the morning are ‘go time’ for my brain. The sparks usually start firing as I open my eyes, form a bit more on the drive in, and rattle out onto the page as soon as I sit at my desk.

What’s your secret talent/party trick? I subconsciously spout out music trivia and sing whatever happens to be playing on my internal radio station, which usually leads to the tunes switching to something new and interesting when hanging out with friends.14. Are you a technophobe or a technophile? A technophile with analogue tendencies.

Lots of photos. Lots of music apps. Lots of apps I don’t know why I have.16. What advice would you give to newbies hoping to crack into the industry? Beyond skills and talent, the most important thing a prospective employer looks for is personality, character and attitude. They are your most powerful weapon if you want to stand out. Deciding between two great portfolios comes down to whether or not you want to work with the person behind them every day, and if they’ll be a positive force and influence for the rest of the team.When you get your first shot, start by focussing on being the very best at what you’re best at. Hone your skills while you’re learning and picking up more, and you’ll create your own room to grow while making yourself an indispensable part of the team. Building your career from the get-go means committing to consistently evolving as a professional. Take on more than you’re given and push yourself to do the things you want to ultimately be doing. Sometimes you’ll fail, but you’ll also get it right. Most importantly, you’ll get better every time, regardless of the result. It won’t be long before you’re being asked to do those things.
