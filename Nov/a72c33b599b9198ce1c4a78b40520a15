<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/529162.jpg" alt="Big things are brewing between LSB and Decimal Agency" width="500" height="375" align="left">The edgy eatery has enlisted top through-the-line agency, Decimal Agency, to bring the brand's eccentricity to life through all its brand communications, from digital marketing to branding.LSB is a collection of contradictions: a curious clash between a classic English pub and a contemporary graffiti showcase, where the most extraordinary drinking, dining and dancing experiences collide.  From the defaced renaissance portraits and antique furniture, to the cheeky graffiti splashed throughout, the décor in LSB is cool for being anti-cool.It's an off-beat pub that's peculiar yet unpretentious, offering a large selection of beers and quirky cocktails. An expressive eatery that serves up pub-inspired food that's deliciously different..."We had a vision to create a space unlike any other in Joburg. I've always been inspired by the social atmosphere of British beer gardens and pubs, and wanted to bring this to life, but with an edgy, modern spin," says Co-founder and Managing Director of LSB, Thanasi Nicolopoulos. "We needed the playful spirit of our brand to live across all communications, and right from the first pitch, Decimal just 'got it'!"And Decimal Agency has been hands-on from inception, from décor inspiration to menu design development. "It's been an absolute blast to be part of this brand's development right from its infancy," says Raffaele Mc Creadie, Managing Director of Decimal Agency. "A brand this young and nonconformist is any agency's dream because it allows for the blue sky thinking that's usually left in brainstorms. The bravery of the brand has unleashed our creativity to run wild." LSB officially launched in November in Pineslopes, Fourways, and the brand is looking forward to becoming renowned as "Joburg's most badass bar".
