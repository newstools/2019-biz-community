We really wanted to find the right problem to solve and build a company around the solution to that problem. During one of our meetings in mid-2017, we were both frustrated with how difficult it was to get the right workers to do maintenance tasks at our homes - and so, Jobbie was born. We officially launched in Cape Town in January 2018..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is the core function of Jobbie?Jobbie is a platform that connects customers and workers. We give customers the ability to post jobs, to get quotes from workers, to review the ratings that workers received for other jobs, and to eventually appoint and pay a worker through the app once the job is completed. We give workers access to thousands of new customers and provide them with marketing support. Workers who do excellent work and get excellent ratings are rewarded with more jobs. Jobbie enables workers to accept card payments - all of this from the convenience of a mobile device - anytime, anywhere..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What are some of the obstacles you've had to overcome since starting out?In a startup, you need to play all of the different roles. Jan and I both have technical backgrounds which meant that we had to learn new skills that are outside of our comfort zones (e.g. market and competitive analysis, financial projections, marketing, pitch decks, etc.).

There are still so many aspects of people's lives that can be improved by innovative tech solutions, and so many new things/experiences that we can't even think of now that innovative tech solutions will bring.

You need the expertise, experience and the funds to achieve this which is not always readily available. Highlights for us come in everyday small forms: hearing your ad on the radio, seeing positive feedback from customers and workers, seeing an article about your company on a national website and talking to workers that really have seen an increase in their income due to your business..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Why would you encourage someone to become an entrepreneur?Entrepreneurship allows you to create something brand new (your own "baby") that can positively impact a large group of people and the economy of South Africa (and hopefully beyond).
