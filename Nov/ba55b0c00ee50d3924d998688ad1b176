To combat this, advertisers’ focus needed to shift to the experience for the end consumer, which would, in turn, improve the impact of brands’ campaigns by: reaching the right people; being contextually relevant; and reducing ad wastage, which would increase ROI and create buying efficiencies.Programmatic solutions were an entirely new way of thinking that changed digital advertising by taking the way consumers were being targeted to a new level. By utilising various indicators, the programmatic solution was able to deduce data points that could paint a better, more intricate picture of the user.  The adoption of this new way of reaching people by marketers meant that messages could be tailored to appeal to individuals with unique personalities and needs, as opposed to a generic communication.
