I get to do what I am passionate about, every day, every week. And I get paid for it!.bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Any career highlights you’re particularly proud of? I’m just loving our morning show so much right now. I really feel good about our morning family, listeners share so much with us – they make us laugh and cry with us. Also, I got to do a tour with my band last year and take our radio show’s listeners with me on the journey. Our Vir die liefde tour was very special. I love playing everywhere in our beautiful country, meeting new people, playing interesting stages and shows – as well as road trips.

I recently had to read the book by the daughter of the ‘Springs Monster’, who was a guest on the show.

I guess many people still don’t know about my career as a singer. I have an Afrikaans music career. I record, I perform with my band pretty much whenever I can. I’m also the lead singer of Kinky Robot. We still record and perform from time to time too.Catch Bester weekdays on Jacaranda FM, from 6am to 9am and click through to Jacaranda FM’s press office for the latest news and updates.
