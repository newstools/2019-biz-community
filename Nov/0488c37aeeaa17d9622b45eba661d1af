I come from a very small community, Klipfontein Mission Station, next to the Cape Town International Airport. I lived there until the age of 15 as I moved away from my dad and stepmom to live with my real mom in Lansdowne. I grew up very poor with not many resources. I am the middle child of five children. I am a mom of three daughters and a wife to the most amazing husband my best friend. And I am of Christian faith..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}How and when did you get started?I started my business journey at the age of 11 – could even be younger – I remember cleaning people's homes or going to the shops for them and they would pay me. After I got married, I would start a business every month and every time it would fail miserably, but the next day I would be back planning yet another business. My current business, Milli Distributions, journey started a year and seven months ago. I was invited to a networking event in 2017 and met Hyasintha Ntuyeko from Tanzania, the founder and designer of the Glory Pad – which will be arriving this month in South Africa. Early in 2018, I flew to Johannesburg to cement our partnership and April, that same year, Milli Distributions was registered..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What is the core function of Milli Distributions?We are the sole distributors of the Glory Pad and currently also adding more organic products to our portfolio.

I was declined thrice by government institutions and for any other government institutions, my business did not qualify. I kept going and believing and applying until Absa Bank assisted but did so much more – they partnered.The other part was getting retailers on board to stock my product and this was out of my comfort zone and an industry unknown to me but I kept calling and going and now have a purchase order from a reputable retailer and a few smaller outlets to have our product in. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What have been your proudest achievements thus far?I spoke of having an imports business, six years ago, and even went to apply for the licence but could not get it. Now, we do and to have our product come into South Africa is a proud moment for both me and my family because they understand my journey. And to see it available in stores and online will be yet another proud moment for me..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Would you encourage someone to become an entrepreneur?YES! My daughters included..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Where do you see your business in five years' time?Five years from now, I would love to manufacture locally – creating 1,000 or more job opportunities within South Africa..bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What do you believe are the traits an entrepreneur needs in order to succeed?Never give up, keep going!
