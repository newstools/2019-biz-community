The two founding members, Fhatuwani Mukheli and Vuyo Mpantsha, were highly involved in the conception and making of Scottish Leader's new Soweto Heart whisky, which is exclusive to South Africa.SA meets ScotlandScottish Leader invited the duo to visit Scotland and meet with the Scottish Leader blending team, headed up by Dr Kirstie Maccullum, one of the few female master mistillers in the world.“Scotland was a mind-blowing experience,” says Mukheli. “How the mixing of all the elements comes together to make a Scottish Leader whisky is incredible; it is in fact both an art and a science. The team at the distillery were nothing but edifying and welcoming. We told them about some of our favourite flavours back home and the wonderful memories they conjure, which they captured beautifully.”Although Scottish Leader Soweto Heart was crafted in Scotland, it is inspired by South Africa, with tasting notes of milk chocolate and toffee to satisfy the South African sweet tooth. The label and carton design also reflects the collaboration between Scotland and South Africa. The result is a fusion of the renowned Scottish tartan and a more contemporary South African pattern, brought to life with vibrant colours and textures. “We at Scottish Leader are thrilled to share this new variant with South African whisky lovers. While we have had the pleasure of working with ISADY on previous projects, this is definitely the most exciting venture for all of us,” says Lynsay Sampson, marketing manager: whisky and white spirits at Distell. “ISADY has welcomed us into their world, and we wanted to extend the same courtesy by welcoming them to our home in Scotland.”“ISADY embodies the Scottish Leader philosophy that magic can be found simply by taking a different view on the world around you. They have been instrumental in dispelling long-held negative perceptions about Soweto, and showing instead of the pride of Sowetans, their sense of style, their love of art, and the vibrance and energy of the township,” continues Sampson.Reframing SowetoISADY has been committed to their vision of reframing the stories of Soweto since 2011, when they launched a photographic blog showcasing images that captured their neighbourhood’s uniqueness and contradictions. ISADY’s work has now evolved into the creation of an agency that specialises in photography and film.To celebrate the launch of Soweto Heart and showcase its namesake’s origin and heritage, ISADY will be visiting and documenting a few of Soweto’s diverse neighbourhoods over the next few weeks. These will include Pimville, the real home of ISADY; Dube, made famous by Moroko Swallows; and Mfulo, best known for having the first movie house in Soweto – Eyethu Bioskop.
