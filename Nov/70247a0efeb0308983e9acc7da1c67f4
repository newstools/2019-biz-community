International intrigue and global crises are above their pay grade, but there is no shortage of betrayal, alliances, or comedic intrigue. Move On is a comedy series about a frantic romantic on a desperate quest to silence her late husband’s ghost who barges in on every date with a consoling message for her potential suitors.TAC Studios’ brand new unscripted finished series My Design Rules, a home design competition series, and May’s Kitchen, an original cooking series filmed in Egypt, were created with a global aesthetic for audiences both across Africa as well as for North American and UK Pay TV. They come on hot on the heels of other recent productions from TAC Studios including, Africa on a Plate, Minjiba Entertains, and World Wide Nate, which have successfully been distributed to platforms in Africa as well as globally. Narendra Reddy, general manager of The Africa Channel adds, “Our finished and in-development originals stands testament to our commitment to building and investing in talent to foster quality and excellence in media production on the continent. We anticipate engaging with local broadcast networks seeking finished shows and investment in pre-sales in content that is uniquely African with an international production aesthetic.”
