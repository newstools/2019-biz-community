Only you and those you share them with will be able to access them,” Google explained on My Storytime’s website.Once a story is uploaded onto the platform, users can ask the Assistant to play them by saying “Hey Google, talk to My Storytime”.Essentially, My Storytime gives families a platform to stay in touch when they can’t in real-time.Additionally, Google Assistant now features the ability to read out the news and buy movie tickets for users in the United States.
