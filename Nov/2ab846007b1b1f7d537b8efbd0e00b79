It just shows what an incredible country we live in and the love we have for each other as proud South African’s. It is in our DNA! To all our sponsors, partners, listeners and friends, you blow us away every single year, when you open your hearts and pockets and pledge to change lives. Hot 91.9FM would like to say a heartfelt, sincere and resounding Thank You!’ You have made the Hot 91.9FM Birthday wish come true once over and over!”Teddy-Thon kicked off with the “Mansfield in the Morning” breakfast team who were on top form when they passed R1m mark before 9am. It was then up to Mark Pilgrim to encourage listeners across Johannesburg and South Africa to pledge and help Hot Cares reach their goal. Bunny Majaja and Tony Murrell kicked off the afternoon and watched the barometer go over the R2m mark and then The Big Joburg Drive with Simon Parkinson got the station over the line. Musically, performances were in abundance and the public were treated to live sets by  Beverley Jayne, Pedro Barbosa , Miloh Ramai, RJ Benjamin, the great Daniel Baron and then turning Teddy-Thon into an old skool party was SA’s party band Dr Victor & The Rasta Rebels.
