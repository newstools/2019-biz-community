She is also an inspirational leader, who mentored many of our greatest achievers,” said Ogilvy South Africa CEO Alistair Mokoena. “We are confident that she will achieve great success in this new role. We congratulate her on this exciting and well-deserved elevation.” In her new role, Oosthuizen will be based in London, but will remain active within Ogilvy South Africa.
