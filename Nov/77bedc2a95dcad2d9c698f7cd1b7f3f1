Image: Leigh AndrewsIf you’re in the marketing research, media or publishing industry in South Africa, you can’t say no to an event that offers planning insights based on the real consumer’s authentic brand consumption behaviour and longitudinal digital behaviour. This helps you maximise both media and device synergy to increase your ROI.That’s where the PRC’s new fused datasets and findings prove their worth.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/444572.jpg" alt="PRC brings Nielsen fused brand and PAMS data to enrich understanding of consumption" width="120" height="120">PRC brings Nielsen fused brand and PAMS data to enrich understanding of consumptionNielsen will release consumer panel data fused with 2017 PAMS data in August this year. This is an enhanced survey that will provide the industry with rich information on 200 consumer goods categories and more than 5,000 brands...Issued by Nielsen 12 Jun 2018The new data obtained in the survey is the largest, most robust sample of FMCG brand penetration, profile and volumes in the SA marketplace and speaks to the PRC’s new business vision.While the PRC pioneered media survey fusion in SA last year, they’ve since further fused a digital study to this, to provide a more extensive understanding of consumer digital behaviour.Three fused studies give triple the insightsPRC CEO Josephine Buys explains:This ‘day in the life’ data at a brand level will provide unsurpassed planning insights to planners and advertisers, enabling them to maximise both media and device synergy to increase advertising ROI.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517840-120x120.jpg?2" alt="CEO of the PRC, Josephine Buys.

SEM Supergroups are based on where changes in lifestyle are found in the segment profiles and deliver the granularity required by agencies and publishers...23 Sep 2019At the event, she adds that the future is fusion, with three fused studies giving triple the insights, before handing over to Peter Langschmidt, lead consultant to the PRC.Langschmidt told attendees of his recent experience at the Rugby World Cup in Japan, dressed in full Zulu attire and teaching the attentive Japanese fans to sing ‘Shosholoza’ in just 20 minutes. Fittingly, we echoed this activity in the Inner City Ideas Cartel at the Old Foundry before learning more about the SA dataset fusion journey…The SA dataset fusion journeyBack in 2013, the Saarf board looked to futureproof Amps with the Establishment Survey’s ‘hub and spokes’ model. In the six years since then, they have found that you don’t need that central hub as the model works well as a snake or chain that can have additional surveys added on. As a result, last year’s Pams was fused with Nielsen's consumer panel survey (CPS) data.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/460487-120x120.jpg?2" alt="PRC and Nielsen launch Fusion 101" width="120" height="120">PRC and Nielsen launch Fusion 101The Publisher Research Council and Nielsen launched a 'fused' survey, called Fusion - said to change the face of research in South Africa - in Johannesburg and Cape Town last week...28 Sep 2018Jos Kuper said in a telephonic call supporting last year’s fusion project:The world is not the same as it was 50 years ago when Amps was the ‘gold standard’, there’s a new global ‘gold-standard’ relevant to a far more complex and diverse media landscape. Even since the future-proofing audience research exercise, fusion has become a more successful technique and I wholeheartedly stand by the Nielsen and PRC approach to implementing the model we presented to the Saarf board five years ago.That’s why a new level has been added, with digital data added to the mix. Langschmidt mentioned that next year’s release will also stack new audience data.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/523712-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: M. B.

Fusion data offers a richer, more granular result than what you get from single-source studies. You can also layer in your own customer databases, which Langschmidt calls an exciting development, but he cautions to be careful when comparing data to note whether the results are based on just the online or the total universe.How media viewing has changedLangschmidt whet attendees’ appetites by sharing slides on how consumers’ ways of viewing media have changed.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513998-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Rita Morais on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">How publishing platforms make the most of human attentionPublishing platforms offer a rare opportunity to communicate effectively, writes PRC CEO Josephine Buys...By Josephine Buys 29 Aug 2019For example, 42% reported favouring standard live TV broadcasts, while for online services for TV and movies, YouTube comes in at 37%.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527346.jpg" alt="The PRC on why the future of data is fusion" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1911/527349.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="600" data-lheight="400" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527348.jpg" alt="The PRC on why the future of data is fusion" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1911/527350.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="600" data-lheight="400" class="gflipper-image" align="center">When it comes to time spent on the media, Langschmidt said it’s important not to look at the national average, as 80% of South Africans are still not doing the bulk of their media viewing online. As a result, when it comes to devices, you’ll note less is watched via computer and more on smartphones, especially at the bottom of the market.Note distracted consumers’ second screening<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/466985-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Reading delivers the proven best advertising ROI" width="120" height="120">Reading delivers the proven best advertising ROIReading, i.e. Digital and Print combined, consistently deliver the greatest ROI for every R1 spent than any other medium...By Peter Langschmidt 5 Nov 2018When analysing activity by platform by daypart, Langschmidt shared that TV really comes into its own in the evening, with reading more dominant in the morning.Looking at the types of programming watched via the internet, it becomes clear that the days of sitting around the TV set and watching it exclusively are gone. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1603/335352-120x120.jpg?2" alt="TV is no longer the hero of the living room" width="120" height="120">TV is no longer the hero of the living roomI remember growing up in the Seventies, when watching TV was a special occasion; we actually dressed up for it. TV wasn't yet fully adopted in the black community, but together we would gather and watch it at one of the neighbour's houses who were one of the early adopters...By Laiza Zikalala 18 Mar 2016Today, most of us engage in distracted or ‘dual viewing’, where we split our attention between the TV set and using the internet on our handheld devices at the same time. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527352.jpg" alt="The PRC on why the future of data is fusion" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1911/527353.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="600" data-lheight="400" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527355.jpg" alt="The PRC on why the future of data is fusion" width="600" height="400" rel="/c/1911/527356.jpg?0" data-height="400" data-lwidth="600" data-lheight="400" class="gflipper-image" align="center">Again, this is based on only on the internet universe findings and not the total, with as many as 60% reporting “doing something else” while watching TV. Langschmidt promised they will return in April 2020 with more fusion data findings.The Fusion 2019 report was gifted to attendees in printed format, making it easy to see all 3,000 brands and questionnaires, but you can also click here to download it in full. Buys concluded the session with a reminder to visit the PRC website and Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn channels regularly, as their publisher members are steadily moving to the platform economy and the PRC is following suit by releasing information in the digital space on a regular basis.
