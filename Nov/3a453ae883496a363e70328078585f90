R-Squared offers an innovative world-class solution – the R-Squared Influencer Academy, a white-labelled program personalised for brands, established to mitigate risks from unsolicited posts while increasing brand alignment and positive engagement. A chronology of how the need arises  An influencer posts an unsolicited piece of content and tags the brand.  On seeing the post, the brand weighs the value and is either happy about it or not. For instance, a wrong engagement question like "Why do you think that this brand’s product is awesome?" could trigger negative comments, including comments from the audience driving other audience members to a competitor product. Either way, brands wonder what they can do to encourage or improve on these pieces of unsolicited content. So what can brands do? Brands can take advantage of the R-Squared Influencer Academy, designed to coach and give tips, hints and advice to influencers who post unsolicited brand content, so as to mitigate risk, increase quality and brand alignment for unsolicited posts that would have gone live anyway without the added value of the coaching. Brands can thus reward their most ardent advocates with coaching from R-Squared experts. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525121.jpg" alt="Unsolicited influencer posts: Ensure perfect brand alignment" width="625" height="1563"> Brand and R-Squared agree on the service to be provided (e.g. which category of influencer qualifies for assistance, etc.).  Brand fully briefs R-Squared on brand and product positioning.  R-Squared sets up a white-labelled contact centre for the brand (email and WhatsApp).  Influencers submit the content by email or WhatsApp to the point of contact for the influencer’s academy setup for the brand.  R-Squared coaches and guides the influencers for risk mitigation, and increased brand alignment.  Post goes live.  Influencers and brands are happy.
