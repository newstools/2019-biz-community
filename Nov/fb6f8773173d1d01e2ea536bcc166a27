Being awarded the Overall Agency of the Year Award, while surprising, is both humbling and an honour, she adds. “We are thrilled that the industry is recognising the role purpose has to place and the role agencies and clients have to play in fostering a better South Africa and Africa.”  As an all-female agency, the Transformation Award is also a special award. “Being recognised for having a big impact in an industry that is still quite male-dominated is an inspiration for us and to others,” she says.   Be in the gameAnother believer in making an impact in the industry is this year’s Industry Leader Award winner, M&C Saatchi Abel’s Neo Mashigo. “When I got into the industry, I decided I will make an impact wherever I can – be it a client, a campaign or the people I meet and engage with.”  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/529053.jpg" alt="Industry Leader of the Year, Neo Mashigo, CCO at M&amp;C Saatchi Abel | Image supplied by Financial Mail" width="625" height="417">Industry Leader of the Year, Neo Mashigo, CCO at M&C Saatchi Abel | Image supplied by Financial MailHe says you must be in the game. “You cannot complain from the sidelines when things are not working. You need to jump in and when you jump into that pot, you understand just how hot it is and that it is not simple or easy to change something. But you cannot just watch, you need to get involved.”  His advice to younger people wanting to enter the industry is that it takes hard work. “There is no easy way. You have to put in the hard work, and then you see the results, and it starts looking and feeling easy and then you can roll with the punches, because you put in the hard slog earlier."After high school, my mom said to me that work is a form of prayer, and if you dedicate yourself to that one thing that you choose and work hard, then your prayers will be answered. You cannot do nothing and expect a miracle. You have to do the hard work,” he says. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/529029-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Neo Mashigo, chief creative officer of M&amp;C Saatchi Abel, announced as the FM AdFocus industry leader 2019.

We have always set the bar high, he has just come in and set it higher.” He adds that Mashigo helped in setting their transformation agenda and bringing in amazing talent. “A lot of them have joined because of Neo. When you are a good person and use your talent and a great leader, then things seem to fall into place.”  M&C Saatchi Abel, which is celebrating its 10th birthday next year, was also named Large Agency of the Year. “You always hope you are doing a great job, but outside validation always confirms it, and when that comes from our industry peers, then it is a wonderful achievement,” adds Abel. With the industry going through some tough times, this award is even more gratifying. “We have a very simple offering for our clients: are we going to grow your top line, are we going to grow your market share, are we going to grow your brand equity. I think it is that focus applied to our model of brutal simplicity that works particularly well in a downturn economy.”  The agency also received the Partnership of the Year Award, sponsored by IAS, with its client Nando’s.  Lifetime AchieverAny award that says 'lifetime' talks about how much time you have spent in the industry, and I spent a lot of time in the industry, says Virginia Hollis, who was named AdFocus’ Lifetime Achiever 2019. “It’s an industry that I love, otherwise I would not be here, but for me the industry is about giving back as well. Over the past 25 years I have spent more than just doing my job, and if there is anything I could do, it is to encourage people in our industry to get more involved with the industry and help develop people,” she says. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/529063.jpg" alt="Lifetime Achiever, Virginia Hollis | Image supplied by Financial Mail" width="625" height="417">Lifetime Achiever, Virginia Hollis | Image supplied by Financial MailGrowing the industry is very important. “We are a wonderful industry and we are irreverent when we need to be, but at the same time we are a very serious industry.
