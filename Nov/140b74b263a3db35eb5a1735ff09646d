Moderator Aubrey Hruby is author and investment advisor of Africa Expert Network, with panelists Ahmad Mokhles, group COO of Liquid Telecom; Sekou Drame, CEO of Sonatel Group; Nitin Gajria, SSA director of Google; and Dr Alison Gillwald, executive director of Research ICT Africa.Aubrey Hruby, author and investment advisor of Africa Expert Network, served as chair and MC for the second day of AfricaCom. Offering a snapshot of where we find ourselves, Hruby shared that while she's based in Washington, she has worked in 35 African countries over the past 18 years. As a result, she's well aware of the fact that we're living in a time where we face one of the largest challenges in history – job creation in African markets. We've failed at formalising the informal sectorGiving some shape and colour to the problem, Hruby said many of the jobs we create today may not look like jobs of the past. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1512/325556-120x120.jpg?2" alt="How microcredit has hurt the poor and destroyed informal business" width="120" height="120">How microcredit has hurt the poor and destroyed informal businessPost-apartheid South Africa provides ample evidence of the debilitating trajectory of the microcredit...By Milford Bateman 30 Dec 2015Up to 90% of them will be created in the informal sector, Hernando De Soto wrote almost 80 years ago of capital being locked up, yet that prescription for the formal sector has failed. Hruby adds that we have 'failed at formalising the informal sector'.For example, Kenya's unemployment figures for the past decade, show that of new jobs created, just 15% to 17% are in the formal sector. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1309/146741-120x120.jpg" alt="Kenyan youths see opportunity in digital outsourcing" width="120" height="120">Kenyan youths see opportunity in digital outsourcingBusiness process outsourcing is a niche that has unlimited potential to employ Kenya's youth, especially in back-end data processing, according to Jeremy Hockenstein, chief executive officer at Digital Divide Data (DDD), a social enterprise and impact sourcing service provider.By David Njagi 18 Sep 2013That’s the reality we face, but it's not necessarily a bad thing.The 'side-hustle' continentNot only are African markets informal, but the gig economy is changing how jobs are looked at, period. When we look to informal trade, Hruby adds that today, many have a 9 to 5, a 5 to 9 and a weekend job on this, the ‘side-hustle’ continent. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/514366.jpg" alt="Having a side hustle is now mainstream in SA" width="120" height="120">Having a side hustle is now mainstream in SAAs many as one-in-four working South Africans are operating some kind of side hustle...By Estelle Nagel 31 Aug 2019So instead of aiming at moving all of that to the formal sector, how can we make the work that's being done more productive? This is largely a young and urban population so traditional ways of work don't necessarily appeal to them.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/503403-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Traders gather at CoCT's annual Informal Economy Summit" width="120" height="120">Traders gather at CoCT's annual Informal Economy SummitCape Town's informal economy sustains about 140,000 individuals by providing much-needed income for vulnerable households...25 Jun 2019Hruby spoke of the creative sector as a good place to start, as it's about creating non-rival goods we can watch locally and export for further consumption.She says the world has never been more ready to absorb African creative products, with Nigeria's Nollywood film production proving itself invaluable when it comes to job creation.Hruby then introduced her panel guests, who shared their ideas on what we need to take this momentum forward.Mobile pricing as a pre-condition for the digital economy to take offFraming the current challenge of the time, of whether data is too expensive, Dr Alison Gillwald, executive director of Research ICT Africa, said that their African Mobile Pricing Index has done considerable work on pricing as a precondition for the digital economy to take off. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1610/362912-120x120.jpg?2" alt="SA mobile data costs among world's most expensive" width="120" height="120">SA mobile data costs among world's most expensiveLocal data package experts, Tariffic, released information comparing the price that South Africans pay for 'data only' packages to comparative countries...5 Oct 2016Even where we have low prices, like in Nigeria and Mozambique, data and smartphones are still largely unaffordable and comprise a big portion of the population's 'non-income' spend, so we need new ways to get those costs down. Gillwald says bringing in community networks and niche players could assist. While the biggest barrier is the cost of devices, bigger challenges lie in the innovation models. Aside from affordability of device and data, we need to consider the quantity and quality of time spent online. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/468748-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Africacom2018: What's really chewing up your data" width="120" height="120">#Africacom2018: What's really chewing up your data"I never subscribed for that, now all my data is gone!"

He said it's not only fragmentation of markets that need to be factored in, but also the need for frequency adjustments and the fact that there isn't consistent regulation across the continent. The lack of electricity in some regions is another concern, as that’s basic infrastructure. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525896-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Scanlan presenting at AfricaCom 2019." width="120" height="120">#AfricaCom: How to accelerate digital transformation to 5G the right wayThe 22nd edition of Africacom took place from 12 to 14 November 2019 at the CTICC in Cape Town.

He also pointed out that business models are evolving so it’s actually a digital evolution, not a revolution. He adds that it's largely the Western world that would like to see Africa shift from its largely informal trading mindset to the more formal model, but he does not see this happening, as doing so would mean stepping back to a processing rather than innovating industry.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477403.jpg" alt="Liquid Telecom appoints new regional CEO for MEWA" width="120" height="120">Liquid Telecom appoints new regional CEO for MEWAPan-African telecoms group, Liquid Telecom has appointed Mohamed Abdel Bassit as its new Regional CEO for Middle East and West Africa...11 Jan 2019Gillwald added that old assumptions around competitive markets are obsolete as people who can afford to do so are paying for quality.

Probably not. How do we nurture digital literacy and skills once the infrastructure is in place? Gajria said that Google’s CS First educational programme brings in the primary school coding as it's not just about providing access, or digital literacy so that they know the various services that can be used online, but upskilling the next generation to co-create the digital future.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515231.jpg" alt="Google's CS First to teach computer science to kids" width="120" height="120">Google's CS First to teach computer science to kidsGoogle South Africa recently announced the launch of CS First - an ambitious programme aimed at equipping South African learners with the fundamentals of computer science.

To get around this, Gillward says we need to review what we’ve got and focus on the regional issues like failing to release spectrum, and support these challenges with proper demand-side interventions, not just on the supply-side in connecting public buildings.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/526705-625x325.jpg?2" alt="#FairnessFirst: Tech skills needed to create future jobs on the 'side-hustle' continent" width="625" height="325">© Richard Van der Spuy via 123RFGajria says it's an exciting time as they expect we will see another 150 million people online in the next two years.
