Working across the corporate identity, Boomtown created a new brand architecture for the company that included updated contemporary photography, website development, and an e-brochure. The objective was to develop a clear brand narrative and communication directive for the business’ key audiences. To do this, Boomtown immersed itself in the business and the industry to be able to clearly define the Mertech Cable and Wire unique selling points, brand personality and purpose from a long-term strategic perspective. With this foundation, a succinct and transparent communication strategy was developed, as well as relevant design collateral which will bring the brand positioning to life. Mertech Marine recovers and recycles redundant telecommunications cables from the seabed, and with Mertech Cable and Wire manufactures a wide range of high-quality steel cables and wire products – providing a full end-to-end solution that complements the Mertech Group’s zero to landfill vision.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/528923.jpg" alt="Boomtown develops the Mertech brand" width="550" height="550" rel="/c/1911/528924.jpg?0" data-height="550" data-lwidth="547" data-lheight="826" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/528925.jpg" alt="Boomtown develops the Mertech brand" width="550" height="550" rel="/c/1911/528926.jpg?0" data-height="550" data-lwidth="826" data-lheight="550" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/528927.jpg" alt="Boomtown develops the Mertech brand" width="550" height="550" rel="/c/1911/528928.jpg?0" data-height="550" data-lwidth="826" data-lheight="549" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/528929.jpg" alt="Boomtown develops the Mertech brand" width="550" height="550" rel="/c/1911/528930.jpg?0" data-height="550" data-lwidth="550" data-lheight="826" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/528931.jpg" alt="Boomtown develops the Mertech brand" width="550" height="550" rel="/c/1911/528932.jpg?0" data-height="550" data-lwidth="826" data-lheight="550" class="gflipper-image" align="center"><img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/528933.jpg" alt="Boomtown develops the Mertech brand" width="550" height="550" rel="/c/1911/528934.jpg?0" data-height="550" data-lwidth="826" data-lheight="550" class="gflipper-image" align="center">
