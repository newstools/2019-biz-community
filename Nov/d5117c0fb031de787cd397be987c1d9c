<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525993.jpg" alt="Samsung on a mission to identify and support black industrialists" width="625" height="325">Samsung South Africa is running a search for two established black industrials in the e-waste sector, which require financial and business support, to take their business to the next level. The initiative is part of Samsung’s R280m Equity Equivalent Investment Programme (EEIP). EEIP is a Department of Trade and Industry (dti) initiative where multinational companies are invited to participate and contribute positively towards B-BBEE in South Africa. This programme is strongly aligned with the objectives of the National Development Plan 2030, which is the elimination of poverty through job creation and entrepreneurship.“Samsung is focussed on two very important missions – the growth of entrepreneurship in the country and the development of e-waste programmes. This e-waste project achieves both objectives and affirms our commitment to growing South Africa and preserving the nation’s natural resources,” says Hlubi Shivanda, Director: Business Innovation Group and Corporate Affairs at Samsung South Africa.Supporting the government’s black industrialist programmeSamsung, in collaboration with the dti, aims to provide opportunities for black industrialists in the recycling sector, to participate in the e-waste black industrialist program as one of the projects under EEIP. Samsung will be an integral partner in the creation of the only black-owned and operated e-waste beneficiation plants in Africa that can separate Waste Electronic and Electrical Equipment (WEEE). The objective is to develop and support the establishment of the e-waste Black Industrialists, who will be operating in the full value chain of e-waste management that include collection, dismantling, pre-processing and beneficiation of e-waste materials.Comprehensive business supportBusiness support includes grant funding for operational growth, mechanisation, skills development program (quality control, safety and business development) and the introduction of beneficiation plant technology. This Black Industrialist programme targets black Industrialists, including women. Ultimately through industrialisation, the aim is to create employment, boost innovation and grow the economy. Providing access to expertsSamsung has partnered with a black-owned incubator that will market, recruit and select the Industrialists for this programme. In addition, the incubator will support the selected enterprises for the duration of the programme.
