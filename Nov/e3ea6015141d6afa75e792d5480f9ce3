That’s where Google comes in, contributing to connectivity through Google Station,” says David Shapiro of Google’s Next Billion Users Initiative.He was talking at the first Google for South Africa event in Johannesburg recently, where the announcement was made.“Google is committed to making products that are helpful to South Africans and Africans,” explains Asha Patel, head of marketing at Google South Africa.The launch focused on communities who do not have access to data but where the infrastructure is available through partnerships to provide the service.“We work with internet providers and identify high traffic areas and then deploy the necessary infrastructure. This first partnership locally is with Think WiFi, while Showmax and Telkom are the first advertisers on the platform,” says Adama Bari Diallo, head of partnerships at Google’s Next Billion Users Africa.While building infrastructure that gets more people online is in line with their mission, they are not looking to be a telco.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515231.jpg" alt="Google's CS First to teach computer science to kids" width="120" height="120">Google's CS First to teach computer science to kidsGoogle South Africa recently announced the launch of CS First - an ambitious programme aimed at equipping South African learners with the fundamentals of computer science. The programme aims to train more than 30,000 learners across nine provinces in the space of a year...5 Sep 2019“But setting up this type of infrastructure gives access to other providers. If you look at the breadth of things we are working on in Africa, we need partners, so we are constantly talking and engaging with partners,” says Nitin Gajria, who leads the sub-Saharan Africa region at Google.At present, there are no immediate plans to expand the service. Gajria explains they want to get it right first in the communities they are in so that it works in the right manner. “We do not want to rush it and are spending a lot of time to see the impact of the location.”At Google, we talk about building for everyone, we believe that you cannot create products and services for communities without asking and co-creating with them.

By educating the community, we have had none of the sites vandalised,” says Patel.
