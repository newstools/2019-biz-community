Oando PLC is one of Africa’s largest integrated energy solutions providers with a reputation of being audacious and innovative.  The company participated at the exhibition as a sponsor and we provided a pristine white space to serve as a brand showcase. This year’s campaign took a creative lead from art and prominent personalities depicting the brand value of boldness. Key words were communicated throughout the exhibition space and overhead structures including:  Fearless, Formidable and Undeterred. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525612-625x136.jpg" alt="Oando at Africa Oil Week" width="625" height="136">A highlight was the illustration of efficient energy though the use of the popular Consol Solar jars.  We created a lighting feature above the hospitality area and delegates were also given the jars as gifts. AOW claims to be leading the way for investment and business development in Africa's oil and gas sector.  The event certainly provides a focused opportunity for international business and government participation.
