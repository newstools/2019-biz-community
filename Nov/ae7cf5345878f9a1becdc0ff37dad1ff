Just how relevant or valid is the client-agency relationship these days? Clearly, to this client, it‘s super important – which was great to hear!<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/443482-120x120.jpg?2" alt="South Africa on par when optimising the client-agency relationship" width="120" height="120">South Africa on par when optimising the client-agency relationshipTraditionally, marketers work with a larger number of creative agencies, but maintain longer relationships with media agencies, though recently these trends are not always true, this is according to the Scopen Agency Scope South Africa 2017/18...5 Jun 2018There’s a saying that Brian Solis coined called digital-Darwinism; it’s when technology and society evolves faster than humans. Scary, I know.But similar to how we all thought cookie-based targeting was the silver bullet to all our marketing challenges, we are starting to realise that perhaps technology doesn’t have all the answers and that as humans we are still exceptional at the one thing technology cannot do: have an emotional relationship.It still begs belief that client-agency contracts are finite; it’s not like when you marry your partner you only commit to a three-year term!

Right, so, to both clients and agencies alike, what are some of the ways we can enjoy our oft-fleeting relationships? I did some research online as well as some old-school human-to-human research, and here’s what I found.CommunicationIt goes without saying, right? But then why are so many relationships strained by a lack of clear and unambiguous communication? We communicate clearly with our friends and family because we feel comfortable enough to ask silly questions without fear of ridicule (well, mostly).Yet in a business relationship, we tend to use fancy terms and TLAs (three-letter acronyms) to sound knowledgeable and important. Meanwhile, we’ve just strained the relationship through miscommunication, and no-one wants to ask the so-called silly question.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/504902.jpg" alt="The Client Side: Kgosietsile Moalusi" width="120" height="120">The Client Side: Kgosietsile MoalusiI believe the brand and communication space beckons us to introspect insights that would make the relationship between company and agency work for the betterment of both parties...By Mogorosi Mashilo, Issued by TrendER 3 Jul 2019In his biography, Elon Musk talks about how he banned the use of acronyms in his companies without his written approval, for obvious reasons.Check your ego at the door!No one likes an egomaniac or narcissist, and in the client-agency relationship egos are not exactly scarce. One of the best marketers I had the privilege of working with, Roland Reid who was the marketing director at Jaguar Land Rover South Africa at the time, used to always remind us that we were there to progress the brand, not our egos.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1807/448107-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The crucial role of client service excellence in agencies" width="120" height="120">The crucial role of client service excellence in agenciesDeveloping client service excellence in order to properly service clients' campaigns is imperative for client retention, writes Mpho Nkomonde...By Mpho Nkomonde 9 Jul 2018Agencies are not always the guilty party here, but mostly we are. We all want to impress the client so much that our egos usurp the primary reason we’re all there, to solve business problems. When we forget our egos and put energy into solving the business challenges first, relationships foster and everyone wins.Warts and allWith social media being what it is, no agency is going to try and pull a fast one. If they did, the court of public opinion would write the death sentence for them.As agencies, we are in the business of helping our clients reach their business goals, to do great work and to be fairly compensated for it. The best relationships are formed when everyone plays open cards, with no hidden agendas.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506336.jpg" alt="Deep care is the holy grail of client management" width="120" height="120">Deep care is the holy grail of client managementTrust of course is central to a solid client relationship.

It’s like the ex-partner: your friends are like “wow, what took you so long?” as if you were oblivious to your ex-partner’s shortcomings. You weren’t, but because you liked, ahem, loved them, you didn’t have the heart to give them negative feedback.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1710/415265.jpg" alt="Frank talk: Rethinking value in agency-client relationships" width="120" height="120">Frank talk: Rethinking value in agency-client relationshipsFrankly, the current way of working between marketing agencies and clients is in a state of flux and we are not sure what's coming next. We have seen this before, but this time it's different...By Lynn Madeley, Issued by Havas Johannesburg 19 Oct 2017In our industry we often form close, sometimes lifelong bonds with our counterparts and the best relationships have open, honest and regular feedback at their core. A shortcut to relationship failure is letting things fester; create the means for constructive feedback sessions where concerns can be addressed, but also don’t be shy to celebrate the successes.In closing, ability, integrity and benevolence are at the heart of each point above. So it’s no surprise these are also foundational elements of building trust, both as individuals and as organisations.None of us are getting out of here alive, so we may as well enjoy it while we can and build relationships that make it all worthwhile. :)
