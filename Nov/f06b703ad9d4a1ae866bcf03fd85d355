So, it is ironic that by underplaying your brand during such periods, you are taking important signs of confidence away from your customers.This is why cutting back on brand positioning as a cost-saving measure is often self-defeating.But slashing budgets need not be the only strategy. Hard times are an opportunity to revisit marketing strategies and ask if there is a better way to do things – and yes, there is.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1707/400937-120x120.jpg?2" alt="How SA's recession is impacting consumer spending" width="120" height="120">How SA's recession is impacting consumer spendingWith Stats SA reporting a 0.7% GDP decrease in the first quarter of 2017, the announcement we were all dreading finally came in June...By Gareth Pearson 11 Jul 2017Targeted engagementThrough an on-site approach, organisations can radically improve their marketing activity.

You get the best of both agency models, but without the drawbacks. In difficult times, such a personal touch is important. Customers want to see it from their brands, and those brands need it from their agencies.

However, with the immediacy of being on-site, a client is able to walk over and say: ‘I've had this idea, how can we execute it? What do you think?’This is a very good way to deliver on business objectives.
