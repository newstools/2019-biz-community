The partnerships forged, investment opportunities identified, and deals closed are still being cited by attendees, and we intend to expand on these outcomes at the 2020 Summit in Morocco," said Florizelle Liser, President and CEO, Corporate Council on Africa.Following a strategic selection process, CCA's Board of Directors selected the Kingdom of Morocco as the host for the 2020 Summit.
