He shared, “Wunderman Thompson is the largest digital agency globally, and while digital transformation is all the rage in business these days, it has always been at the core of what Wunderman Thompson offers. The agency has continuously evolved its capabilities in response to a changing world; one that requires ongoing innovation. It’s wonderful to be part of this team with a distinct culture of progression. There’s a real sense that we’re building something amazing.”“In his role,” added Unati Moalusi, the agency’s chief people officer, “Bodibe is responsible for the agency’s 20-person department who work with the various business units sifting through the data and information, making sense of it and inspiring creatives and technologists to create experiences that engage with and excite audiences and users. The team operates across traditional ATL, digital and social media communication and marketing. They also work alongside the data and insights specialists who measure the impact of the various digital and social media marketing interventions.”Bodibe came from a media and journalism background before working in strategic marketing and brand consulting. He later joined the client-side in the telecoms space prior to joining adland, further fostering his telecoms experience by working on the biggest telecoms client on the continent. He said, “This enabled me to gain insight into how Africans use technology, and how they could get even more utility from technology and innovation in the digital space. I see our role as strategists as one that can help simplify digital transformation and concepts like 4IR for ordinary people through co-creating products and services with our clients to show the true value of technology, whilst helping our clients achieve growth.” The agency prides itself on its well balanced and diverse leadership team. Moalusi explained that the agency talent possesses unique skills and expertise, and they work collaboratively to drive business and brand growth. She said, “We work in a highly competitive industry, and while we aim to add value in our everyday interactions with our clients, simplify the complexities of a technology-driven world and create work that resonates with audiences and users, we always aspire to grow our people in the process to enable them to thrive, too. We’re organising ourselves in a way that enables us to assemble teams that complement each other and build an agency brand that becomes synonymous with the best digital, tech and creative solutions in South Africa.”“I’ve been exposed to diverse industries that have experienced major changes or disruptions and need to shift their focus to innovate and drive the adoption of new technologies, so I’ve had the privilege of seeing things from multiple vantage points. I look forward to sharing this perspective and my learnings with the team at Wunderman Thompson and most importantly to deliver on our mission to unlock growth for our clients' brands and businesses,” concluded Bodibe.
