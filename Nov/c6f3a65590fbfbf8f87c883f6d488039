Brave Group is proud to introduce its new flexible leave system: unlimited leave. With a growing number of corporate companies adopting this open and transparent approach to vacation time and leave, the Brave Group is thrilled that our new employee benefit will contribute to the organisation's talent acquisition and retention strategy and empower our pride with more time to also do life.  The new policy will be implemented on 1 December 2019, and all directors and employees who have been with the agency for the three years, will have unlimited annual leave granted to them year-on-year. Lebo Masilela, Human Capital Executive at Brave Group, says that the adoption of the new Unlimited Annual Leave policy is an incredible feat, particularly for a company whose business of constant interaction, ideation and client service requires extensive time investment from our employees. "The advertising industry has always managed to build and maintain a reputation of being one that gives employees the balance for both work and play. We're regularly interfacing and working with the Millenial and Gen Z generations so it's about time that our way of doing business reflect the new reality: encouraging wellness, downtime, and most importantly, being employers who initiate an open and trusting relationship with employees." Employee wellness and mental health is a crucial objective for the Brave Group as the company believes that employees with a holistic sense of purpose outside their profession, in turn contribute to improved productivity and efficiency, and are driven to create more inspired work.  "This is a step in the right direction to implementing new ways of working in the digital era and the beginning of a Brave new world for us in the agency and the industry," concludes Masilela.All qualifying Brave Group employees have already received updates and rollout details of how the new policy will work, and the Unlimited Annual Leave has already been included in all Brave Group's HR and admin systems.
