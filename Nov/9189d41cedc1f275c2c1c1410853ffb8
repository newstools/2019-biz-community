To maintain gender balance, space is limited to 50 female-identifying and 50 male-identifying individuals who are agency decision-makers, with an equal 50/50 representation of speakers. Prospective attendees must register and be screened before ticket purchase. The summit’s closed-door and limited-attendee format is designed to encourage open and honest conversation.“As a global nonprofit organisation, we have a long-standing commitment to giving back to the industry and providing programs that help improve the industry's diversity and gender equality,” said Kevin Swanepoel, CEO, The One Club, who will also speak at the summit. The ad industry has a gender bias problem, and institutional change will happen only when it comes from management. We’re starting Right The Ratio to stimulate dialogue among agency leaders and make that change happen.For more information and to apply, please click here.
