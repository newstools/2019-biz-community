I briefly chatted to Vacchiano for an update as to how this year's results compare to the last one (the study takes place every two years). .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}What can we expect from this year's findings.We are very proud because we got to interview more people, especially more people from larger companies. The sample was already very robust but now it's even bigger. We interviewed 257 professionals from 207 companies. That's from the marketing side. We also interviewed top procurement directors. We kept analysing with them and asked how they select agencies, how they work with agencies. We're happy to know that they are working for longer periods of time with agencies - about 5 years for creative agencies and 4-7 years for media agencies. They are also investing more in marketing and communications. Every R100 they sell they invest R4.3 in marketing and communications, so 4.3% of their sales are invested in marketing, which is good. In South Africa, clients invest more intensively in marketing and communications. That's because they think it will bring effectiveness and growth for the business. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1711/419664-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Scopenâ€™s global CEO Cesar Vacchiano and Johanna McDowell of IAS." width="120" height="120">Getting to grips with the Scopen Agency Scope 2017The results of the second edition of the Scopen Agency Scope are in!

They work on average with big creative agencies and some media agencies. They are now more interested in going back to basics with regards to creativity and account service. It's key that agencies also focus not only on demonstrating creativity but also demonstrating the effectiveness of that creativity.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/515898-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Cristina de los Santos on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Agency Scope South Africa 2019 trends: Evolution or revolution?

We help them understand why their offering is not as attractive as it should be or marketable overall. So if they don't understand that, it is very difficult to grow their business. More importantly, it's valuable because we share with them what their current plan is, where their weaknesses are and what the areas are where they need to improve. The study is important for agencies to understand the challenges we have nowadays so that agencies can adapt their services and their offerings to meet those needs of actual clients. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517013-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Ramiro Martinez on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Agency Scope South Africa 2019 trends: Evolution or revolution?
