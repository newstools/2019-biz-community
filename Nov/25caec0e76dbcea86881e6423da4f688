The main culprit for retailers losing in-store purchases to online shopping is due to issues with inventory management, particularly out-of-stocks.  Both shoppers and retail associates expressed dissatisfaction with the number of out-of-stocks as 43% of retail associates cited customer complaints about out-of-stocks as their biggest frustration and 39% of shoppers left the store without a purchase due to this problem. Self-checkout technologies are also gaining traction in retail stores as 40% of shoppers reported using these solutions within the last six months and 86% stated comfort with the technology. Furthermore, most shoppers (58%) – especially millennials (70%) – agree that self-checkout provides an improved customer experience.  The majority of store associates (54%) also said staffed checkout areas are less necessary with new technology that automates the process. Nearly nine-in-10 retail executives (87%) believe self-checkout frees up store associates to better serve customers, and 81% reported they’re starting to see a return on their investment.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519485-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Getty" width="120" height="120">Equip retail staff to be brand ambassadors and boost your bottom lineMost shopping still happens in-store rather than online, but it is clear that online shopping is a significant growth engine so stores need to do more to drive footfall...By Mark Thomson 3 Oct 2019 Better customer experience“Our study shows that while better services will help retain current shoppers and attract new ones, retailers need to make sure they have the basics right when it comes to product availability, ease of finding products, returns and exchanges,” said Anees Haidri, director of global retail market strategy, Zebra Technologies.  “To win with shoppers today, retailers must deliver a seamless, multi-channel experience that customers expect and leverage technology to provide more personalised services for managing inventory and building smarter operations.” Providing better customer experience will be crucial to keep shoppers coming back, but a significant disconnect exists between the expectations of retail executives and shoppers.
