<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/528701-625x297.png" alt="Workbench and Cricket South Africa part ways" width="625" height="297">Over the past five years, Workbench has been responsible for the strategy and creative development of cricket’s most powerful brands – with the exception of the Mzansi Super League, which was managed by another of CSA’s agency partners. Workbench is proud of the work done for #ProteaFire, Cricket South Africa’s “That’s Our Game” campaign, Pink Day and the Proteas women’s team, as well as the various domestic competitions over the seasons. The agency was involved at the inception of the Proteas men’s #ProteaFire brand and were integral to the creation of the brand for the national women’s team. They were responsible for the lovable That’s Our Game work that invited all to enjoy South Africa’s favourite summer pastime. Furthermore, they were responsible for consolidating and amplifying the Pink Day brand, CSA’s marquee event, amongst other campaigns. Workbench leaves the relationship with CSA extremely proud of the work they created throughout the successful partnership - with the notable accolades won over the years at the Sports Industry awards in recognition of the passion and expertise displayed by the agency whilst working on the account. Workbench agency MD, Mike Cook says, “While we’re disappointed at not having the contract renewed, we’d like to take this opportunity to wish the new structures all the best, and we hope they will build on the legacy we helped start and built. It was our privilege and honour to help create and look after their brands.” The twice extended retainer came to an end at the end of July, after the 2019 ICC Cricket World Cup. Martin Sing, co-founder of Workbench says, “The #IWillNotBeNext campaign for the Proteas Women and CSA was our only significant project post the ICC Cricket World Cup. It was good that we were able to develop the platform for the team, providing them the opportunity to add their voices, before the end of our contract, to one of South Africa’s most important conversations”. Mike Cook goes on to say, “Although CSA has been a valued client of the Workbench, we’re excited about what the next few months hold for us. We’ve recently been awarded business from Mukuru, FMI (a Division of Bidvest Life Ltd) and Avon amongst others, so we’re looking forward to what we can bring to their brands. The absence of CSA means there is space for us to partner with more clients, who can benefit from our strategic creativity over the long-term. Our strategic ability combined with great creative and agility have made a difference to CSA. We’re excited to pour that energy into other businesses and brands.”Who is Workbench:Workbench is a full service, through-the-line marketing communications agency based in Johannesburg with clients in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban as well as the UK and Philippines.
