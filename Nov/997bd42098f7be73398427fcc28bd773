Bread is the most consistent and common grocery item in many South African families. A day is started with either toast or a sandwich – which makes this an important staple in most homes.A savings culture is also needed among South African children (and adults) to show them that it is wise to save than to consume. Statistics about the country’s savings culture show a sad picture for most South Africans, one that suggests most people won’t retire comfortably.Children learn from what you do, where actions are often copied and repeated by young ones. It is evident in this TV commercial by Blue Ribbon, which shows the need to teach children the importance of saving – even in the smallest ways.In this ad, a boy saved for a loaf of bread, planned an indoor picnic and prepared a mouth-watering sandwich which he shared with his mother. He wanted to show her how much she is valued and appreciated. The mother’s approval and appreciation mean the world to the boy in this commercial.In a nutshell, parents play an important role in children’s lives. Blue Ribbon doesn’t only show a brand that is synonymous with South Africa’s staple food, it also highlights the importance of having elders who care and who are present in a child’s life.Agency and team creditsAd title: Share That Mmmm Yum TasteCountry: South AfricaClient: creative agency Mortimer HarveyAccount manager: Siphiwe Mpeta (Mortimer Harvey)Executive creative director: Ntsiki Nukwa (Mortimer Harvey)Creative director: Mark Stoner and Matthew CooperCopywriter: Mark Stoner (Mortimer Harvey)Art director: Matthew Cooper (Mortimer Harvey)Strategy: Selema Makgothi-Masekela (Mortimer Harvey)TV production: Denys Webb (Gravitate)Media planners: M&C SaatchiProduction company: Gravitate (Gravitate)Executive producer: Denys Webb (Gravitate)Music and sound design: Hein Brouwer (Gravitate)Agency producer: Karolin Steenekamp (Mortimer Harvey)Director: Stafford RobinsonDirector of photography: Clive de KlerkProduction art director: Massimo Bastiotto (Black Maverick Media)Editor: Sipho Cele (Gravitate)Post-production: GravitateStills photographer: Jurie PotgieterIf you are an agency or brand with work that’s on TV, please tweet us on @OrnicoMedia and add #AfricanAdShowcase.
