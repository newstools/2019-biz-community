Paid media contributes, on average, 25% to overall ROIEnsuring your brand invests in the right paid for media touchpoints is key to unlocking future growth. The following insights are based on Kantar’s Connect Database which looks at touchpoint contributions across hundreds of studies from various categories. Fuelled by technological innovation, there are multiple new ways for brands to communicate and interact with consumers. Every consumer experience has the potential to change their attitude and behaviour towards your brand and yet budgets and resources simply cannot cover all touchpoints. This means it is more important than ever to pinpoint the moments that matter for your customers; to ensure your brand is confidently investing in touchpoints that will drive your brand’s ROI. “In this digital age we’re producing thousands of new ads, posts, tweets, every week, every month, every year. We eventually concluded all we were doing was adding to the noise”. As pointed out by Marc Pritchard, CMO of Procter & Gamble (P&G), in an effort to keep up and be present at as many touchpoints as possible, the quality and consistency of communication suffered. In addition, the pressure to make use of algorithms and other “shiny” tools meant brand managers felt increasingly out of touch with their brands. In Marc Pritchard’s words: “We relinquished too much control”. So how can brand managers get back in the driving seat and bring their brand up –to –speed? To answer this question, Kantar analysed more than 270,000 touchpoint experiences in over 450 Connect touchpoint studies worldwide.Three key strategies were identified that help brands find extraordinary growth:1. Do fewer things, but excellently 2. Find brand growth beyond paid media 3. Leave a unique brand footprint1. DO FEWER THINGS, BUT EXCELLENTLYBrands have more ways than ever to reach consumers. However, to maximise ROI, brands should identify the key touchpoints that deliver the majority of brand impact, and learn from competitors to optimise these touchpoints. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527454.png" alt="Which touchpoints deliver the most brand ROI?" width="443" height="205">Case study: coffee brandsTo illustrate this point, we draw on a touchpoint study in the coffee category, coffee drinkers aged 20 to 65 years. In this case study there were 43 touchpoints where consumers might potentially experience a brand, including traditional paid touchpoints (such as TV advertising), owned touchpoints (such as the shelf presence or website), as well as earned touchpoints (such as word of mouth). Analysis showed that the top 10 most impactful touchpoints contributed 81% of brand impact. The remaining 30 touchpoints had little or no impact in the category. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527455-625x320.png" alt="Which touchpoints deliver the most brand ROI?" width="625" height="320" rel="">click to enlarge2. FIND BRAND GROWTH BEYOND PAID MEDIAConsumers interact with brands across many touchpoints outside of media, including touchpoints before, during and after purchase, paid media touchpoints, owned touchpoints and earned touchpoints. One of the amazing findings of our more than 150 Connect studies is that brand building is not a matter of paid media alone. Paid media only contributes 25% to the overall brand equity and yet, many companies are optimising their media performance only. By doing so brands have a blind spot for all the other touchpoints that contribute 75% to the brand.  <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527457-625x353.png" alt="Which touchpoints deliver the most brand ROI?" width="625" height="353" rel="">click to enlargeConnect your audience with relevant channelsAny well –planned campaign starts with your target market which is even more crucial when deploying multiple media channels. Get to know your audience, understand exactly who they are and what they’re looking for. Different media will reach different audience segments and produce different responses. You can improve your overall media performance by understanding your audience’s receptivity to each touchpoint in their journey to purchasing your product. 3. LEAVE A UNIQUE BRAND FOOTPRINTFrom case studies across South Africa, the importance of non paid-for media touchpoints is irrefutableAlthough this does vary by category, more than two thirds of brand ROI is driven by non-media touchpoints. In retail, for example, non-media (elements such as store layout and in store experience for example) contribute almost 20% more to brand ROI than telecommunications, so understanding category nuance is key in optimising media strategy. What works in one category will not necessarily translate into another. Regardless of categories across paid media touchpoints, TV continues to dominate importance. When looking at the importance of social media platforms combined with other digital advertising, investment across the digital ecosystem will undoubtedly deliver brand ROI. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527459-625x269.png" alt="Which touchpoints deliver the most brand ROI?" width="625" height="269" rel="">click to enlargeNot all touchpoints deliver the same impact across brands, thus understanding impact for your brand vs. Key competitors is key in optimising future strategy <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527461-625x372.png" alt="Which touchpoints deliver the most brand ROI?" width="625" height="372" rel="">click to enlargeWhilst it is key for media planners and strategists to ensure the most relevant touchpoints are included in a media plan, touch point selection alone will not automatically guarantee great brand ROI. The impact of touchpoints varies across brands. In the above graph every dot represents one brand. For every one of these brands, their touchpoint experience has a different impact on overall brand ROI – it can be positive (green part of the Y-axis) or negative (yellow part of the Y-axis). Looking on the left side: we see TV advertisement for some brands work really well, but for others TV is not working at all, the same distribution can be observed across touchpoints. The key factor of determining the extent of a touchpoint’s contribution to overall brand ROI is the quality of the creative. Cut-through creative will result in higher touchpoint contribution whereas poor-quality creative will, in some instances, result in negative brand ROI. It is the combination of relevant touchpoints and quality creative that determines whether or not the brand ROI is maximised. HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?
