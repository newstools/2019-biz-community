There are now more than 80,000 creatives and thousands of companies hiring from the platform globally.WNW’s Tompkins said the organisation has always had a close relationship with the ADC brand, from partner Gignac being named a Young Guns 5 winner to its early days when the WNW team would promote ADC parties and attend its awards shows.“The stamp of industry respect that comes with an ADC Cube was definitely something we strived for when starting Working Not Working and curating our community,” said Tompkins.
