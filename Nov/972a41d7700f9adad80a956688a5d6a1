Throughout the past year we have really made it one of our biggest priorities to touch as many lives as possible through community outreach. We’ve awarded bursaries at all levels of education, assisted those in need of medical attention and helped victims of unforeseen, life-changing circumstances. However, in order to continue doing this, we need to raise vital funds through initiatives like our Hot Cares Teddy-thon. You can pledge on the day by phoning in 010 035 0919, visit our website and pledge online or come down to Sandton City and pledge in person (snapscan and credit card facilities available).Catch Jeremy Mansfield and the Mansfield in the Morning team, Mark Pilgrim, Bunny Majaja and Tony Murrell, before welcoming The Big Joburg Drive to end the celebration. Join us throughout the day where we will be sharing the stage with fantastic performances by, Beverley Jane, Pedro Barbosa, RJ Benjamin, Milho Ramai, Daniel Baron and the ultimate party band Dr Victor & Rasta Rebels.It is with great delight that we welcome some of the Emirates Lions players to the event where they will be manning the lines and posing for photos with fans!You are invited to make your pledge and join the Hot 91.9FM team at the 2019 Teddy-thon! Please help us raise the bar yet again!
