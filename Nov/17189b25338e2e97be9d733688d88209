The webinars will be co-hosted by digital industry giants Adobe and Marketo, and promise to change the way businesses sell and market themselves. “When it comes to sales and marketing, B2B clients are becoming more sophisticated in their expectations, and businesses from around the world are struggling to meet them.” says Jos Caelers, CEO at Engagement Factory. “We wanted to show them that these expectations are actually an opportunity, and not a threat. That’s why we’ve invited our partner companies Adobe, Marketo and Showpad to share their success and educate others how to do the same.” Marketo’s webinar is set for launch on 20 November. It aims to align marketing and sales teams to intelligently nurture new prospects through marketing automation. They plan to demonstrate how to accomplish this through proven goal-oriented focus techniques that centre around the customer’s journey. “Marketo and Adobe know what they’re doing because their entire business centres around generating personalised, one-to-one connections with leads - and companies are taking notice,” says Caelers. “We’ve already received such a positive response from around the world, that our webinars are filling up pretty quickly.” Adobe’s webinar on 4 December will discuss how to get noticed and generate attendee engagement at live networking events. They also aim to educate companies on how to convert leads into conversions through practical examples, tools and methods designed to work for a multitude of industries in the B2B sector.“We are really excited to help educate businesses on the best-practices for customer engagement from some of the biggest names in the industry. If businesses can get on the same page as their clients and understand what they want, everybody wins,” concludes Caelers.If you would like to find out more, sign up on Engagement Factory’s events page or contact Engagement Factory for more information.
