She is currently the director for local interest channels at M-Net.7 Mar 2014Phahle set the context for her talk by commenting that countries like Mexico, Turkey and Scandinavia have had great economic success in bringing local films and TV series to the global market. Now, Phahle says it’s time for South Africa to do the same. We can also deliver incredible economic benefits, and African storytelling can find a home in the hearts and minds of global audiences.Phahle picked up a common thread throughout AfricaCom 2019’s keynote sessions – the power of collaboration and synergy. This is clearly seen in MultiChoice’s coproduction with HBO’s Cinemax, which is set to broadcast Trackers across most global territories.Tracking local storytelling successBased on the Deon Meyer-written classic novel of the same name, Phahle said Trackers is an African story breaking all the records M-Net has set over the years.They interrupted regular scheduling for this locally produced drama with an almost 100% South African cast, made with a local production crew. The Trackers series has created more than 1,000 jobs and attracted millions in foreign investment in South Africa, so Phahle says to imagine the power of local productions on job creation if this was done at scale.Piwe Motshegoa, head of sales: general entertainment at DStv media sales said it best during the DStv Seminar of Creativity, a highlight of Loeries Creative Week: “As Africans, we need to remember that we are the ones we have been waiting for.”<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513194-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Piwe Motshegoa, head of sales: general entertainment at DStv media sales.

There’s proof we can do it, but we need a national agenda to make this work. Giving clout to her story, Phahle shared that Lebo M, who famously created music for the Disney Lion King, has spoken out many times on the economic value that was lost to Africa in having this story told by a global entertainment brand rather than having it produced by an African studio. Phahle says the same can be said of Marvel’s Black Panther – we need to make sure the next African superhero story is told by an African studio, so those taxes and revenues flow where they’re most needed in Africa.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/513045-120x120.png?2" alt="Uzoma Ukah," width="120" height="120">The rise and rise of 'Wakanda' marketingWith Black Panther came a new kind of storytelling: one that celebrated cultural backgrounds and strengths...By Uzoma Ukah 22 Aug 2019The African animation opportunityPhahle commented that animation also lovely to watch, but she notes that on average, it takes around 300 animators to produce a feature-length film. In addition, it’s difficult for students to imagine how to gain the skills to learn to create this form of entertainment. That’s where Cape Town-based Triggerfish comes in. The award-winning academy has partnered with Disney before and has partnered with the German Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development in launching the Triggerfish academy. This free digital learning platform is set to become one of the prime guides into the craft for the next generation.The Triggerfish Story Lab is doing so well that its shows often feature on Showmax, and Netflix has just picked up its first children’s animation series that’s for Africa, by Africa, about an all-girl group of Zambian spies.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496872-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Scenes from Mama K’s Super 4." width="120" height="120">#AfricaMonth: Anyone from anywhere can be a superheroThe likes of Black Panther have turned the concept of Wakanda from a dream to reality for superhero fans across the continent, but that's only the starting point of African creativity.

We also need continued access to broadband, and as broadband prices fall, we can better reach the people who want to hear our stories.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525896-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Scanlan presenting at AfricaCom 2019." width="120" height="120">#AfricaCom: How to accelerate digital transformation to 5G the right wayThe 22nd edition of Africacom took place from 12 to 14 November 2019 at the CTICC in Cape Town.

And how significant will its impact on the Nigerian film industry be?...By Alessandro Jedlowski 31 Dec 2018Looking at film success further across the continent, Phahle shared that we can’t ignore the success of Nigeria’s Nollywood, which is expected to bring in $1 billion a year in export revenue next year, with mobile phone viewers spending approximately $2bn a year watching local content.Little wonder then that the Nigerian film industry provides employment to close to 2-million people, having worked hard to put systems in place that directly support that industry.Nollywood is so successful, in fact, as the sixth biggest film industry in the world at present, that it’s often referred to in the same hallowed tones as that of Hollywood and India’s Bollywood. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/507153-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Lanre Adisa, CEO/CCO of Noah's Ark Communications, Nigeria, and Loeries 2019 Live, PR and OOH juror." width="120" height="120">#Loeries2019: "No place for one-size-fits-all in truly relatable regional storytelling" - Lanre AdisaWith the year's biggest international award shows done and dusted, I chatted to the regional jurors ahead of the upcoming Loeries Creative Week.

Who’s going to bring Siya Kolisi’s phenomenal life journey to the screen?Telling local success stories in a local voiceI hope it comes from South Africans, as we really don’t want an African American actor twanging his way through the scrum, or Matt Damon playing Faf du Plessis. No disrespect to Invictus… but surely it’s time for South Africa and Africa to bring more of our own stories to the world stage and screen?Unfortunately, this will only happen if we see consistent and growing involvement in the South African creative arts, by government and the private sector alike. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519898-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato." width="120" height="120">City of Cape Town plans to further back local film industry with a film fundTo provide further support for the local film industry, the City of Cape Town has announced its plan to launch a film fund...7 Oct 2019Phahle says the biggest and most influential economies in the world all have strong film and television industries, which are a huge part of their national identity and their content travels the world. That’s why she feels film often has more impact on the national psyche than politics, and those stories often contribute more to democracy, social cohesion and personal development. Just think of the impact of the film The Color Purple on young black women’s lives, or how An Inconvenient Truth got us all thinking of climate change. Locally, think of how the Yizo Yizo series reflected hard-hitting daily struggles that are a reality for youth living on the margins of society.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1112/89321-120x120.jpg" alt="Educational broadcasting in SA: resonance and interactivity" width="120" height="120">Educational broadcasting in SA: resonance and interactivitySouth African audiences were shocked and amazed when a previously unseen form of programming hit the small screen between 3 February 1999 and March 2001. The SABC's Yizo Yizo combined gritty documentary with a soap-opera format. What stands out is the combination of its educational format with the explicit depiction of criminal and sexual encounters and use of vulgar language.By Matt Rose 5 Dec 2011That’s why Phahle feels a massive stimulus package for the local filmmaking industry would undoubtedly speed up transformation, build up the economy and simultaneously strengthen national consciousness.There’s never been a better time in history to be a ‘storyteller’Earlier this year, the MultiChoice Talent Factory’s academic director Femi Odugbemi highlighted the tremendous opportunities that exist right now because of advances in technology, which Phahle feels we should bear in mind as we approach a new future for all involved in creating content in this new technological environment. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/509345-120x120.jpg" alt="Yolisa Phahle, CEO of general entertainment for MultiChoice Group." width="120" height="120">Africa is a great repository for untapped and untold storiesA diverse and culturally rich African continent is a bedrock for storytelling...By Yolisa Phahle 30 Jul 2019Phahle quoted Odugbemi from the Lagos International Animation Festival, where he said:The creative industries across the world are in the midst of a pivotal shift, driven by emerging technologies. The extraordinary growth of digital devices, platforms, apps and games has created amazing ways for people to connect with each other and with new ideas and concepts and to share data and content in user-friendly ways.This appetite for content is creating new opportunities for digitally-driven storytelling that Nollywood needs to embrace. Because content is the foundation of the audience’s ‘connected experience,’ the challenge for Nollywood’s future is how to leverage every available technology to deliver generation-next content that creates compelling experiences. We need to start distilling the trends that will fundamentally transform how this content is created, distributed and consumed in the immediate future. Odugbemi concluded that there’s never been a better time in history to be a ‘storyteller,’” and Phahle firmly agrees.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1805/442945-120x120.png" alt="Tell authentic African stories by empowering content producers" width="120" height="120">Tell authentic African stories by empowering content producersMultiChoice Africa announces Pan-African initiative for film and television industry, to ignite Africa's creative industries...31 May 2018Artificial intelligence and machine learning lets us dub and subtitle South African content into pretty much any of the worlds’ thousands of spoken languages. The same technology enables us to better understand what audiences like and want, while audience algorithms help us to define in advance what works and doesn’t, and to continually improve the potential impact of our work.But we can’t achieve any of this if we are only inward-looking. We need to work together and collaborate, in order to realise and release the full potential of South Africa’s and Africa’s creative industries.Shaka Zulu: Possibly the greatest African story of all time…Phahle was applauded by the audience for her final point, that if there’s one South African as well known as Nelson Mandela, it’s Shaka Zulu.His tale means so many things to so many people, as his story is one of courage, intrigue and love. Shaka Zulu can be said to have inspired every nation that has fought against colonialism and in defence of land and heritage.It’s possibly the greatest African story of all time and appeals globally, and while there have been previous attempts to tell the story, Phahle was proud to announce the following:Not only are they leveraging digital and human capabilities in taking great African story to the world and retelling it locally, but they’re also making history and encouraging the continent to tell our own history, in our own way.
