<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525887-625x303.jpg" alt="OFM reaches out to drought-suffering farmers" width="625" height="303">Many areas in the OFM footprint is experiencing one of the worst droughts in more than a century with the Northern Cape and far-flung western regions of North West suffering the most.  In addition, drought conditions have prevailed for the past five years, resulting in a devastating knock-on effect on agriculture, the rural economy and social welfare of residents.According to a report from the Northern Cape Early Warning Committee, farmers are so indebted that they cannot secure loans to buy feed to keep their animals alive. Farm workers are increasingly at risk of losing their jobs and many rural businesses are battling to keep their doors open. In many farming communities, children are taken out of school because their parents cannot afford transport costs. The report states that even if rains come and provide relief, it will take another five years for farmers and the land to recuperate.Seeing as these regions are the heartbeat of OFM’s listenership, the radio station feels compelled to assist in helping these communities in the Free State, Northern Cape and North West. Therefore, the station has created a page to share what is happening around Central South Africa in relation to helping farmers in need.Says Lindiwe Mtwentula, OFM Marketing Manager: “OFM has created a platform where we can share credible and verified projects to assist struggling farmers in our area. These vary from food, clothes, animal feed and money. There are so many ways to get involved and we urge our listeners to open their hearts and help the people who are responsible for our food security.”“It is a sad state of affairs in our beautiful Central South Africa. As the leading media hub; it is our responsibility to carry a message of hope to our farmers and ask our audiences to assist where they can. If we work together, we will make a material difference,” says Nick Efstathiou, CEO of OFM’s holding company, the Central Media Group.Some of the projects listed include the Agri Northern Cape Drought Relief Fund, the Boks vir ‘n Boervrou and Braaibroodjie vir 'n Boer projects, Gift of the Givers and Golfers are Givers projects, to name few.
