The assessment of the TV channel by Multichoice (DSTV) is underway. The signing of the contract and launch of the channel will be done after the assessment which is expected to lapse at the end of November.”Senator Mutsvangwa said the outdoor public viewing screen installed at the Nyika growth point in Bikita would access television services while informing the community. “To date, roofing sheets and the sound system for the OPVS has been procured. The project team is set to travel to Bikita at the end of November 2019 and will transport roofing sheets and electronic components for the OPVS. The team is expected to roof the OPVS, carry out electrical fittings as well as configure and test run the system. Connection to the national three-phase grid electricity will also be pursued with Bikita Rural District Council and Zesa.”The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Services has also been successful in meeting the targets set for the installation of FM filler filters, which will improve radio reception in Tugwi Mukosi and Madlambuzi.“The Ministry of Information was seized with providing a solution for radio reception for Madlambuzi(Matebeleland South) and Tugwi Mukosi(Masvingo). By day 50 of the cycle (4th November 2019) transmitter equipment and shelter for Madlambuzi had been delivered and subsequently installed at the site. Equipment delivery and installation at Tugwi Mukosi was done after day 50 of the cycle had lapsed as a result of challenges in accessing the remote site. To date, the project is complete at the two sites with the Madlambuzi community receiving the National FM signal while Tugwi Mukosi is receiving Radio Zimbabwe signal.”The minister also said that construction of a high-definition (HD) television studio for independent producers would increase awareness and appreciation of Zimbabwean culture through the production of local content.Source: NexTVAfrica.com.
