Moderator Terryanne Chebet is currently general manager at Metropol TV, the first Kenyan 24-hour business news channel, which launched earlier this year.Giving young people new entrepreneurial heroes to look up toChebet commented at the time that Metropol TV offered new dawn and a breath of fresh air to business reporting in the country, as business journalism has grown beyond the five-minute segments we were used to, as demand for information rises.We are launching Metropol TV and we hope to deliver business news that will empower our audiences to make sound economic decisions. Through our programming, young people will get new heroes, like wealth creators, entrepreneurs and people of integrity. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/490413-120x120.jpg" alt="Image source: Gallo/Getty." width="120" height="120">First 24-hour Kenyan TV business channel launchesMetropol Corporation launches 24-hour business TV channel, Metropol TV...2 Apr 2019Commenting on the digital economy, Carole Wamuyu Wainaina, chief operating officer of Africa50, spoke of infrastructure development in Africa, which plays an important role as a platform that brings together industry players.But it’s important to recognise that’s just one part of the solution. We shouldn’t focus on any single aspect independently of understanding the rest of the value chain. Africa's most wanted: Infrastructure and jobsWainaina commented that as the infrastructure fund for Africa, Africa50 is funded by African governments in a way that a purely commercial organisation would not be able to, which means they bring together the players in a unique way.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1807/449446-120x120.jpg" alt="Alain Ebobissé is the CEO of Africa50." width="120" height="120">The recipe for long-term growth in AfricaImproved infrastructure is a prerequisite for long-term sustainable growth and development in Africa...By Alain Ebobissé 18 Jul 2018Chebet used this as a segue to introduce the topic of a pan-African digital strategy, to which Juliet Ehimuan, country director for Google Nigeria said technology would play an important role in accelerating growth, as African’s biggest challenges simply won’t be solved without further innovation. We will come by those solutions by working with different partners and pillars, in order to energise the digital value chain.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1708/405787-120x120.jpg" alt="Sundar Pichai, Google CEO, at Google for Nigeria event in Lagos." width="120" height="120">Google commits to preparing 10m in Africa for future jobsGoogle is committed to preparing 10 million people for the jobs of the future in the next five years, making the internet work better for everyone in Africa...By Juliet Ehimuan-Chiazor 11 Aug 2017Charlene Verzmoter, head of philanthropy at Microsoft, said she’s excited about the fourth industrial revolution or 4IR as technology is at the heart of the revolution. Industrial revolutions = societal change. Are we ready?There was rapid societal change with the first three industrial revolutions, but Verzmoter says there’s never been as much as what we are seeing currently.  It’s the ultimate opportunity, with the potential to drive Africa’s economic growth forward through new business opportunities.Isabel dos Santos, chair of Unitel in Angola, congratulated Chebet for moderating an all-female panel in the tech realm, stating that she’s often been the only female voice on discussion panels in the past. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1801/425820-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Original image © ." width="120" height="120">#FairnessFirst: Amplifying the female voiceThe first work week of 2018 for many was also one where we heard the global female voice loud and clear on social media, with 'celebration emojis' for everything from Iceland's equal pay law to #HereWeAre, #TimesUp and #Oprah2020...By Leigh Andrews 15 Jan 2018Dos Santos spoke of her experience from the mobile operating company perspective and how it was already radically different from most tech industries back in the day.Mobile in Africa: Beyond voiceAs Africa is mobile-first, and in some places mobile-only, we're already going ‘beyond voice’ when it comes to mobile. It’s also about delivering data at high speed, as data can really change the face of business.

The current focus is on putting lots of investment into broadband and access to connectivity, which is crucial, but said Africa50’s aim is also to work with governments in public-private partnership (PPP) frameworks, as this is the best vehicle to attract international investors. We recognise that it’s a slow process in the rural and under-served areas, so need to start crowdsourcing solutions.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/518592.jpg" alt="Tackling the high unemployment rate of the 'Generation Disrupted'" width="120" height="120">Tackling the high unemployment rate of the 'Generation Disrupted'Increasingly frustrated and disillusioned by the lack of jobs, many young South Africans are creating employment opportunities for themselves...By Liezl Rees & Nikitta Hahn, Issued by Johannesburg Business School 27 Sep 2019Within this innovation challenge, Wainaina says that once we get the solutions, we can work with the winners to finance them and help to scale. They’re currently piloting a project in Rwanda that’s funded by 28 countries, to help with the hardcore infrastructure as well as last-mile connectivity and modular solutions.Scale beyond a drop in the oceanSpeaking on the topic of scale, Ehimuan said there are many exciting initiatives where entrepreneurs are doing big things, but on a continent with more than 1.2bn people, that effort can seem like a drop in the ocean.That’s why she says we need to think of scale early, in the design phase, and to scale around the rate of development. That’s where the country’s numerous tech and entrepreneurial hubs come in. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1806/445137-120x120.jpg" alt="Innovation labs in Africa have doubled" width="120" height="120">Innovation labs in Africa have doubledThe African tech hubs pioneering innovation: How digital transformation can drive growth and job creation across emerging economies...15 Jun 2018When it comes to existing developments, remember that Africa is mobile-first, and in some places mobile-only, so any solutions must be mobile compatible.We also need to consider leveraging communities to scale, especially on topics like digital literacy. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/522723-120x120.jpg" alt="Frances Ahene-Affoh." width="120" height="120">Growing digital literacy in AfricaMeet the Ghanaian social enterprise driving digital literacy in one of Africa's fastest-growing economies...22 Oct 2019If we come together and collaborate on this, there’s potential to expand the pie. There’s no denying that basic survival is a reality for many when it comes to earning a living, so innovating around business models for the non-formal sector as well as in fintech to enhance financial inclusion for the unbanked is a good place to start.Digital inclusion, leave no one behindThere are also spots of radical advancement we can learn from, such as the use of machine learning in Tanzanian agriculture, for remote diagnosis of crop disease.On intentionality and the need to leave no one behind, Verzmoter says mobile penetration remains largely in urban areas.That’s why Microsoft has undertaken various programmes to empower communities more effectively. These include the Microsoft Cloud for Global Good, with a focus on the realms of earth, accessibility, aid and heritage. The Cloud for Global Good is about creating a trusted, responsible, and inclusive cloud, based on policy recommendations for governments, industry and civil society to help ensure that the opportunities of technology are evenly shared and that challenges facing society are identified early and practical solutions applied.On building businesses for tomorrow, Chebet said that in her time as a journalist in Kenya, much was done to celebrate the launch of M-Pesa, now a decade old.

What does the digital economy really mean in Africa?Does that mean digitising all the processes in our companies? Because all businesses need a chance to thrive, not just those in urban areas with established financial centres, as innovation is also changing traditional farming communities. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1708/406051-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Cash is no longer king.

Creating a positive environment for PPPsShe adds that we can’t connect our 54 non-viable ‘chunks of Africa’ into something powerful simply by optimising our digital connection as one. We need to look at how best to bring in the private sector, as they will invest where they see a return and will bring more money into the continent. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525896-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Scanlan presenting at AfricaCom 2019." width="120" height="120">#AfricaCom: How to accelerate digital transformation to 5G the right wayThe 22nd edition of Africacom took place from 12 to 14 November 2019 at the CTICC in Cape Town.

Most governments aren’t quite as business savvy as they should be. Business is driven by profit but in a good enough market, you need contractual security before you can commit to that, as well as an understanding of current market conditions and the ability to foresee what that market will be like down the road. These uncertainties are the current challenges we need to overcome in order to create a positive environment for PPPs.A big PPP will benefit the continent but Africa50 is a strategic minority, merely catalysing the private sector, and working on government enablement. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/526600-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#AfricaCom: Smartphone costs the biggest barrier to a digitally inclusive Africa" width="120" height="120">#AfricaCom: Smartphone costs the biggest barrier to a digitally inclusive AfricaThe next technological evolution is advancing at an exponential rate and by leaving out some on this journey, we allow the current societal divides and inequalities to deepen...By Sindy Peters 15 Nov 2019But let’s not try to run before we can walk, as Dos Santos points out that the current African population of 1.2bn is set to double to 2.4bn by 2050, and you just can’t have 5G if you don’t even have electricity.That’s why Dos Santos would like to see what happened in the telecom sector happen in the energy sector.We need to be aware of deepening the digital divide and further disrupting 'generation disrupted'.Predictions on Africa’s next digital decadeResponding to Chebet’s question of where Africa will be in the next 5 to 10 years from a digital perspective, Dos Santos said she expects to see the rise of African champions and big companies in this space. We haven’t yet seen the Amazon or Alibaba of Africa.Verzmoter has hope in the potential for growth but says a collaborative approach is needed to accelerate this. We need to learn from one another, as we are all facing similar issues and can scale and show impact by sharing stories.  Ehimuan concluded that technology allows us to accelerate those opportunities, while Al players in the ecosystem need to come together and be intentional in accelerating that growth. Wainaina is similarly excited about tech innovation, as she says we can only solve the continent’s tech problems with solutions that are specifically designed for what we need. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1903/487295-120x120.jpg" alt="Main challenges to inclusive growth, peace and security in Central Africa" width="120" height="120">Main challenges to inclusive growth, peace and security in Central Africa"Our future lies in regional integration.
