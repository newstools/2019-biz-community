View this post on Instagram           Because hindsight isn’t always 2020, this year we’re showing you great work that has earned accolades from your colleagues before they win. Launching next week, New York Festivals’ “Mad For This Ad” is an initiative celebrating great work by awarding free entries to ads chosen by a hand-picked group of top creatives. How’s it Work? Monday – We’ll announce the AdHunter. A Creative of note who has determinedly distinguished instincts. Tuesday – We’ll announce their ad of choice and point you to it for your own enjoyment. Wednesday – That ad will be awarded a free entry into the 2020 NYFA AWARDS. Stay tuned to our Social channels to get a peek at some good work, that some good people, think deserves a strong shout-out online and beyond. #MADFORTHISAD #NYFA2020 #NYFAdvertisingAwards2020 A post shared by  NYF Advertising Awards (@nyfadvertisingawards) on Oct 8, 2019 at 7:56am PDT The brainchild of advisory board member Fede Garcia, global ECD at Huge, the Mad For This Ad kicked off with Colenso BBDO’s “I’m Drinking It For You” – which was selected by VMLY&R global CCO Debbi Vandeven.A preview of what’s to come “Different expressions of creativity are what fuels us in this business. So, when Susan Glass Ruse and Scott Rose and the team at New York Festivals asked me to contribute to their newly-launched Mad For This Ad initiative, I thought it was a wonderful chance to honour a piece of work that recently captured my attention,” said Vandeven.The “I’m Drinking It For You” campaign is a valentine R&B music video created for Colenso BBDO’s client, DB Export’s low-carb beer. “NYFA is all about celebrating and rewarding great work. With Mad For This Ad, we get to do more of that before the competition even closes,” said Susan Glass Ruse, executive director, New York Festivals Advertising Awards.“Seeing a preview of creative work that’s impressing industry leaders before the awards season is an exciting indicator of what’s to come. The chosen campaigns are also rewarded with a free entry into NYFA, which is the icing on the cake.”SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/500681.jpg" alt="#CannesLions2019: &amp;quot;Frankness and a fresh perspective&amp;quot; - judging insights with Fran Luckin" width="120" height="120">#CannesLions2019: "Frankness and a fresh perspective" - judging insights with Fran LuckinThe Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity for 2019 kicks off next week, with winners announced at nightly awards from 17 to 21 June.

I've always felt that it's incredibly important to highlight and celebrate the kind of work that should inspire our industry. In trying to find an idea to celebrate work throughout the year, I worked with the team at the NYFA to find a way to regularly showcase the work that holds the level of excellence we should aspire to reach every day,” said Garcia. GLOBAL<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1905/496854-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The executive jury 2019 unwinding at the River Cafe, New York, after a week long exercise of judging and voting for the best entries. © ." width="120" height="120">Winners announced for 2019 NYF Advertising Awards!New York Festivals Advertising Awards has announced its 2019 winners...15 May 2019Every week, a handpicked globally-respected executive will serve as adhunter for NYF and choose an ad that captures their attention.NYF honours their selection with complimentary entry into the 2020 New York Festivals Advertising Awards and showcases the great work that has earned accolades from their colleagues.To view the weekly Mad For This Ad selection, click here.  The 2020 New York Festivals Advertising Awards deadline to enter is 16 December 2019.
