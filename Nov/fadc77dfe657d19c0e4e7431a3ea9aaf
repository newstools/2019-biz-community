But the most ominous change has happened stealthily and under cover of night: the gradual but steady elimination of risk. Many films today are perfect products manufactured for immediate consumption. Many of them are well made by teams of talented individuals. All the same, they lack something essential to cinema: the unifying vision of an individual artist. Because, of course, the individual artist is the riskiest factor of all.His basic argument is that as risk has been eliminated from film, and by risk he means smaller independent films and offbeat stories, it has been replaced by packaged formulas of certainty that are free of surprise or a strong point of view. As you begin to watch these films, you know what you will feel and how much you will feel. There is very little challenging the viewer.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/528294.jpg" alt="Martin Scorcese." width="625" height="753">Martin Scorcese.So, the question is, why does that matter? I am sure if you asked the producers on the Marvel films that have made millions of dollars, they would laugh at you through their cigar smoke.The simple answer is the word ‘pattern.’ Patterns are very useful and have enormous value. They are consistent and predictable. However, if they have one weakness it is they are very bad at creating anything new. They are very bad at changing how you see the world. And, importantly, they always have a sell-by date. So, could the big film studios be the next Kodak? <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1708/406556-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Maksym Chornii © –" width="120" height="120">#CEMAfrica2017: "Be an experience business or be out of business" - AdobeCEM Africa attendees were presented with a choice of workshops to attend throughout the two-day summit. Here's why I'm glad I went with the session by James McDonald, solution consultant at Adobe, on how to be an experience-driven business...By Leigh Andrews 17 Aug 2017An interesting question, especially if you look at where a lot of innovation and great storytelling is happening these days (Netflix, Apple, Amazon, HBO, etc).Risk, on the other hand, is very good at creating the new. Mr Scorsese argues in the article that Hollywood is now making the same film over and over. And, if you look at how many indistinguishable franchises there are in Hollywood these days, he may have a point. It has become a pattern that is predictable.Now, if you are a brave man or woman, you might argue Scorsese is old school and doesn’t get it.But, I would disagree. I think he gets something very important.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/528289.jpg" alt="elBulli" width="625" height="326">elBulliLike a great chef, he knows that risk is an ingredient that is required to make a new recipe. A great example of this is one of the world’s greatest chefs, Ferran Adria. He ran the globally renowned Michelin 3-star restaurant elBulli. Even though it was reported that the restaurant had a waiting list of a million people, elBulli would close for six months of the year because Chef Adria vowed never to repeat the dishes he created each year. This time allowed him to innovate and take new risks. Financially, it makes no sense but artistically, it does. You don’t get to greatness by doing the same thing over and over. He understood standing still leads to atrophy and eventually, death.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1202/94071-120x120.jpg" alt="I'll go where Hugo" width="120" height="120">I'll go where HugoIt's that time of the year again. No, I'm not talking about the surge of guilt over failed resolutions; I'm talking about the Oscars. The next several weeks will see a wave of great movies, somehow perfectly timed to coincide with the Academy Awards. Well, if Hugo is anything to go by, we're in for a grand time.By Eugene Yiga 14 Feb 2012I also think Mr Scorsese and Chef Adria fundamentally understand the difference between profit and growth.A pattern can make you a lot of money but only risk can give you exponential growth. Spiritually, artistically and financially. Only risk can help you see new things or make your world bigger. Risk can keep an industry alive. Risk can innovate and change the game. Risk can give you something that didn’t exist. Risk is very hard and scary and the only thing that can get you somewhere new. Risk is the alchemy we all believe in, but so few of us are brave enough to use.  This is a tension I have seen in many companies throughout my career. The need to change but being paralysed by the pattern that got you this far. I have spent countless hours in meetings that are pantomimes about changing without changing.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/506814-120x120.jpg?2" alt="What if nothing is changing?" width="120" height="120">What if nothing is changing?There is an advertising urban myth about a company needing to sell more baby powder.

I always wonder how many perished because of the risks they didn’t take.
