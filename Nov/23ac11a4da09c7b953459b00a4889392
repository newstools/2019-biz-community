We will decide to make our grudge purchases – of items such as household cleaning products and toilet paper – while the items are on sale or if there’s a special offer attached to these. This is human nature and is totally understandable.“In fact,” says Lisa Schneider: managing director of the Digital School of Marketing, “studies have proven that items which are priced, for example, at R99.95, record better sales than those that are priced at R100 even though there is a miniscule difference of 5 cents.”Education is not a nice-to-haveIn the latest statistics released, it was stated that the salaries of the middle class are increasingly being sliced up by more financial burdens. Costs such as medical aid are increasing exponentially however, salaries are not keeping up with these added burdens.“Unfortunately, continued education is something that is taken off the table as people simply can’t afford to pay the fees for courses at bricks-and-mortal institutions,” says Schneider. “Even though education will improve people’s lives in the long term, they are unable to afford the short-term outlay.”In the spirit of improving access to education, this Black Friday Week the Digital School of Marketing is discounting all of their online digital marketing courses by 50% if the upfront payment method is selected. This means that students will have access to essential digital marketing skills at a price that suits their pocket.
