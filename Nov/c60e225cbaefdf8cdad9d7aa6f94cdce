We are delighted to present this inaugural recognition to Minister Stella Ndabeni-Abrahams, South Africa’s Minister of Communications and Digital Technologies, in honour of her efforts to break the barriers of connectivity in South Africa and her efforts to promote an inclusive connected society.Minister Ndabeni-Abrahams who had been invited to give the welcoming address to the assembled guests, graciously accepted the award, also expressing gratitude on behalf of the South African Government, to the organisers of AfricaCom for once again bringing the leading tech conference to the country. She remarked:At the heart of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4R) is people. Therefore it has been encouraging to note that the discussions, various technologies and innovations showcased during AfricaCom, have primarily centred on technology as an enabler for socio-economic development. We were further encouraged by the collaborations between various organisations in developing solutions. This is consistent with our mantra, ‘Coordinate. Collaborate. Execute 4IR’, which means that an apt response to the 4IR incorporates a coordinated, collaborative approach between role players; including government, public entities, private sector, academia and civil society.Other luminaries on the night included former Springbok rugby champion, Bryan Habana who remarked,“These awards recognise those who are pushing the envelope in their respective technological fields and set the foundation for Africa to prosper.” On that note, please see the winners of the 2019 AfricaCom Awards who are driving digital across Africa:Connecting the Continent – Liquid TelecomDelivering Excellence in Customer Experience – Ericsson and MTN GroupEverything as a Service: Best Cloud or Application Solution – VerimatrixChanging Lives Award – KaiOS TechnologiesBest Digital Entertainment Innovation Award - TelecomingSecurity Product or Service of the Year Award – Upstream SystemsBest Network Management Software Award: – Orange and HuaweiBest Connected Consumer Device Award – OrangeBest Innovation for Enterprise – SqwidNetMost Innovative Service — The Business of Tomorrow Award – Safaricom & HuaweiThe public voted categories of CXO and Enterprise CXO went to:CXO of the Year - Charles Molapisi, CTIO, MTN Group, andEnterprise CXO of the Year - Warren Hero, CDO, Webber Wentzel.Also introduced in 2019, was an award that recognises the contribution made by women to the development of Africa, adding weight to the call for gender parity in the industry, by showcasing the incredible achievements of each of these women.
