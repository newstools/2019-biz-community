Crucially, it dispels the myth that readers who prefer to consume their news in vernacular can’t access them online. The Isolezwe website was launched as a standalone in 2017, after the newspaper had showed potential while under parent website iol.co.za.In the first month of December of that year, there were just a little over 100,000 users (119,926). Slindile Khanyile, the editor of Isolezwe, is full of praise for the online team, which is led by live editor Mcebo Mpungose, for its sterling effort and for growing the online offering. “The biggest thank you goes to our readers who are loyal and who appreciate that all we do is inspired by them and is for them. I have always maintained that we don’t view online as competition, instead we see it as a platform to augment our print offering. “For the longest time, there was this untested and patronising belief that our readers did not want to consume news online and that they did not grasp how online worked. However, these website figures prove otherwise. Our readers may be largely low-income earners who prefer news in their mother tongue, but they are just as thirsty for knowledge and information, and they yearn to improve their lives. There is so much more we still need to do using technology to improve people’s lives,” she said. Last year, the online community grew significantly on Facebook and Twitter, and with that Isolezwe’s audience has adapted to how online content is delivered, the result of which is the remarkable half a million users two months before the second anniversary of going live as a standalone site. “In 2018, the Volt digital lab team did an outstanding job helping us understand our audience better by sharing with the online editorial team what our audiences are mostly searching for when they go on Google. This helped us establish what type of content Zulu-speaking people are looking for,” Khanyile added. “Also, social media analytics play a huge role. Because of the high engagement, we get feedback on what works – another tool we use to grow online traffic,” she said. In January 2017, the Facebook page had about 85,000 followers/likes. Today, that figure stands at more than 270,000 followers, with engagement and reach that reach millions in some months. Twitter has also risen significantly. This year, the publication added Instagram and WhatsApp, which work as an ICYMI (in case you missed it) type of platforms.  Launched in 2002, the Isolezwe print publication, which is a seven-day operation with weekend titles Isolezwe ngoMgqibelo and Isolezwe ngeSonto, is still just as strong. Second quarter ABC figures showed that Isolezwe daily sells 68,618 copies, while Isolezwe ngoMgqibelo is holding its own with an average sale of 55,416 and Isolezwe ngeSonto with 51,992.
