Even though Safari is over a hundred years old, Techsys wanted to ensure their new online home featured a fresh, contemporary design to act as a visual expression of the brand’s ongoing relevance. A playful, fun aesthetic was introduced to bring to the fore the energy and vitality of Safari’s products. The fruit and nut giant wanted to delight consumers, and also make their lives easier – which is why Techsys was tasked with ensuring the new site is as easy to navigate as possible.Above and beyond a look and feel that reflects vitality, the site content itself needed to express the many ways in which Safari is used in South Africans’ everyday lives. To this end, the new site focuses on providing value for Safari’s consumers by hosting a wide range of delicious recipes that incorporate Safari products as well as showcasing all their dried fruit and nut products. Content from the brand’s social media pages are integrated into the site, so that it is constantly updated and reflects SAFARI’s charming social presence. The site was built to make updating content easy and quick.With an eye on changing consumer needs, Techsys Digital was also tasked with future-proofing the website to allow for enhanced technical functionality around e-commerce and e-rewards.All in all, Techsys helped deliver a fresh new look for Safari on a user-friendly, future-enabled platform.
