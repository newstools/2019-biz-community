Says organiser Eben Keun, “This year we saw dozens of standout entries, some taking a stand against big social issues. Xenophobia has increasingly been in the spotlight of late, and The Prayer by The Odd Number portrays the painful true experiences of African immigrants in the country for Brand South Africa. Viewers were moved by the intense emotions depicted in the advert – prompting them to see the humanity in others and to exercise compassion, tolerance and acceptance. Sizwe’s Secret by Joe Public follows the life of Sizwe, a family and butcher in the Eastern cape who is fighting to provide for his family. As his story unfolds, we are reminded to be more discerning with our money and how we invest it." Big winners on the night The Awards saw a total of 21 gold statues handed out. Apart from the two overall awards, ten of these are single-entry golds, three are campaign craft gold, four are campaign gold and the remaining four, craft gold. The overall winners, TBWA/Hunt Lascaris took home two campaign craft golds and one campaign gold. The North-West University, who dominated the student category, won both a gold and a craft gold. Pendoring also awarded 23 silvers and 31 craft certificates on the night. The creative work on display at this year’s awards bodes well for our creative industry. The standards were high and proved beyond a doubt that South Africa can create locally relevant work that is still globally competitive. https://www.pendoring.co.za
