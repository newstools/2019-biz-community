While developed markets seem to have lost the battle to over-the-top players, African operators can harness the potential of the growing global trend of digital content on mobile devices early on. Upstream enables operators to monetize consumers’ thirst for mobile internet and the development potential of digital in Africa.”“At the same time, although mobile advertising revenues are set to rise to $186bn next year – fraud is predicted to hit $44bn within three years. Left unchecked, advertising fraud will stall the market, reduce operator value-added revenues and inevitably lead to higher tariffs for everyday services. Herein lies the opportunity for Africa’s mobile industry to grow. Our full suite of products is designed to help operators safeguard their revenues and customers,” Krief explained.Upstream is showcasing its product suite that responds to the challenges facing African markets. Connectivity gateway Zero-D and security platform Secure-D allow mobile operators to provide subscribers in emerging markets with uninterrupted and secure access to mobile internet. Upstream will also use the AfricaCom forum to unveil its new product, One-D, a unique all-in-one mobile marketing platform designed to drive digital acquisitions safely.One-D is a trusted mobile advertising ecosystem, offering end-to-end partner and digital channel management, working with 300 ad networks and local publishers. The platform is set to help operators increase revenues from digital advertising by up to 60 per cent while decreasing customer complaints due to fraud by up to 70 per cent.Krief added: “Malware directly impacts mobile users’ trust in both the MNOs and the technology itself. We block suspicious or fraudulent activity within apps and in ads to rebuild that trust and enable the growth of digital direct carrier billing.“We also use advertising revenue to fund free internet services for consumers who have run out of data and help operators create new revenue streams from digital. This is a win-win scenario as we believe that safe and uninterrupted mobile internet connectivity is a human right, a democracy staple, a prerequisite for growth and a major industry bet for Africa going forward, one that mobile operators are uniquely positioned to make happen.”Upstream’s success in Africa has also been recognised in the 2019 AfricaCom Awards with the company’s Zero-D and Secure-D solutions both shortlisted in Connecting the Continent and Security Product or Service of the Year categories.AfricaCom takes place at the Cape Town International Convention Centre (CTICC) in Cape Town, November 12-14, 2019.
