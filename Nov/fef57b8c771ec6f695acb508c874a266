The SABC has stated that it does engage the State Security Agency (SSA) on several matters – such as the leaking of board minutes - but it has taken a clear decision never to place journalists under surveillance. We [the South African National Editors Forum (Sanef)] welcome this decision.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/528277-625x325.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Getty" width="625" height="325">Image credit: GettyWhile the SABC Board has a right to protect the image and the interests of the public broadcaster, they equally have a responsibility to safeguard the SABC from political interference. It is for this reason that we are uncomfortable with the involvement of the SSA as it has been politicised in recent times and used as a weapon in factional political battles. The memory of the intimidation of SABC editors is still fresh on our minds as the state intelligence "swept" their offices recently in the name of protecting the SABC as "a national key point". While the SABC board's statement is reassuring by saying that journalists will not be under surveillance, Sanef finds it challenging to accept that the SSA will, at all times, act within those parameters. As Sanef, we are well aware of the chilling effect of security agents probing journalists working at a public broadcaster. There is too much scope for abuse. The threats to freedom of expression are apparent.We know that both Houses of Parliament have passed the Critical Infrastructure Bill. The bill replaces the National Key Points Act. The SABC is a national key point and will now be a critical infrastructure. The bill was sent to the President for signing at which point it will become an Act. Previously, Sanef made submissions on the bill arguing the unconstitutionality of provisions applied to journalists employed by an institution that is a national key point.We called for specific exceptions for editorial staff of the SABC from the provisions of the Critical Infrastructure Bill. Sadly, these were simply ignored by both Houses of Parliament.We will be writing to the President requesting him to consider Sanef's submissions on the unconstitutionality of the bill and to refer it back to the National Assembly to reconsider these constitutional concerns.We trust this will not be necessary and urge the President to send the bill back to Parliament to address the existing constitutionality problems with it.We officially give notice to the SABC Board, the President, Parliament and all South Africans that we act to protect the public broadcaster, including through launching legal proceedings to challenge the constitutionality of the bill if necessary. Finally, we want to state that Mary Papayya, who is Sanef Acting Media Freedom Committee chairperson, is committed to media freedom. Her actions speak for itself as our acting media freedom chairperson. We also place it on record that she recused herself from all discussions on all SABC concerned matters at our council meeting on Saturday, 23 November 2019  – and has previously done so in all SABC matters generally. Sanef has a conflict of interest policy to be henceforth included as a specific clause in our Sanef constitution. It states that our Council members and sub-committee chairpersons may never comment on any deliberations and decisions taken on the media house where they are employed.
