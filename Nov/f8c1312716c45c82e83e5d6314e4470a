Top Media and Communications founder, and then-CEO, Richard Fletcher  launched the awards in 2002 - yet they began life on the page, rather than the stage, with Top Media and Communications researching the performance of some 10,000 South African companies. Of those, roughly 2,500 qualified to list in the first edition of annual prestige-format Top Performing Companies publication; based on methodology developed in collaboration with the Deputy Director at UCT's Development Policy Research Unit. Top Media and Communications then launched the awards to showcase the very best of its published companies, along with SA's most accomplished individual business leaders. At the time, Fletcher drew upon the Graduate School of Business to help devise stringent awards qualification criteria, for both its top performing companies and other external entrants. All qualified finalists were then assessed by an independent panel of judges: industry experts, CEOs, academics and association partners. This pioneering recognition model has since been repeated and refined over the past fifteen years of the National Business Awards, and has also been applied to Top Media and Communications' other recognition platforms. Top Media and Communications would like to thank the National Business Awards judges, speakers, category sponsors, lifestyle sponsors, media partners and VIP and corporate and ministerial  guests. Most of all, thank you to the Awards' 100+ esteemed finalists for sharing their inspiring journeys of success with South Africa.
