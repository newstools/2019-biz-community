In addition to launching the Bursary Programme together with MSC Education Holdings, Dale has made over R200,000 worth of entry discounts available to young, black marketers for the 2019 and 2020 conferences. “The calibre of this conference is top drawer, including international and local speakers. This makes the conference a big-ticket item which students can rarely afford. Not only does the Nedbank IMC offer legitimate marketing students a discount, but Nedbank also streams the conference live through their Facebook page on the day, enabling access to the content for all,” says Dale. Khensani Nobanda, Group Executive Marketing and Corporate Affairs for Nedbank, says, “As a purpose-led brand, we’ve always supported initiatives that uplift the youth. What we love about the Nedbank IMC Bursary Programme is that it’s giving young people the opportunity to study, begin a career, and change their lives.” In 2020, two winners will be awarded bursaries to study a two-year National Diploma in Marketing and a one-year FET Certificate in Marketing through MSC Education Holdings. Cobus Potgieter, CEO and Founder of MSC, says that these bursaries provide the ability to study a fully accredited course for free for the two 2020 winners. “MSC’s blended learning style influences the way we deliver our courses; enabling the content to be delivered in an interactive, engaging and fun way which is what you need to inspire young marketers,” adds Cobus. Dale’s mission is to promote the business case for marketing and to uplift the youth. “Marketing is Business,” she says “and we need to prove that it works just like our theme for 2020 promises.” Eligible candidates can apply through the Nedbank IMC 2020 website.
