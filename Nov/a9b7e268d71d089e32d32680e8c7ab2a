We’ve delivered on integrated campaigns that have delivered on our clients’ bottom line, and in addition, helped position Riverbed around our great work, which is also good work. What I mean is that our greater good philosophy of creating social impact work is even more rewarding when it is effective.” Bridget Johnson, agency ECD, added, “We’ve moved away from traditional operational structures and approaches within the agency, and collectively buy-in to an ideas-led creative mandate. So, we’re intentionally bringing in new people who come from diverse industries and disciplines, which helps to cultivate a loose and fluid work environment that supports an ideas-first culture. The value for clients is evident in the novel concepts presented, the successful implementation and the results delivered.” Other recent wins include seven Prisms, including a Silver for Campaign of the Year and Riverbed was ranked in the Pendoring’s Top 10, too.
