Emerald green and burnt orange are the focal palettes of the interior, and combined with the bespoke lighting and hexagonal brass fittings they work together resulting in an informal social dining club – a beautifully redesigned space with a bold and unique identity. Inspired by the Epicurus quote: “We should look for someone to eat and drink with before looking for something to eat and drink”, the idea of Magnolia Social Dining Lounge was to revolutionise dining by creating a comfortable and inviting space for diners to interact with others. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527011-625x442.jpg" alt="Magnolia Social Dining Lounge opens at Erinvale Hotel and Spa" width="625" height="442">Chef Stefan Bekker believes that food should be an experience that is remembered - more than just a simple wholesome meal.
