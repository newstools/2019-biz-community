First, an administrative authority cannot submit its Interpretative Document as persuasive authority in judicial proceedings, unless such Interpretative Document qualifies as evidence of a consistent and impartial interpretation over a prolonged period by all those involved.Second and by necessary implication, an administrative authority (forming part of the executive authority) engulfed in litigation against a private citizen (inclusive of juristic entities) must, as the private citizen, convince a Court that its interpretation accords with, and is an accurate reflection of, the purpose of the legislation even if its interpretation qualifies as evidence, as set out above. It is, therefore, important for legal practitioners, their clients, and regulators to remember that it is only the judicial authority (generally understood as the Courts) that can and must interpret the meaning of legislation.
