In addition, Simelane will present a new Monday night politically driven current affairs show at 9:30pm and will be a frontline presenter during significant news events. Notes acting editor Jeremy Maggs: “Thulas is unquestionably one of the country's leading news personalities, and we're delighted that he is returning home. With his incisive mind and deep understanding of the complexities of the South African landscape, he adds huge value to an already stellar on-air lineup, that makes eNCA by far the most-watched news channel in the country." Simelane's return to the station is also part of a vigorous ongoing project to entrench eNCA's dominant market-leader position. In the coming weeks, more details will be announced about further talent acquisition. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527080.jpg?1" alt="Top anchor returns to eNCA" width="300" height="99">
