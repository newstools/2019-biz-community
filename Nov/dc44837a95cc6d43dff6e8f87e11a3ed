In its initial phases, the program will focus on handcrafts including textile and embroidery, food processing, citizen services, healthcare, agriculture, import and export and engineering; all key contributors to the Egyptian economy.Within the framework of the programme, Facebook professionals will provide “Training of Trainers” (TOT) courses to enable participants to effectively transfer their knowledge and expertise, ensuring that the programme’s impact continues to multiply.In Egypt, 71% of the people are already connected to at least one small or medium online business, and the number continues to grow every day. With 23 million Egyptians using Facebook daily via their mobile, digital marketing and e-commerce skills give businesses an indispensable edge in today’s fast-moving economy.“Egypt is one of the region’s fastest-growing e-commerce markets owing to its large and dynamic small and medium business (SMB) and startup ecosystem, which we are very excited to support. We know that when SMBs look to hire, people with digital skills are in highest demand. By preparing the workforce in Egypt with the resources they need to gain these skills, we hope to give businesses the resources they need to grow,” says Ramez Shehadi, Managing Director for MENA at Facebook.“Qualifying to become a Facebook partner is a milestone in RiseUp’s journey. Since its inception six years ago RiseUp has been supporting the advancement of entrepreneurs via partnerships with government and corporate organizations,” says Abdel Hameed Sharara, CEO of RiseUp. “We’ve successfully built a broad base of trust and reach among young Egyptians, allowing us to roll out ‘Boost with Facebook’, the first training program of its kind in the Middle East and Africa.”
