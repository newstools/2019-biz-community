BUDDHA IN AFRICA  | DOCUMENTARYIn a Chinese Buddhist orphanage in Africa, a Malawian teenager finds himself torn between his African roots and Chinese upbringing. Once the star performer with dreams of becoming a martial arts hero like Jet Li, Enock is now in his final year of school and has to make some tough decisions about his future. Will he return to his relatives in his home village or study abroad in Taiwan? Set against China’s expanding influence on the continent, Buddha in Africa provides a unique insight into the impact of cultural soft power on the identity and imagination of an African boy and his school friends growing up between two cultures.  Directed by South African Nicole Schafer, Buddha in Africa won Best South African Documentary at this year’s Durban International Film Festival, was the opening night film at Encounters, and screened at HotDocs. It’s currently screening to sold-out audiences at IDFA, arguably the world’s top documentary festival, as part of their prestigious Best Of Fests line-up. TRACKERS | SERIESBased on South African author Deon Meyer’s best-selling novel of diamond smuggling, rhino poaching, and an international terrorist plot to attack Cape Town, Trackers has already shattered viewership records to become the most popular show on M-Net in 2019, beating out even smash international hit shows like Game of Thrones.

THE HERD S1-2 | SERIES28 years ago, Bhekisizwe Mthethwa (Sello Maake Ka Ncube) was fired from his job at a butchery due to his leg injury. With no job and a hungry wife and baby, Bheki sought out the guidance of the local witch, MaMngadi (Winnie Ntshaba), who promised him a bright future if he was willing to make a great sacrifice. When we meet Bheki in the present, he’s married to MaMngadi, with three more children, Muzi (Sparky Xulu), Nkosana (Paballo Mavundla) and Dumazile (Cindy Mahlangu). But when Bheki must choose a successor to his cattle business, his big sacrifice still weighs heavily on his soul, even as his children go into battle over what each believes to be rightfully theirs.    This hit Mzansi Magic supernatural drama was nominated for Best Drama at this year’s SAFTAs and recently won the Jury’s Special Prize at the Seoul International Drama Awards. CARNAGE S1 | REALITYMad Max meets Top Gear in the Kalahari in this insane reality show that pits motorheads against one another in weaponised mutant cars. In this steampunk desert challenge, six teams transform ordinary vehicles into lethal weapons, then face off in three brutal arenas designed to push their cars to the limit.

Two first-time filmmakers, award-winning editor Susan Scott (The Last Lions) and 50/50 presenter Bonné de Bod, embed themselves on the frontlines of the rhino poaching crisis, where they are given exclusive access to the war as it unfolds on the ground. Carving out six months for the project, the two women quickly find themselves immersed in a world far larger and more dangerous than they had imagined, only emerging from their odyssey four years later. This hard-hitting South African documentary has ignited world-wide awareness of rhino poaching, screened at numerous film festivals and picked up 25 awards to date. Earlier this month, Stroop took the 2019 Video Media (Long Form) award at the prestigious SAB Environmental Media of the Year awards.
