I ran into Johnny at our studios on my way into the office, and managed to share a two floor elevator journey with him as he left the building (he had just finished an interview on Kfm and was rushing to the airport). He was in good spirits... we shared a joke and he even let me grab this selfie with him and his longtime manager and friend, Roddy Quin.
