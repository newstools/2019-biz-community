In fact, customer experience is expected to overtake price and product as the key product differentiator by the end of 2020.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1506/291087-120x120.jpg" alt="Customer experience, the key to remaining competitive in 2020" width="120" height="120">Customer experience, the key to remaining competitive in 2020Just over three in five organisations in South Africa (77%) say that customer experience will be the ultimate differentiator in their sector in five years' time...1 Jul 2015And when it comes to the management of customer experience, the pivotal role that data plays cannot be stressed enough. In fact, the entire CX ecosystem is dependent on having access to accurate and useful information.Concepts such as a single view of the customer (SVOC), hyper-personalisation and micro-segmentation are all key to an organisation’s ability to build and create the kind of personalised products, services and communication that customers expect.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1906/504153.jpg" alt="Creating competitive advantage through CX" width="120" height="120">Creating competitive advantage through CXGlobally, the shift towards automation is being driven by the need to increase agility and provide customers with a greater sense of immediacy...By Derek Bose 28 Jun 2019At the core of all of these is data.  But data shouldn’t just inform how businesses approach their client relationships, it should also underpin a modern organisation’s product, CX and communication strategies.What is a single view of the customer and why is it important?A single view of the customer means making all data about an individual available for other systems to customise that customer’s interaction with the company. SVOC is important, not to know what a customer has done in the past, but to predict what a customer will need in the future.   Having that kind of insight is vital to providing great CX. To use a practical, everyday example, would you feel more comfortable shopping at an online store that repeatedly serves you ads for the product you just bought or the one that uses your buying history to make recommendations for useful future purchases? Small wonder then that 86% of buyers are willing to pay more for a great customer experience and 49% of buyers have made impulse purchases after receiving a more personalised experience.In order to foster this kind of behaviour, organisations must pull together a range of different data types. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1907/508605-120x120.jpg?2" alt="5 ways to drive growth through customer retention" width="120" height="120">5 ways to drive growth through customer retentionBusinesses have become obsessed with their growth curve, regardless of the metric, number of users, customers and followers growth...By Kirsty Sharman 25 Jul 2019These include, but are not limited to: Information about the person: at the core is a system that identifies each individual client. This system should store identification data alongside contact information, geographic location, basic demographics, communication preferences and data processing consentsInformation about what the person does: supplementary information that is found in other internal data sources – such as ERP, sales, communication – need to be either integrated into a central warehouse or accessible to the system that is creating a single viewBig data: external sources of data are valuable in refining the shape of the customer.

It’s something that doesn’t even require you to collect new data before you use it as a CX improvement strategy.Instead, you simply have to understand the data you already have and how it can be used to personalise communication. Something as simple as a customer’s preferred communication channel can make a significant difference. Track engagement with each communication, and use this information to further personalise the next communication.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/459375-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Chatbots are the future of customer communications" width="120" height="120">Chatbots are the future of customer communicationsTwo technologies that are set to have a particularly big impact on customer communication going forward are chatbots and machine learning...By Brent Haumann 20 Sep 2018With every engagement, you’ll build a more complete view of each customer. At the same time, it’s important to run concurrent workstreams to develop access to other internal data sources.
