Customers want to engage with their brands of choice in a multi-dimensional, informative and interactive way. Marketing professionals realise that an engaged existing customer presents a better ROI than forever filling up the sales funnel with new customers. Digital advocacy programmes just may be the solution.How an advocacy programme can benefit your brandAdvocacy programmes are used by brands across sectors to stay in touch with customers, to deepen relationships and to increase loyalty. What’s more, advocacy programmes go beyond loyalty, to create long-term advocates that not only purchase your products and services, but recommend them to their customers, communities and friends. What does an advocacy programme consist of? No two advocacy programmes are the same, but all well-structured and successful advocacy programmes probably include content at its core. Critical to all advocacy programmes, though, is personalisation. Each user needs to feel like the programme is created especially for them as they receive personalised content delivered to them at the right time and to their preferred means of communication. Quality content deepens advocacy At the heart of most advocacy programmes is good, engaging and informative content that keeps users interested, informed, invested and most importantly recommending your products and services. Your advocacy programme may include a mix of the following:  Long articles  Short articles  Infographics  Newsletters  Videos  Case studies  Polls and surveys  Interactive experiences Interactive methodology deepens results Smart advocacy programmes make use of tried-and-tested methodologies to initiate, ignite and reward users for engaging with the programme, and importantly keep them coming back for more. Unlike websites that users may visit once or twice, advocacy programmes are designed with the primary objective of recurring communications and engagement. Smart advocacy programmes may make use of the following strategies:  Surveys  Questionnaires  Gamification  Rewards and incentives  Points  Tests  Comments Deep data smart actionable insights Beyond building meaningful and lasting relationships with customers, advocacy programmes provide marketing professionals with deep insightful data, that surpasses any other communication channel.
