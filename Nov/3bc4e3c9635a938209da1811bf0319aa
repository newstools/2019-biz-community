Thank goodness SABC 2 negotiated that they could screen this major event of national interest, it is clear that the TVRs delivered on SABC 2!(No gender filters included – women also watch rugby!)<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/520515-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: SA Rugby." width="120" height="120">#RugbyWorldCup2019: The numbers you never knewThe 2019 Rugby World Cup is in full swing. There are currently 20 nations playing in the 2019 edition - hosted by Japan...By Richard Lord 10 Oct 2019Facts and figures It is important to note that these figures do not take into account the screenings at rugby club villages (such as Monte), pubs, clubs and other group viewing venues. It is possible that we can add on, at the very least, an additional 50%.Just Googling some images of the game and it is easy to get a sense of the excitement of the home viewings.Taking a look at TVRs achieved across the two stations across four different demographics, it is really exciting just how ‘nation-building’ this final match was. TVRs achieved against LSM four to seven sit at 9.7 on a Saturday morning – bearing in mind that there are omnibus repeats of favourite soapies on SABC1 at this time too.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525306.png" alt="#RWC2019: The viewership figures of the SA v Eng final" width="481" height="289">And boy, were we glued to our screens! If you look at the ebb and flow of audiences every two minutes, people didn’t even make coffee/tea or even go to the toilet during the commercial breaks!<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1910/519168-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Springbok Supporters' Club" width="120" height="120">South African rugby fans marvel at the impact tech has on the gameA recent poll found that South African rugby fans marvel at the impact technology has on improving the experience of the game...2 Oct 2019The SABC2 LSM eight to 10 audience started at just over one million viewers and peaked at 1.6 million viewers by 1pm. Supersport 1 LSM eight to 10 audiences started at just over 700,000 and peaked at 915,000 as the game ended.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525307-625x287.jpg" alt="#RWC2019: The viewership figures of the SA v Eng final" width="625" height="287">Remember the point above regarding the SABC1 broadcast of Generations omnibus. Generations viewership peaked at 1,128,000 at 12.41pm – the victory was already ours.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525308-625x375.jpg" alt="#RWC2019: The viewership figures of the SA v Eng final" width="625" height="375">I also found it interesting to have a look at the advertisers that flighted their adverts during the game. There were 13 “paid-for” ads on SABC 2 and 16 “paid-for” ads on SuperSport 1 – all achieving impressive ratings.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525309.jpg" alt="#RWC2019: The viewership figures of the SA v Eng final" width="395" height="592">In a press release from DStv, the DStv Now App served more than 500,000 unique users during match day. In fact, the data carried by content delivery network partners during the final peaked at more than 500Gbps (more than 4,000GB of data per minute) – this is another record for DStv Now in Africa.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/524838-120x120.jpg?2" alt="DStv Now streaming records smashed by the Rugby World Cup final" width="120" height="120">DStv Now streaming records smashed by the Rugby World Cup finalSurprise, surprise.
