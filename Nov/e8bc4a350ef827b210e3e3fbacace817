The reason for the non-payment being the failure to disclose a diabetes risk. The public outcry at the story caused the insurance industry to rethink. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525597.jpg" alt="Sheree Bega" width="206" height="250">Sheree Bega"It is an honour to receive the KZN Vodacom Regional Award for Finance and Economics for my story on the Widow vs Momentum," said Waterworth. "I think this story gained such a massive public reaction as it resonated with anyone who has insurance. Along with the fact that Mr Ganas was killed in a botched hijacking with South Africans tired of the scourge of crime. Mrs Ganas not being paid out her husband's life insurance on a technical legality fractured the public's trust when it came to insurance paying out in times of trouble and despair. To Momentum's credit they created a new benefit solution for Mrs Ganas. "It was a David vs Goliath story," she said.

The former legal head had tried to manipulate a disciplinary hearing of a senior employee who was connected to the former mayor. But unbeknown to the legal head, the conversation was recorded. Ndaliso tells how he first had to track down the recording. "A person said, 'Chris there's this recording.' Then I had to find the recording - and then had to confirm the recording." After the story was broken in the Daily News, Ndaliso followed up on the disciplinary hearing of the former legal head. The legal head was suspended and fired once he had been found guilty. For Ndaliso, the award was some welcome recognition. "We are looked down upon as journalists, but we are the first people to be contacted when there's any wrong doing. It feels good when corruption is exposed. They can love us, or hate us, but we're here to stay," he said. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525599-625x416.jpg" alt="Independent Media journalists scoop KZN Vodacom awards" width="625" height="416">Read Ndaliso's original story here. Mofokeng's photograph appeared in the Daily News in July this year and told the story of a protest at the Durban University of Technology called by its EFF-supporting SRC. The picture shows a student running through teargas towards police. In addition two other Independent photographers were finalists in the category, their work highly commended - Doctor Ngcobo and Leon Lestrade.
