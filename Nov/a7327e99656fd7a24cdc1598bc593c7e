Mr Takudzwa Hove, spokesperson of SIM, points out that, amongst the many errors in the supporting affidavit, the PIC and its advisors cited the incorrect parties to the relevant legal agreements.  This action is not only incompetent and mala fide but malicious, on the part of the PIC and its advisors. SIM is of the firm belief this action is designed as a further attempt to embarrass and undermine the Sekunjalo Group and Dr Survé personally and is aimed at provoking a run on SIM’s major subsidiary, Independent Media, which is fully operational. This is part of a series of co-ordinated attacks on Independent Media, and ultimately, an attack on media freedom.Additionally, the PIC and its advisors have elected not to disclose in their court papers, SIM’s letter of 30 September 2019, addressed to its attorneys by SIM, wherein it is explained that SIM is not indebted to the PIC for any sum. SIM has to date, not received any response from the PIC in this regard. This application is a waste of taxpayers’ money and constitutes irregular spending on the part of the PIC, which should be investigated by the appropriate authorities. SIM has instructed its attorneys to oppose this frivolous application and seek the appropriate relief against those involved, which will include seeking a special costs order against the PIC and holding those responsible personally liable.
