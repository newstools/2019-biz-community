The TVC features uMalume, the respected uncle who is regarded as the one who imparts knowledge to the children of the family. In the new Debonairs Pizza ad, uMalume playfully uses this to his advantage, silently invoking his ‘Malume’ status to sneak a preview slice from each of the five pizzas delivered in the uniquely designed Khetha 5 box. The children respectfully wait and listen with only their eyes showing that they know exactly what his strategy is and appreciating the joke. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525057-625x115.jpg" alt="Umalume teaches his nieces and nephews about Debonairs Pizza" width="625" height="115">The ad flights on SABC, e.tv, DStv channels, M-Net and Comedy Central for three months.
