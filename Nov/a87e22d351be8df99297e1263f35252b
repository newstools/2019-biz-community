Developer Circles is a programme designed to create a network of developers across the world, organised locally by community members. The developers meet online and offline to create solutions that cater to the needs of their communities. Each circle is led by a volunteer circle lead, who arranges offline meetings and manages the Facebook Group where members can continue the conversation, share code and deepen their knowledge on topics like React and Bots in Messenger. Commenting on the summit, Chimdi Aneke, strategic program manager, developers and startups, Sub-Saharan Africa, said: “Facebook is a company that grew from the developer community, and Developer Circles is a programme aimed at making local developers stronger at a global scale. We are excited to bring together our community from around Africa for two days of talks, workshops and technical sessions as part of our ongoing commitment to growing the tech ecosystem across the continent.”
