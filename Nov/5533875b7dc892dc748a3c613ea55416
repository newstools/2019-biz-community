Will you be punished, suspended or banned from Google, Facebook and Instagram because how you strategise with the algorithm is deemed illegitimate?  Researchers at Rutgers University say more consistent standards are needed for advertisers, journalists, influencers and marketers seeking to boost their visibility on platforms such as Google, Facebook and Instagram.

The problem, according to the researchers, is that too often platform companies draw these lines unilaterally and arbitrarily, potentially harming well-intentioned content creators in the process. In the study, researchers analysed platform user guidelines and media coverage of three case studies in which Google, Facebook and Instagram accused a group of users of illegitimately “gaming the algorithm” and punished them by limiting their visibility, suspending, or banning them.  “Even though platform-drawn lines between ‘gaming the system’ and acting strategically are blurry, there is a public discourse where those who engage in behaviour deemed to be gaming are not just ‘mistaken’ about what the rules are, but that they are cheaters, offenders and acting criminally,” Petre said.  Algorithmic manipulationMore troubling is that the rules, guidelines, and punishments that have emerged seem to reflect digital intermediaries’ powerful structural position and commercial interests, rather than a coherent understanding of manipulation, deception, and authenticity.Social media platform companies are portrayed as neutral umpires acting in good faith, even though their decisions are driven by what is best for their business – a dynamic the researchers termed “platform paternalism.”   SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/457402-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The evolving beast within artificial intelligence" width="120" height="120">The evolving beast within artificial intelligenceAs technology tries to answer the ever-changing demands of human interaction and user needs, tech advancement carries on evolving at breakneck speeds where drastic changes can emerge suddenly and quickly...By Dave Nilsson 11 Sep 2018“The decisions about how algorithmic manipulation is formulated and enforced should be democratised to grant influence to a wider array of content makers – perhaps especially for those whose very livelihoods depend on algorithmic visibility,” Petre said.
