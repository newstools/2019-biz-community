In particular, the judges noted “the long-term effectiveness of Sanlam Reality’s use of data analytics and CRM to drive customer centricity within the Sanlam Group”, as well as the “world-class segmentation of its membership base”.“Loyal clients are the bloodline of profitable business and future business growth. Understanding the total lifetime value of clients by analysing data and insights enables Sanlam to be relevant and responsive with appropriate financial solutions that create and build wealth for all parties,” explains Francois Uys, Sanlam Reality’s Head of Marketing, Digital and Communications. “The Fourth Industrial Revolution is teaching us that future clients demand not only the right solutions, but the right experiences to access these solutions using disruptive technologies. We’ve been digitally transforming in partnership with Machine, to ensure we are personalising our campaigns and communications so as to deliver this seamless experience.” Fundamental to this ‘right experience’ has been Uys’ and Machine’s content marketing strategy, delivering ongoing financial wellness education over and above Sanlam Reality’s harder-sell campaigns and product messages. “We are committed to adding real value to our members’ lives,” explains Uys. “We’re here to offer consistent education and support that empowers our members to live their best financial lives. That means we invest in high-quality, always-on financial content as part of our CRM strategy. We ensure this content is relevant, compelling and constantly optimised through our data analytics.”It's a content marketing strategy that Machine has worked closely with Uys and his team to develop, implement and optimise. “We’ve been in partnership with Sanlam Reality for seven years, and over this time we’ve seen the strategic approach evolve into a highly sophisticated, targeted content-marketing communications strategy across a host of print and digital touchpoints,” says Sarah Browning-de Villiers, Machine’s Chief Content Officer. “Building and harnessing data capabilities allows the success of this approach to be exponentially amplified,” adds Uys. “This award is the result of Sanlam Reality doing exactly this.”The impact of this integrated approach for the Sanlam Group has been significant – double-digit uplifts in customer retention, uptake of additional Sanlam products or premium increases, and new-business leads.“As a brand experience agency, our specialisations and capabilities are focused on what our partners need to drive meaningful change and ROI in their businesses,” says Gareth McPherson, Machine’s Managing Director and Chief Creative Officer. “Our partnership with Sanlam Reality and this incredible result for Francois and his team is testament to this. To be winning in the area of data analytics and how this is applied to your customers’ experience of your brand is the kind of result that distinguishes Sanlam Reality from its competitors – something we are very proud to have played a role in.”About Machine Born out of digital, Brand Experience company Machine, is home to 70 adventurous minds.
