The new platform, Toyota Connect, is housed within the MyToyota App which was launched in 2014. The technology provides Toyota owners with access to a myriad of internet-connected services, including music and video streaming, battery health check, vehicle service bookings, fleet management alerts and driver rating capabilities. It satisfies two key drivers of Toyota’s business today: its desire to continually improve and offer the consumer a better and more seamless experience with the Toyota brand, and the fact that connectivity is fast becoming a consideration for selecting your model of choice when making a vehicle purchase. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/526458-625x307.jpg" alt="MyToyota launches intelligence platform to keep Toyota drivers connected" width="625" height="307">As of September 2019, all new Toyota and Lexus models sold in South Africa come standard with in-car Wi-Fi, including 15GB free data. “As Toyota transitions from being an automotive to a mobility solutions organisation, it becomes imperative to collaborate with companies whose visions align with ours,” said General Manager Customer Services, Derek Kemp. “The importance of telematics and telecommunications in tomorrow’s vehicles cannot be overstated. Consumers are increasingly becoming aware of how connected technologies can enhance their lives and our task as a forward-thinking organisation is to evolve in tandem with market expectations.” The brief to FCB Joburg was to deliver a piece of content that best encapsulated the true spirit of the Toyota brand and communicated what the Toyota Connect experience offers. The team needed to find a simple yet catchy way of communicating a product that is actually quite complex with many features and aspects to it. The solution was to put the messages to music but using real-life scenarios to visually unpack them in just a few seconds. It acquired the mechanical rights to My Sharona by the Knack, and wrote lyrics that talk to Toyota Connect’s features. The band singing the track ‘swoops in’ on three different scenes showing how the new platform enhances the Toyota driver’s life.
