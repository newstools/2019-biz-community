The South Sudan Media Authority said they revoked her accreditation on 23 October because of an article she wrote about tensions in the capital Juba ahead of the formation of the unity government.In July, Michael Rial Christopher, editor of the Al-Watan newspaper, was arbitrarily arrested and detained for over a month, widely believed to be over an article he published about the protests in Sudan.
