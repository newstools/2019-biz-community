It gives Lafarge a greater purpose because, yes, they are constructing buildings, dams, monuments and houses, but all of these structures began as a dream in the mind of a Zambian. Once built, these dreams create a stronger, better Zambia, for future generations.”A TVC with emotionUsing the same emotive trigger of building a better future, the TVC sees a grandfather reminiscing with his grandson, reinforcing the message that Lafarge cement is reliable, high-quality, and built on a foundation of 70 years within Zambia. Boomtown partnered with local teams in Zambia, resulting in collaboration with a local activation company, a TV production company and local actors to produce a high-quality final product that is genuinely Zambian.
