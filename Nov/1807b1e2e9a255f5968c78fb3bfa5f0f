Governments must duly fulfil their role. Evidence shows that countries with no pragmatic policies to engage the youth have experienced slow or no economic growth.Global participants to the AEC will discuss the role of African governments to address lack of appropriate training, and youth unemployment that is hindering inclusive and sustained economic growth. Researchers will share perspectives on what makes youth policies effective, and what institutional and regulatory environment governments must pursue to build effective youth capacity. Experiences will be shared on African countries that have put youth at the heart of their strategies and policies.
