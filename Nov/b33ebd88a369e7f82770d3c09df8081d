The vehicle they were travelling in has also been impounded for further investigation.The arrests followed the discovery of two fresh rhino carcasses in the section and were covered with grass and twigs to delay their discovery. The suspects are in custody and SANParks is not ruling out further arrests. They will appear in court to face rhino poaching related charges in due course.CEO of SANParks Fundisile Mketeni has congratulated the team on the arrests and continued to warn criminals that KNP is ready to stop them in their tracks, “We are thankful that one ranger managed to subdue five criminals without any harm unto himself and continue to warn those who intend poaching in the KNP that our dedicated staff, technology and information from communities will lead to your incarceration. We won’t stop until all criminals are removed from society,” said Mketeni.
