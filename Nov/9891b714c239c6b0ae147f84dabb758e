While opportunity in Africa's tech space is ample, to grow and enable the continent's digital economy requires extensive collaboration and greater efforts in closing the gender representation and pay gap, she said."Definitive data shows that companies that are gender diverse actually outperform more homogeneous companies that don't invest in women."It is a fact that companies that create enabling environments actually outperform [their counterparts] and their shares do better than companies that don't."<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/526600-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#AfricaCom: Smartphone costs the biggest barrier to a digitally inclusive Africa" width="120" height="120">#AfricaCom: Smartphone costs the biggest barrier to a digitally inclusive AfricaThe next technological evolution is advancing at an exponential rate and by leaving out some on this journey, we allow the current societal divides and inequalities to deepen...By Sindy Peters 15 Nov 2019Producing tangible resultsSebata outlined three ways to stop conversations and gatherings around gender diversity being just talk shops, rather producing tangible results.There, firstly, needs to be a mind-shift toward greater collaboration and "realising that if you're going at it alone, you're not going far", she said. Agreeing to move as one will promote the development of an enabling environment.Secondly, there needs to be greater focus on skills and workforce development in order to grow the pool of successful African female professionals who will employ the philosophy of "lift as you rise" in advocating for greater equality.Lastly, Sebata emphasised that cultural thinking should be embraced and employed to inform empirical thinking in enabling transformation.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/526705-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#AfricaCom: Tech skills needed to create future jobs on the 'side-hustle' continent" width="120" height="120">#AfricaCom: Tech skills needed to create future jobs on the 'side-hustle' continentUp to 18 million jobs need to be created annually just to absorb the new entrants each year.

She encouraged more women to raise their hands when opportunities are presented, and to support each other as the traditional "boy's club" has done over the years, building a sense of unity."I am hoping that we leave this place not only having heard inspiring words from one another. I'm hoping that we leave this place having found ways to become a collective of women that is going to change the narrative," Bouwer said.
