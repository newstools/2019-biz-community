<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527704.jpg" alt="A story of celebration: Workbench relaunches the Mukuru brand with new TVC" width="600" height="314">Mukuru is a money transfer company that exists to serve the diaspora in Africa. The company provides a service to foreign nationals who add considerably to the texture and economy of South Africa. While communicating the brand message, the commercial shows the hard work and sacrifice that has become a way of life for many of the foreign migrants living and working in South Africa. It celebrates their commitment, it focuses on the hope in their provision, and highlights the gratitude of the people who depend on that connection. When Workbench was tasked to develop the strategy for the brand going forward (expanding it so that it communicates to a broader audience), they willingly took on the challenge. “Mukuru is a visionary, brave and entrepreneurial brand that is not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve and show that it cares for its customers, the diaspora of Africa,” explains Michael Cook, MD of Workbench.The TVC and the over-arching campaign shows the human side of what lies beneath the hard work and sacrifice that foreign nationals have embraced, to ensure that their families are looked after back home. The brand is Proudly African and embodies the continent’s spirit, resilience and positivity. The campaign is testament to that, reflected even further by the fact that the lead actor is a real Mukuru client.Workbench’s Creative Director, Sean van der Westhuizen, explains that Mukuru is a trusted brand that was established 15 years ago and the TVC leverages that brand trust. “Mukuru is more than a money transfer service, it genuinely cares about its customers.  The redefined brand message needed to show this and in turn claim the high ground of being the brand that reflects the gratitude for what the senders do every day. It’s a story of celebration not misfortune,” says van der Westhuizen.For Mukuru Head of Marketing Bronwyn Pretorius, the new campaign is also about saying thank you. “We’re a money transfer service provider that is constantly in tune with its customers’ needs, in order to find ways to give them what they need. The new TVC establishes this link in a powerful way. And we’re not going to stop saying thank you to our customers and will continue to serve their needs in a way that understands them best,” says Pretorius.
