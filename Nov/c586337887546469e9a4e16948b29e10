Opening the Love Walk in Johannesburg, Bishop Marcelo Pires said: It is important to stress that it is impossible to change your wife or your husband. The effective way to resolve challenges in a relationship is to understand your partner, realise why they are behaving the way they are, and to get to know how they make decisions and what upsets them. When you know your partner on a deep level, you know what they need and what to avoid in order to prevent conflict. Have a conversation about your relationship and you will see positive benefits.Couples were given a set of questions covering different aspects of life and asked to discuss them together. By listening to the answers and being able to talk openly about difficult areas, many couples gained new insights and deepened their relationship. Single people had a different set of questions to help them understand themselves and identify what they are looking for in a life partner.Bishop Marcelo said: Your relationship may already have been compromised. The busy environment and daily pressures of work and life prevent couples from spending time together and often have little time with their children. Without effective communication people do not understand each other and questions arise: Why does she respond as she does? What does this body language mean? Why is she upset? Today is an opportunity for you to reconnect, to tell your partner what you are feeling, celebrate what is working well and discuss areas which need attention. Use this time to stop and think, to talk without judgement and find a way forward.Giving men a tip he said: “Your wife wants your attention. Give it to her and your marriage will be great.”He said: “While it is important to understand who your spouse is, you will need to make sacrifices. Like the branch of a tree, if you are too stiff, you will break, but if you are too flexible you will accept behaviour which will damage your family.”Mrs Marcia Pires said: During this time together, you will have your partner’s attention. Use it wisely. Speak honestly and learn to listen to each other. These two aspects of communication are essential to build a successful and lasting relationship.Couples shared testimonies of what they had learned at previous events and through the teaching at the Universal Church’s weekly Therapy of Love meetings.One young man said that while he was dating he was proud and refused to listen to his girlfriend when she tried to correct him. They ended their relationship, but in time he realised that he wanted to be with her and invited her to the Love Walk last year. During this time they began to communicate honestly and he learned to accept correction. His girlfriend learned to listen to him and think about what he had said rather than respond in anger. Their relationship developed and they were married in June this year.A second couple stressed the importance of respecting one another as individuals with different needs and said they had learned how to adapt to each other and meet the needs of their partner.Many couples agreed that setting aside this time to communicate without distractions was essential to working through challenges and preventing baggage building up. They said the Love Walk provided a chance to renew their relationship and they would continue to talk about the suggested subjects in future.For further information, please contact Nametso Mofokeng at the church’s public relations department on 011 224 3400 or email pr@uckg.org.zabRev('brev-f0bfdfd4-a79f-40af-84d1-0a16bad53d6f', '>a/\<az.gro.gkcu@rp>"az.gro.gkcu;46#&rp:otliam"=ferh "knalb_"=tegrat a<').
