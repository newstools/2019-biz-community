Known by most as former host of (tech)5 on 5FM, his fast speech is peppered with his own observations as well as interesting factoids you probably wouldn’t have heard anywhere else. And when he goes off on a tangent, he always finds a way to weave it back into the original topic.So, whether you’re spending five minutes or five hours with him, you’re sure to walk away thinking about the world and how it works in a different way, as Dingle is not only interesting to talk to, but always interested in how we can do things better, especially when it involves fintech. For example, his current project Lettuce is aimed at improving the world of money, and he was part of the teams that started 22seven and Luno, which streamlined fintech acceptance in SA. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1901/477443-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Dominique Collett, head of AlphaCode" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: It's all about fintechInnovations in the fintech space is showing no signs of slowing down.

What would you say has been the biggest tech catalyst since then?For me, personally, it’s been cryptocurrency, because I’ve been working with it for the better part of the last decade. More fundamentally, it’s been seeing the internet continue to spread and transform industry. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/524569.jpg" alt="Cryptocurrency advertising is an emerging industry" width="120" height="120">Cryptocurrency advertising is an emerging industryAdvertising and promotion in the digital era is becoming a prominent fixture. It might be hard to master, especially in the cryptocurrency sector, as this is still very much a niche that is just now evolving into a mainstream industry...By Craig Lebrau, Issued by Lebrau Press 4 Nov 2019What we’re currently doing with blockchain and associated technologies wouldn’t be possible without the internet. We’re still seeing battle lines around anachronistic ideas of intranets, for example, being reintroduced now as terrible ideas, like private blockchains. The same companies that were selling snake oil to enterprises in the software space, with service-orientated architecture and other crap 15 years ago, are now trying to sell their crap under the guise of blockchain, and it’s still crap. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1809/459816-120x120.jpg?2" alt="image © ." width="120" height="120">The rise of the internet classLately, I have been followed. The man who is following me has good hair and dead eyes. It would seem wherever I go on the internet, he pops up. He is young, very young, but is constantly telling me that he has the wisdom and the secret stuff that can help me...By Damon Stapleton 26 Sep 2018Luckily they’re not doing so as convincingly anymore. Many chief information officers (CIOs) didn’t know what the hell they were buying 15 years ago, and could afford to spend R100m on technology they were never going to use in the organisation. Now, that ship has sailed. It’s a very different world today. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517595-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Lisa MacLeod, head of digital, Tiso Blackstar Group." width="120" height="120">#DigitalJourneys: The power of contentTwenty years ago, there was no Wi-Fi, Google, social media, podcasts, Kindle and Netflix. A decade ago, there were no iPhones, smartphones, tablets, Chrome, GPS, Airbnb, Uber, Bitcoin or Blockchain. While all of these demonstrate the fast pace of change, all of them have been massively disruptive to how we produce and consume content...By Danette Breitenbach 20 Sep 2019That said, it’s the open internet that still wins in every single example. Your company doesn’t need, nor should it want, an intranet. Your company does not need, nor should it want, a private blockchain. The same goes for the country.A good gauge for me is whether the latest iteration is something that connects people, whether it’s giving us a global way to transact, or if it’s just creating new domains and more siloes and loci of control. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/528381-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Dingle presenting at Catalyst Africa." width="120" height="120">#CatalystAfrica: Simon Dingle debunks fintech and cryptocurrency mythsSimon Dingle started his Catalyst Africa presentation by confirming that when he's not making apps or writing books, he loves thinking out loud in public about a variety of divergent topics...By Leigh Andrews 12 Nov 2019If it’s the latter, I don’t think it deserves our support. If it’s the former, you’re literally on the money. The internet gives us the platform to do that in any industry imaginable, and cryptocurrency is how we do that with money. That’s been the biggest catalyst, both in my personal life and career-wise over the past decade. .bizicon + br{display:none} h2 .bizicon img{top:10px !important}Interesting. Two of the points that resonated with me from your Catalyst Africa talk were on the news and storytelling link, as well as the ‘borderless-ness’ of the world. Please comment on the role of the media as a catalyst for growth, and how we often get it wrong. This is something very close to my heart, as I come from a media background, and I worked as a journalist for a very long time. My startup called Lionheart is looking at tackling some of these problems.Lionheart is a platform that makes it easy for individuals to support the journalists and investigators fighting fake news, corrupt politicians, dictatorial regimes, censorship and bad business.We have some interesting ideas but it’s early days, so I’ll reveal more later down the line.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1810/463911-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image ©" width="120" height="120">Put truth first in news reporting and information-sharing in generalMedia outlets are clearing their throats, pulling up their socks and clarifying their editorial policies following the 'Sunday Times fake news fallout'.

This is true in some examples, but I also think that societally, we have let the media down. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/514842.jpg" alt="The age of the artificial; the proliferation of 'fake'" width="120" height="120">The age of the artificial; the proliferation of 'fake'A threat to democracy, discourse, to truth; 'fake news' has become the buzzword of the last few years...By Molly Fitz-Patrick, Issued by Red & Yellow 3 Sep 2019Journalists are underpaid and expected, in some cases, to risk their lives to expose the truth, especially with Trump in the USA telling us “journalists are the enemy of the people”. It’s a pernicious and dangerous lie that we need to stomp on as soon as possible. I’m incredibly disheartened by this era of fake news and the idea that the media is the enemy and never gets it right.Certainly, the part about ‘never getting it right’ is likely true to an extent, but that to me is more a story of under-resourcing and the fundamental changes that have taken place, to what it means to be a journalist in the 21st century.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517690-120x120.jpg?2" alt="The panel was moderated by Francis Herd.

For example, take the rise of podcasting, where the top five podcasts in the world feature episodes that are at least an hour long, sometimes 2.5 hours long. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/492801-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#Bookmarks2019: Bravery in telling stories without fear or favour" width="120" height="120">#Bookmarks2019: Bravery in telling stories without fear or favourEyewitness News recently won a Bookmarks' Gold for its Poisonous Bullets: The Silent Betrayal of Sindiso Magaqa three-part podcast series...By Jessica Tennant 16 Apr 2019We’ve replaced the cheap and pointless five-minute discussions with long narrative, long-form conversations around a single topic, where we actually gain a better-than-average understanding of that topic.There is nothing so simple that you can reduce it to a two-minute soundbite on radio or TV, and that’s what we’re used to seeing from the news now, as everything is more complicated and in-depth than that timeframe allows for.So, I’m also optimistic about how media is being reimagined in the 21st century. What I think is missing is some of the rigour and discipline of traditional journalism in terms of verifying facts, querying sources and, most importantly, fighting against the taint of advertising in the media.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1505/278756-120x120.jpg" alt="Progressing the podcast bubble with the basics on Binary.fm" width="120" height="120">Progressing the podcast bubble with the basics on Binary.fmTech genius Simon Dingle started podcasting in 2004 when the global community was small and there was barely even a word for what they were doing.

That’s the reason I won’t use Facebook or Instagram, which I see as one of the most perniciously evil things ever invented. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1904/493440-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Could crypto incentives help fight Facebook's fake news epidemic?" width="120" height="120">Could crypto incentives help fight Facebook's fake news epidemic?There's a paradox at the heart of modern journalism and news production: consumers like the convenience of social media as a delivery device for news, but the prevalence of fake news has made it harder for readers to trust and verify their sources...By Bruce Silcoff 23 Apr 2019We need to start, as a society, moving away from platforms that are advertising-supported and towards platforms that are audience-supported. That’s why I’m so excited about podcasting.

That’s always been the case.It’s more fake news spread by the advertising industry that you simply can’t run a business without advertising.You can, as good products speak for themselves and don’t need advertising. I will fight that point to the death! Part of a product being good is not just in what it enables and the technology it incorporates, but also in the story that it tells. Again, you’ll get the advertising industry telling you that they are fundamental to how you tell that story – bulls#it. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1811/468903-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Jennifer Thomas is an assistant professor in the department of media, journalism, and film at Howard University. © ." width="120" height="120">The best of times and the worst of times for journalismJennifer Thomas, an award-winning, veteran American broadcast journalist, was invited by the United States Embassy (South Africa) to address the Cape Town Press Club on media coverage of elections in the age of fake news late last month...By Juanita Pienaar 14 Nov 2018Good products tell their own stories, run their own communities, have their own audiences and don’t need crappy technology to show ads on social media feeds.Dingle certainly tells it like it is.
