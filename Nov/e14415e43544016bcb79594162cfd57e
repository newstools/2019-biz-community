The most successful pieces of digital marketing were those that consumers felt had a person behind them. This is why aspects such as social media personalisation, more intuitive SEO practices as well as geo-location marketing became staples in the digital marketer’s 2019 toolkit.Social media becomes more conversationalMany marketers latched onto the idea of social media marketing as a relatively inexpensive way of getting their brand messaging in front of their target markets. Owing to the number of social media platforms that are propagating on a frequent basis, marketers felt that they had to be on all social networks – no matter how many there were.“The result of this,” says Schneider, “was that ‘canned content’ was being developed. What I mean by ‘canned’ is that a set of generic content was developed – be it social media posts, videos or blogs – that was shared across multiple platforms and no thought was given to tweaking this content to make it in line with the particular social media network’s audience.”As it became very easy for users to spot marketing content, because the posts were the same across a number of platforms, these users switched off from this type of content which meant that the thousands of rands which were spent on generating this material went to waste.Thus, in order to make sure that this situation no longer happened, in 2019 brands actively engaged in social media and started to listen to what their customers were saying. Based on this feedback, they tweaked their product offerings so that they were in line with their clients’ needs and wants.SEO became more intuitiveTowards the end of 2019, Google released its Bert update, which stands for “Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers”. While, at first glance, it may seem as only those who are tech-savvy will have any hope of understanding what this means, in a nutshell what this means is that Google has adjusted its algorithms to better understand natural speech patterns.This means that when posing questions, Google now returns more relevant answers. So, in order for your site to have any hope of being picked up by search engines and being included in the recommendations that it serves users now, more than ever, your site needs to contain hyper relevant content. The more specific the content is the better chances you have for being found.Geo-location marketing becomes the normThis is more relevant for people who own local businesses. As geo-location marketing promotes to people who are in the area, either through Google or social media, and are actively looking for a service or product that is similar to that which the business offers, the lead is already qualified and further down the sales cycle as opposed to someone who is merely browsing. This makes it much easier for them to convert into a sale. “Thus,” concludes Schneider, “geo-location marketing is a very valuable source of potential customers for location-based businesses and should be invested in heavily for this type of business.”2019 was a year filled with a lot of learnings for digital marketers. 2020 will be an interesting year in which these learnings can be built upon and expanded so that all businesses out there can enjoy digital marketing success.The Digital School of Marketing is an online provider of accredited digital marketing education which is accredited by the MICT Seta.
