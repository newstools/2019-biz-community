The awards consistently strive to offer a host of practical examples of how marketers, agencies and publishers have executed digital campaigns to deliver sustainable impact on their business. We are especially excited about the newly introduced categories, as well as the decision to elect an 8th panel representing specialists in Social, Community and Digital Influencer Marketing."The inaugural Social, Community and Digital Influencer Marketing Panel is led by Kalliebree Keynerd, Head of Social at Joe Public Connect; The Marketing Panel is led for the second year by Molefi Thulo, Executive Creative Director Ogilvy South Africa; Publishers by Chris Louw, Head of Content for Hive Digital and IAB SA Publisher Committee Chair; Performance Marketing by Clare Trafankowska, Head of Digital Carat for her second year; Builders by Robyn Campbell, Managing Director at Hello FCB+ Cape Town and IAB SA Agency Council Chair; Innovation Engineers by Dee Chetty, Lead - Accenture Interactive Africa, Special Honours by Charlene Beukes, GM at 24.com and IAB SA Executive Board Member for her second year; and Gaming by Gabriel Ramokotjo, CEO Ekasi Sports.Build brands digitallyThere is no doubt that digital interventions have the power to transform business, but our industry currently faces the challenge of creating a clear set of criteria for the measurement of success.  As we look to the future, it is the responsibility of the IAB, its members and the industry to create the benchmarks for business excellence in the digital economy. The Bookmark Awards presents the opportunity to develop measurement data to develop benchmarks for business excellence, and our current awards platform and data is a strong foundation for this to take place. This is why the Bookmarks have the potential to affect industry change with the IAB SA and CONNECT Benchmarking report that has commenced under the leadership of Melissa van Zyl, Partner at M&C Saatchi Connect and previous IAB SA board member, due for delivery in Q1 2020.Paula Hulley, CEO of the IAB SA says, “A huge thank you goes out to the industry for their incredible response to the 2020 Bookmarks nomination process, including a wide spectrum of small to big companies, specialists and digital generalists, independents and groups with diversity across company, age, gender, race, capability and expertise. It is this strong, highly-skilled, diverse panel of judges that represent the evolution of the digital industry. We feel privileged to hear their unique insights on this year’s work, as the 2020 Bookmarks sets the benchmark for digital excellence in our country.”  Full list of judges.kInstance-Body .kInstance-SubHeading{font-size:18px;padding:0px;margin:0px} .kBodyTableT table td {padding:5px;} .kBodyTableT strong{border:1px;
