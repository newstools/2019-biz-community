You may have noticed a few terms and phrases flood your Twitter feed throughout this year. From O jewa ke eng? to Sco tu pa manaa, the rise of these phrases has taken ‘viral vocabulary’ to a new level on social media. But now, there’s a new word roaming the Twitter streets: ‘bomboclaat’. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/525009-625x442.jpg" alt="Meltwater's analysis of the 'bomboclaat' trend on Twitter in October" width="625" height="442"> According to the Urban Dictionary, ‘bomboclaat’ is defined as a “common Jamaican expletive” used to express either extreme of excitement or sadness. As one Twitter user pointed out though, it has nothing to do with being a greeting or asking for one’s experience, like Sco tu pa manaa does. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/511882-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Image credit: Omar Lopez on Unsplash." width="120" height="120">Who 'run the world' in SA's #WomensMonth social media coverage?Meltwater has been monitoring the #WomensMonth conversations on social media in South Africa to see if girls truly 'run the world' in a month dedicated to them...16 Aug 2019Where did ‘bomboclaat’ come from?‘Bomboclaat’ was first used as a meme by Twitter user @rudebwoy_lamz on 3 September 2019 when his tweet appeared with side-by-side images of a character from the CatDog TV series captioned ‘Bomboclaat’. Bomboclaat pic.twitter.com/UevYs4jOQx— L A M A R��⚡ (@rudebwoy_lamz) September 3, 2019From there, the tweet slowly picked up in retweets and likes as a thread also began to form beneath the original tweet as users began sharing their versions of what they thought this meant.

Around this time ‘bomboclaat’ was used by several Twitter users in Jamaica as an expression similar to a curse word.You know what I call this?
