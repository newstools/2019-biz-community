Similarly, the opportunities are available in abundance. Our diverse panel of experts will share their insights from a local and cross border focus. Their observations and experiences on various aspects of communications, media landscape and overall business in African markets will be put on the spotlight. Africa is seen as one of the fastest growing economic regions in the world. The opportunities for the communications industry and brands are endless.
