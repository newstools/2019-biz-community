Drawing from the unique local influences that evoke a sense of homegrown offset with global parity and a sense of a shrinking world. The result is a one-of-a-kind Tartan meets Panstula pattern unique to the brand. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/526678-625x474.jpg" alt="SA creative meets Scotch inspiration and Soweto Heart is born" width="625" height="474">The story behind Soweto Heart is captivating and gives a great sense of SA pride. Scottish Leader has formed an ongoing partnership with I See A Different You (ISADY), a small team of widely followed Artists and Influencers. ISADY stands for a different view and re-visioning the world in a positive light. The three guys grew up in Soweto, which is typically perceived as rough and poor, but the ISADY guys have spent the last few years trying to capture Soweto in a different light, through their eyes - as colourful, and rich in culture and creativity. Correspondingly, Scottish Leader stands for A New Perspective, which is why the authenticity of the collaboration has proven so successful for the brand.Recently Scottish Leader took the ISADY team to Scotland. They returned with a unique creative interpretation of their experience that packaging specialists Just Design could draw from in designing a new limited pack. Designers used the ISADY team’s standout sense of fashion as a departure point. One of the outfits they wore on their trip was a twist on South African Pantsula style. The pack design combines Pantsula patterning with traditional Tartan, also incorporating the beautiful greens for which Scotland is famous. This brought to life a Limited Edition Label and Gift Box that captures Scottish Leader/Scotland through ISADY's eyes.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/526675-625x474.jpg" alt="SA creative meets Scotch inspiration and Soweto Heart is born" width="625" height="474">The dynamic, creative pack appeals to new markets. And the brand can also speak directly to a wider audience through the ISADY team, who have a massive following and a huge influence on the mainstream market.<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/526671-625x474.jpg" alt="SA creative meets Scotch inspiration and Soweto Heart is born" width="625" height="474">Look out for this colourful limited edition, which launches in [date] 2019.
