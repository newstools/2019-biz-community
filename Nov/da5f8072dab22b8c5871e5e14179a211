Where do you live, work and play? I live in the beautiful city of Cape Town, where my work and play needs are well met. 2. What’s your claim to fame? I invented the toaster strudel. Well, not really but I would have liked to. My claim to fame is really pushing the boundaries of what’s possible, which could be anything from building white-label solutions to starting client-facing innovations labs. 3. Describe your career so far. It has been quite the journey. My career started, like they do in the movies, from the metaphorical mail room. I started at Lilo as an intern, which turned into a full-paying job as a designer/front-end developer. From there, I moved on to Gloo where the fun really started and worked on some really great projects which bolstered my love for the industry. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1812/475398-120x120.jpg?2" alt="#BizTrends2019: The transformative power of transparency" width="120" height="120">#BizTrends2019: The transformative power of transparencyTransparency.

Because, for audiences, customers and employees that have seen everything, it is time to reveal it all...By Paula Hulley 25 Jan 2019With the help of a few great mentors – Graham Talbot and Paula Hulley to name a few – I just kept climbing the ladder one step at a time, absorbing as much as I could from those around me. Now cut to 2019, where I’m working for HelloFCB+ as a creative technologist among some of the most amazing creatives and developers in Cape Town. I couldn’t have asked for anything better! 4. Tell us a few of your favourite things. Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens. These are a few of my favourite things… alongside being a foodie, enjoying the hustle and bustle of Cape Town and anything Japan (the good stuff, not the weird stuff).

What do you love about your industry? Honestly, it's the creativity. There is nothing more enjoyable than watching the cultivation of an idea. 6. Describe your average workday, if such a thing exists. The good thing about being in my position is that every day is different. Yes, the meetings and admin are consistent but beyond that, it's anyone's guess how my day will go.

What are the tools of your trade? Google, Google and more Google. Learning is a key part of the job and constantly keeping in touch with the latest technologies, strategies and creative buzz is key.Beyond the textbook research approach, there is also communicating with industry professionals to unearth more experienced insights regarding technology, prototyping the core concepts of the end product and then presenting it on where it makes sense to everyone.  8. Who is getting it right in your industry? I always look to our rivals in King James and Ogilvy, they add such value to our industry as a whole.

List a few pain points the industry can improve on. Internship programmes need some improving. I’d love to see us taking on a more structured approach, which focuses on the growth of the individual in a goal-orientated system, or dare I say gamifying their growth. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1909/517037.jpg" alt="HelloFCB+ creates endowment fund to honour Simon Nicholson, support skills development initiatives" width="120" height="120">HelloFCB+ creates endowment fund to honour Simon Nicholson, support skills development initiativesHelloFCB+ has created an endowment fund to celebrate the life of one of its employees, Simon Nicholson, who passed away in 2018...Issued by FCB Joburg 17 Sep 2019It would not only shape our industry for the better, but also produce better talent. 10.
