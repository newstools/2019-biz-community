'AD Sync Boost' launched!" width="625" height="109">If you work with Rocketseed (customer or partner) and already use our email signature software and new interface (thanks for the positive feedback – YAY!), you know that we aim to please and everything is about the product combined with customer service and user experience.In that sense, we wanted to make your life easier and given the successful beta testing by friendly enterprise customers, our Azure Active Directory Sync is doing just that.Our ‘AD Sync Boost’ tool is the turbo version of the previous Active Directory synchronisation feature.Listed below are the three key areas that the API enables IT and Marketing to automatically sync from Azure AD directly to the Rocketseed hierarchy.Area 51, sorry #1Keep it in one spot.Simply put, holding staff email signature information in the Office 365 Azure Cloud, means you can seamlessly sync this information into the Rocketseed interface which automatically adds the updated information into all your employee email signatures.Over and above, we’ve powered up this feature so you can utilise additional un-synced signature data to be stored in Rocketseed.What does that mean for our customers? Apart from being bigger fans, you can feature even more fields in your email signatures than can actually be held in Azure Active Directory. Seriously!#2 Ground Control – IT managers put yo hands up! Will it make IT feel like they landed Apollo? Afraid not but… it does make their lives a ton easier.How? IT won’t have to log into multiple platforms or devices to keep company email signatures updated and accurate. All they have to do is keep the Active Directory up to date and Active Directory Boost takes care of the rest.Parent groups, sub-groups, and more sub-groups. For enterprise businesses this is key. All groups are now set up directly in the AD portal. SIMPLE, no Rocket science here. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 more thing – we shouldn’t take away from the set up either, takes ten minutes and it is a once off… that’s it done and dusted!#3 The budget that everybody wants – Marketing We relish brand guardianship, it’s pretty much one of the mainstays of emails signatures and we just made that much easier. Because after the one-time set-up, the Rocketseed Azure Active Directory sync gives you complete centralised ongoing control of your data. And with all updates, you know your company-wide employee email signatures will stay correct because Rocketseed email signatures are completely tamper-proof.So there’s no fear of individual employees getting ‘creative’ with their own individual email signatures… You know what we mean, Director of Moon landings vs Rocketsetship Coffee Supplier.All your branded company email signatures will be correct, consistent and compliant, with all the right staff details and perfectly on-brand.Rocketseed’s Azure ‘AD Sync Boost’: straight up, one of the strongest syncing tools out there and that’s why it is loved by Marketing and trusted by IT.
