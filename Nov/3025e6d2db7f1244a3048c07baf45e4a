In the case of the “helping communities grow” execution, some artificial grass frames the text. This, along with the ‘beads’ panel, adds a tactile 3D element to the campaign, as they stand out from the panel in question. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527692-625x418.jpg" alt="Standard Bank unveils 'spectacular' campaign at OR Tambo International" width="625" height="418">This is a long-term holding, with Standard Bank taking ownership of these zones and really showcasing its creative strength, with a total of 35 ‘faces’ rebranded and the seven 3D spectaculars primed to grab the attention of travellers landing in South Africa from abroad. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527693-625x418.jpg" alt="Standard Bank unveils 'spectacular' campaign at OR Tambo International" width="625" height="418">“It’s always encouraging and exciting for us when a client wants to challenge itself creatively and really maximise the opportunities that the Airport Ads bouquet of products offers,” says Mzi Deliwe, Deputy CEO of PMG and Head of Airport Ads. <img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1911/527694-625x418.jpg" alt="Standard Bank unveils 'spectacular' campaign at OR Tambo International" width="625" height="418">According to Airports Company South Africa (ACSA), OR Tambo International Airport processes approximately nine million international passengers a year, making for an attractive, captive audience and one that sits in the upper LSM segment – a perfect fit for Standard Bank Corporate and Investment Banking.
