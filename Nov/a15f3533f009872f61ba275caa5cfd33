This award provides a unique opportunity, notably for young people from Uganda and East Africa as well as talented photographers, to gain international recognition. Especially as the awards are growing in popularity year upon year. Last year, in 2018, we celebrated the inauguration of the East African Photography Award. The participation of Canon Central and North Africa (CNNA) alongside the UPPA has also paved the way for several practical workshops aimed at enhancing the skills of African photographers. These workshops form part of Miraisha, the programme we have been offering since 2014 to promote sustainable development in Africa,” stated Roman Troedhandl, managing director of Canon Central and North Africa.The winners of the eighth UPPA, the second East African Photography Award (EAPA) and the fourth Young Photographer Award (YPA), were announced on Saturday, 26 October at the Kampala Railway Station.
