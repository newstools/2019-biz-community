They are the ones who are opening the door and inspiring the next generation of women who follow in their footsteps.True global showcase of diversity“I’m proud of the level of talent and spirit embodied by this year’s Next Creative Leaders and their contribution to the industry,” Kat Gordon, founder, The 3% Movement. The majority of our winners are currently or originally from outside the US, making this a true global showcase of diversity, advocacy and opportunity for people of every ethnicity.To make the Next Creative Leaders program as open and accessible as possible, there is no cost for entering the competition. Entrants were judged on four-to-six pieces of creative work, their background, and information about how they — and their work — are pushing the industry forward and making a positive contribution in terms of diversity, mentoring and advocacy. Winners were selected by a jury of 39 top creatives, including a number of past Next Creative Leaders winners.
