As a direct consequence, women still receive only a tiny part of worldwide sponsorship deals.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1908/509713-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Nike South Africa's &amp;quot;Just Do It: Caster Semenya&amp;quot; wins Gold at inaugural Gerety Awards" width="120" height="120">Nike South Africa's "Just Do It: Caster Semenya" wins Gold at inaugural Gerety AwardsThe winners, including Nike South Africa's "Just Do It: Caster Semenya", of the inaugural Gerety Awards have been announced...1 Aug 2019So why aren’t the multinational companies interested in investing in sportswomen?According to Farhad Divecha, AccuraCast managing director, companies aren’t as interested in investing in female competitors because they can’t be ‘guaranteed’ the return of their investment back with greater media attention.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1902/484328-120x120.jpg?2" alt="Ros Goldin, an independent analyst and ex-marketing director for Cricket South Africa." width="120" height="120">Adapt or die for the modern sports fanOver the past decade, sports audiences have changed dramatically, making relevance key for a successful sports sponsorship...By Danette Breitenbach 26 Feb 2019Women’s sport at the forefrontHowever, comments Divecha, this may be changing, albeit slowly, due to the increase in social media activity around women’s sport.“There has recently been a positive change in the way women’s sport is covered by the media but over time this change has happened very slowly. Hopefully, social media will help to speed up fan interest, increase engagement with the sportswomen themselves – which, in turn, should lead to more media interest and therefore, more commercial investment.”Divecha works with sports brands across multi-channels to drive event ticket sales, generate fan loyalty, boost event viewership and grow kit/merchandise sales.SOUTH AFRICA<img src="https://biz-file.com/c/1608/354478.jpg" alt="New video encourages girls to keep playing sports" width="120" height="120">New video encourages girls to keep playing sportsA new video, Keep Playing #LikeAGirl, encourages girls to keep playing sports, as research from Always indicates that globally, more than two-thirds of girls have been told that they do not belong in sports...4 Aug 2016“It has always been important for sports clubs and organisations to attract and keep fans interested in every aspect of their brand. Digital marketing – especially social media marketing – is now at the forefront and has been embraced by the biggest of sports played by men. It is now happening slowly and surely in women’s sport, and we expect this to grow steadily from now on."Added to this, female competitors such as US football star Megan Rapinoe attract big followings on social media. This self-branding increases visibility of individual female sports stars and will, in the long run, help to attract more interest from potential sponsors,” concludes Divecha.
