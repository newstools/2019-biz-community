Measuring your strategies and tactics and adapting where required is critical, particularly in the African space.” With the recent Russia-Africa Summit held in October and the Bank of America reporting that Africa will become the land of opportunity for investors should the US and China trade war ease, it is clear that there is great interest across the globe to tap into the massive opportunities that Africa presents. The need for insights and intelligence gained from media channels on the continent is hence becoming critical for brands wanting to monitor developments and opportunities.
