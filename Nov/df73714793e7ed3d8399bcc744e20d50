Grant a wish for a child by simply donating a new toy at any Toys R Us and Babies R Us store or at the ECR house in Umhlanga between 22 October and 6 December 2019. All the toys collected will be donated to underprivileged children in government hospitals, orphanages and children’s homes in KZN. To make a profound and sustainable change to lives of little ones, this year the cash donations will go toward a school in need that is identified by the Department of Education. East Coast Radio’s General Manager, Boni Mchunu says that the Toy Story campaign is one that she is particularly passionate about as it addresses an imminent need in our country: education. “Every year during this time I feel a new sense of pride as I know that every year KZN come out in their numbers to support this life changing campaign. Last year we were able to make prominent upgrades to four underprivileged schools to help make their learning experience an easier one. We also collected and handed out over 10,000 new toys to children in our province, making their festive season a joyous one. This year with the help of KZN we hope to make an even bigger impact,” said Mchunu. Marketing Manager of Toys R Us and Babies R Us, Catherine Jacoby adds, “Toys R Us and Babies R Us are so proud to be partnered with East Coast Radio and with the Toy Story Campaign. A campaign that brings such joy and happiness to little children from all walks of life, something that we at Toys R Us and Babies R Us take pride ourselves in doing.”The launch of the East Coast Radio Toy Story campaign in partnership with Toys R Us & Babies R Us took place at the ECR House in Umhlanga with a number of celebrities and influencers in attendance. The campaign is now in its 19th year and together with the support of KZN has touched the lives of many across KZN.
